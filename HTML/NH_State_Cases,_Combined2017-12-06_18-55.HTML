Fam. Div. R. 1.30 recognized that parties' interests continued after a case was closed; [2]-The portion of the trial court's order which stated that any future lawsuit or the pleadings therein filed by appellant against DCYF and CASA had to be filed under seal constituted a prior restraint on free speech and limited access to the courts in violation of N.H.

R. Evid. 403 a telephone conversation between an accomplice and his mother, as the conversation contradicted the accomplice's testimony that he had not lied to protect defendant and thus was highly probative of his credibility, and the conversation was not unfairly prejudicial in that there was little if anything in it that would appeal to a jury's sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, provoke its instinct to punish, or otherwise improperly induce a decision against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The 5th Circuit Court -- Claremont Family Division (New Hampshire) modified the husband's child support obligations and applied a standing order requiring the husband to pay the reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the wife for any proceeding or matter related to the divorce decree and subsequent amendments. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that res judicata barred the husband's challenge to the standing fee order. Next, in calculating the husband's gross income under RSA 458-C:2, IV, the trial court properly gave effect to capital losses only up to the amount of capital gains realized during the same year. This better served the purposes of RSA ch. 458-C. The court held that with respect to income from a partnership, only those expenses that were reasonable and necessary for the production of income were deductible therefrom for the purposes of calculating child support. The trial court erred by using the husband's 2009 income instead of that for 2010 for purposes of calculating his present income. Finally, with regard to the order requiring the wife to reimburse the husband for overpayment of support resulting from the modification, because the statutory amendment to RSA 458-C:7, III affected only modification procedures, it was the date of the motion to modify, rather than the date of divorce, that controlled a retroactivity analysis. The husband's motion to modify was filed after the effective date of the 2007 amendment; thus, the application of that amendment did not constitute a retrospective law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court vacated the calculation of child support and reversed the trial court's ruling as to the husband's partnership income. It affirmed the rest of the trial court's decision. It remanded the case for redetermination of the child support award.</SPAN></P>

The Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire) granted summary judgment to the State on some issues and later granted its motion to dismiss as to the remaining issues. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the tax did not violate the uniformity requirement of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12 and N.H. Const. pt. II, arts. 5 and 6. The inherent differences between winnings from lotteries and games of chance and other forms of income justified their separate treatment for tax purposes. Furthermore, taxing gross gambling winnings, instead of allowing taxpayers to offset their gambling losses against their winnings, was not inherently unfair, unreasonable, and disproportional under the state constitution. Next, the taxpayers lacked standing to argue that the tax violated the federal dormant Commerce Clause. Neither taxpayer claimed to have suffered an injury due to an unjustifiable discrimination against or burdening of interstate or foreign commerce, and because the tax had been repealed, they could not argue that they would be so affected in the future. The taxpayers lacked standing to bring their as-applied challenges as annuitants or as professional gamblers. They did not claim to have paid taxes on gambling winnings from an annuity, and one taxpayer conceded that he was not a professional gambler under the test properly applied by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire certified the question of whether RSA 507-B:2 and RSA 507-B:5 were constitutional under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 14 to the extent they prevented recovery for plaintiff's claim for civil battery and damages against the town under a theory of respondeat superior.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that RSA 507-B:2 and RSA 507-B:5 did not infringe upon plaintiff's statutory or common law rights to bring a direct claim against the alleged tortfeasor, who was the police officer. Accordingly, plaintiff had not been deprived of his right to a remedy under the New Hampshire Constitution, as he had legal recourse to recover damages for his injuries from the party allegedly responsible for them -- the police officer. As for his claim that the statutes violated his constitutional right to equal protection, the court held that they provided immunity to municipalities for any intentional tort committed by a municipal employee under the same terms and conditions as RSA 541-B:19 provided sovereign immunity to the State for any intentional tort committed by a state employee. Thus construed, RSA 507-B:2 and RSA 507-B:5 did not result in different treatment of plaintiffs injured by municipal employee intentional torts and of plaintiffs injured by state employee intentional torts. Because the statutes were constitutional as applied to plaintiff, they necessarily were also facially constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that defendant chose to look down at a text message long enough to allow his vehicle to cross nearly three lanes of traffic into the opposite travel lane without returning his attention to the road. At no time did he brake or take any evasive action. According to defendant's own admission, he failed to notice any other vehicles until he struck one vehicle and went on to strike a second vehicle. This was more than a case of momentary inattention, such as might be caused by changing a radio station or sneezing. Here, defendant chose to divert his attention from the road to check a text message and remained so inattentive that he failed to notice that he crossed nearly three lanes of traffic and entered into the opposite lane in the face of oncoming traffic. Under these circumstances, the court could not say that a reasonable trier of fact, viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could not have found that defendant acted recklessly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant argued that for him to receive a felony-level sentence, the jury should have been instructed that it had to find that the stolen property consisted of firearms. The court, applying the plain error rule, held that any error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. The evidence that the stolen property at issue consisted of handguns was overwhelming. The evidence at trial concerned only handguns as stolen property; no other allegedly stolen property was discussed. Additionally, defendant did not dispute at trial, and did not dispute on appeal, that a handgun was a firearm. At trial, witnesses, including defendant, referred to the stolen handguns as &quot;firearms.&quot; Thus, the court would not exercise its discretion under the plain error rule to reverse defendant's conviction and sentence. Next, the court declined to reverse part of its Russell decision. Having failed to brief the four stare decisis factors, defendant had not persuaded the court that Russell had to be overruled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant filed a motion to amend his 2003 sentence for aggravated felonious sexual assault (AFSA) based upon an amendment to RSA 632-A:4 (Supp. 2002)  that took effect after the offense but before his conviction became final. The Cheshire Superior Court (New Hampshire) denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The 2003 amendment to RSA 632-A:4 reduced the penalty for sexual penetration between teenagers by making the offense a class A misdemeanor. The court stated that there was no indication that the legislature intended the amendment to apply retroactively. Accordingly, the default rule of non-retroactivity embodied in RSA 21:38 controlled. Moreover, in order for defendant to receive the benefit of the amendment, he would need to be sentenced under the misdemeanor sexual assault statute even though he was indicted, tried, and convicted for pattern AFSA. Next, defendant's sentence of 3 1/2 to 20 years was not rendered cruel and unusual and grossly disproportionate in violation of the Fifth and Eighth Amendments and N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 15, 18, and 33 by virtue of the legislature's later amendment of the penalty applicable to his conduct. Courts had rejected the argument that when the legislature reduced the penalty for certain criminal conduct, at least all sentences imposed pursuant to the original statute which had not yet become final and which exceeded what was authorized by the amendment were per se unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">A presiding officer of the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation found that respondent pooled risk management programs violated RSA 5-B:5, I(c) (2013) by failing to return all earnings and surplus in excess of any amounts required for administration, claims, reserves, and purchase of excess insurance to the participating political subdivisions. Respondents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that RSA 5-B:5, I(c) plainly directed a pooled risk management program to give back to participating political subdivisions the amount of money that remained after deducting from the program's total revenue those amounts &quot;required for administration, claims, reserves, and purchase of excess insurance.&quot; Thus, respondents violated RSA 5-B:5, I(c) when they purported to return &quot;all earnings and surplus&quot; to the subdivisions via rate stabilization instead of in cash or cash equivalents. The presiding officer impermissibly modifed the statute by requiring that the first respondent maintain as reserves a specific level of net assets and by requiring it to purchase reinsurance in the future. There was no violation of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23. The order created no new obligations. The presiding officer's refusal to recuse himself did not violate due process under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 35 and the Fourteenth Amendment, as respondents had failed to show that their motion to disqualify was not a last-minute attempt to avoid an adverse decision. Finally, because the court had vacated some parts of the decision, it remanded the issue of attorney's fees under RSA 5-B:4-a, V.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court vacated the requirements that the first respondent maintain as reserves a specific level of net assets and that it purchase reinsurance.

It affirmed the rest of the decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated, he sought a de novo jury trial in superior court. The 2d Circuit Court -- Lebanon District Division (New Hampshire) denied his request on the ground that his election to appeal to the supreme court waived his right to a jury trial in superior court. The Grafton Superior Court (New Hampshire) denied defendant's petition under RSA 599:1-b. Defendant appealed from both decisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that RSA 502-A:12 required a defendant convicted in circuit court of a class A misdemeanor to choose between appealing to superior court for a de novo jury trial or to the present court for the resolution of questions of law. The statute did not allow a defendant to pursue both avenues of appeal, either simultaneously or consecutively. That defendant believed that the classification was erroneous and intended to challenge it did not alter the conviction's validity at that time for purposes of determining the available avenues of appellate review. Next, RSA 502-A:12 dictated that by taking a direct appeal from a class A misdemeanor conviction to the present court, a defendant had to forego an appeal to superior court for a de novo trial to a jury; thus, he was deemed to have waived his right to a jury trial. This deemed waiver acted as a reasonable regulation on the exercise of the right to a jury trial and did not offend N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15 or the Sixth Amendment. Because the deemed waiver was valid, the superior court's failure to hold a hearing, and its denial of defendant's RSA 599:1-b petition, was not error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was seen taking photographs of children at a water attraction with his cellular phone.

After defendant admitted that he was attracted to young girls, that he had taken similar pictures elsewhere, and that he downloaded these pictures to his home computer, he was arrested for disorderly conduct. He then admitted to having child pornography on his computer. The court held that there was not probable cause under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 19 to arrest defendant for disorderly conduct. &quot;Threatening behavior in a public place&quot; under RSA 644:2, II(a) encompassed conduct posing a threat of imminent harm to other persons present, not conduct that merely caused discomfort. Photographing properly attired children in an open and public portion of a park, regardless of whether the photographs were of the children's backsides, were taken surreptitiously, or would be uploaded to a computer, did not warrant a reasonable belief that defendant posed a threat of imminent harm.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After a trial in the Strafford Superior Court (New Hampshire), defendant was convicted of two counts of second-degree assault under RSA 631:2, I(c) (2007), resulting in extended terms of imprisonment under RSA 651:6, II(a) (Supp. 2012).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that because the trial court had found that intervening events between the assaults and the victim's telephone call to a coworker precluded admission of the coworker's testimony under the excited utterance hearsay exception, N.H. R. Evid. 803(2), it was error to admit the testimony. The error was harmless, however, because the alternative evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming and because the contested evidence was inconsequential and cumulative. There was no double jeopardy violation under the Fifth Amendment or N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 16. Defendant was charged with two separate incidents of assault, which took place in different rooms; the fact that each assault resulted in injuries to the victim's head and neck did not establish that they arose out of the same act or transaction. Next, although defendant's prior convictions resulted in one uninterrupted period of incarceration, defendant nevertheless was twice previously imprisoned on sentences in excess of one year for purposes of RSA 651:6, II(a). Finally, any error in failing to instruct the jury that it had to unanimously agree on a specific bodily injury caused by defendant's conduct was not plain.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After a jury trial in the Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Northern Judicial District (New Hampshire), defendant was convicted of capital murder for the killing of a police officer in the line of duty and sentenced to death. He appealed. The court also conducted the independent review required by RSA 630:5, X-XII (2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that under RSA 630:5, III, the trial court did not err in admitting victim impact evidence consisting of brief testimony from four immediate family members, a limited number of photographs of the victim and his family members, and three short video recordings of the victim interacting with his sons. Defendant's right to due process under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15 was not violated by requiring him to prove mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence. The inapplicability of the rules of evidence at capital sentencing did not violate separation of powers under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37 or due process under Article 15. &quot;Death qualifying&quot; a single jury for a capital trial did not violate defendant's right to a fair and impartial jury under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 35 or due process. Because the use of non-statutory aggravating factors served only to individualize the sentencing determination after the defendant had been found guilty and eligible for the death penalty, the prosecutor's authority to select and allege non-statutory aggravating factors pursuant to RSA 630:5, I(b) was not a delegation of legislative power in violation of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

I, art. 19 and the Fourth Amendment by continuing the motor vehicle stop after realizing that the vehicle had an inspection sticker. Because the officer could not determine whether the transparent sticker was a valid one, he was permitted to engage in facially innocuous dialog which a detained motorist would not reasonably perceive as altering the fundamental nature of the stop. His request for the defendant's license, registration, and inspection paperwork was reasonably related to the initial justification for the stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The 9th Circuit Court - Manchester District Division (New Hampshire) made an interlocutory transfer of a case for the court to answer the question of whether the definition of a &quot;loaded pistol or revolver&quot; under RSA 159:4 (2002) encompassed a firearm with no cartridge in the firearm, and no magazine in the magazine well, but with a loaded magazine located next to it and easily accessible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that a &quot;loaded&quot; pistol or revolver might mean a pistol or revolver containing a cartridge in the chamber, or, more broadly, a pistol or revolver containing a cartridge in any position from which it could be fired. It held that the legislature intended the second sentence of RSA 159:4 to clarify that &quot;loaded&quot; should be defined according to the broader of the two accepted meanings. Therefore, a &quot;loaded pistol or revolver&quot; meant not only a pistol or revolver that contains a cartridge in the chamber, but also a pistol or revolver containing a cylinder, magazine, or clip with a cartridge that could be discharged through the normal operation of the firearm. This reading was consistent with the common and approved usage of &quot;loaded.&quot; The State's reading of the statute could render it unconstitutionally vague. Therefore, in order for a pistol or revolver to be considered &quot;loaded&quot; within the meaning of RSA 159:4, the pistol or revolver had to contain a cartridge in the chamber or had to contain a magazine, cylinder, or clip inserted in or otherwise adjoined to the firearm such that the firearm could be discharged through normal operation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court, having answered the question, remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner taxpayers filed an action against respondent town to abate &quot;land use change tax&quot; (LUCT) assessments. The Rockingham Superior Court (New Hampshire) ordered the tax abated. The town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the trial court erred in ruling that all of the lots of the subdivision changed in use on April 23, 2009, when the planning board granted final subdivision approval and a road had been completed. Under RSA 79-A:7, V(a), road construction alone did not necessarily remove from current use all lots or sites served by the road. Nor was the combination of the road's completion and the town's grant of subdivision approval sufficient to remove all surrounding lots from current use. The town was entitled to impose the LUCT on a lot-by-lot basis as disqualifying events occurred for each individual lot, so long as the conditions under RSA 79-A:7, V(a) were met. Because the trial court did not apply the proper analysis, remand was required. Next, retroactive application of the amendment to RSA 79-A:7, II(c), which extended the 12-month limitation period to 18 months, did not violate N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23. As of the effective date of the amendment -- April 1, 2010 -- the 12-month limitations period had not yet expired as to any notice or discovery of change in use that occurred on April 23, 2009; thus, the taxpayers had no vested right to rely on that limitations period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court vacated the trial court's decision. It remanded the case for a redetermination of when each lot changed in use and whether the LUCT bills were timely in light of the change-in-use dates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The Rockingham Superior Court (New Hampshire) sentenced defendant to both a stand-committed prison term of one to three years and probation for two years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant first argued that the trial court lacked statutory authority to impose a stand-committed prison sentence and a term of probation on the same charge. The court stated that under RSA 651:2 (2007), a court could impose probation, in addition to a fine or imprisonment, as long as portions of the maximum fine or term of imprisonment remained unimposed. Here, the trial court sentenced defendant to one to three years' imprisonment and no fine. The maximum sentence available for a class B felony was seven years' imprisonment, RSA 651:2, II(b), and a $4,000 fine, RSA 651:2, IV(a). Because the trial court retained a portion of its sentencing power as an enforcement mechanism, it did not err in imposing probation. Next, the sentence did not violate separation of powers under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37. In no sense did the imposition of both a term of imprisonment and a term of probation constitute the usurpation by one branch of the essential powers of another. To the contrary, should defendant simultaneously be subject to the authority of both the executive branch, on parole, and the judicial branch, on probation, the branches' respective functions would remain unimpaired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The indictment alleged that defendant failed to report his Myspace account. The trial court found that defendant was not required to report the account because he used his own name and his already-reported e-mail address to create the account. The court held that a Myspace account constituted an &quot;online identifier&quot; under RSA 651-B:4-a. Membership required the creation of a personal &quot;profile,&quot; triggering an obligation to report its creation to law enforcement. The fact that defendant used his already-reported e-mail address to establish the account did not militate against finding an obligation to report the account's creation to law enforcement. On the contrary, it highlighted that the legislature differentiated between &quot;electronic mail address&quot; and &quot;user profile information&quot; as independent examples of online identifiers. A user's Myspace account and profile were independent of the user's other methods of online communication or activity, such as an e-mail address. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The phrase &quot;user profile information&quot; in RSA 651-B:4-a provided a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand the conduct it prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">While an officer was investigating a complaint that a couple was not attending to their child, defendant repeatedly interrupted his attempts to speak to the couple and refused to leave. The court held that the statute did not facially violate defendant's right to free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I or N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 22. It was tailored to advance only the legitimate, content-neutral goal of allowing police to disperse those on the brink of engaging in unlawful conduct. The statute was also not unconstitutional as applied to defendant. It was not the content of his speech that caused his arrest, but the fact that he was interfering with the officer's performance of his duties. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Defendant demonstrated a design to interfere with the officer's efforts to complete his inquiry into the safety of the child. There was not insufficient evidence of a criminal investigation. The nature of the sort of investigation here often called upon the police to ascertain whether a caretaker was endangering the child's welfare; moreover, during the investigation the officer learned that the mother had an outstanding arrest warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">In a custody dispute, the 6th Circuit Court, Concord Family Division (New Hampshire), awarded primary parenting responsibility of a minor child jointly to petitioner father and to intervenor paternal grandparents under RSA 461-A:6 (Supp. 2011). Respondent mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that a trial court had no discretion to award parental responsibilities to a child's grandparents as against a fit natural or adoptive parent without satisfying the appropriate U.S. Const. amend. XIV standard for doing so. It held that two elements of the four-part Broderick test for awarding custody to grandparents had not been satisfied. The first requirement was that the custody award would specifically be in the child's best interest because of a significant psychological parent-child relationship between the child and the grandparents. Here, the record did not provide clear and convincing evidence that the paternal grandparents' status vis-&agrave;-vis the child was that of parents rather than that of ordinary grandparents. The record showed that they had never had primary parenting responsibilities for the child. It followed, then, that the trial court's order would not satisfy the fourth requirement -- that the award be necessary for the State to enforce its compelling interest in protecting the child from the emotional harm that would result if the child were forced to leave the significant parent-child relationship between the child and the grandparents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the trial court's decision. It remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff estate filed a medical malpractice case against defendants, a medical facility and a physician. After a New Hampshire trial court held that RSA 519-B:8 to 519-B:10 (2007), governing medical injury screening panels, violated the Separation of Powers Clause, N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37, defendants filed a petition for original jurisdiction seeking review of the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the statutes did not violate separation of powers merely because they were akin to evidentiary rules. The legislature had the authority to enact laws affecting evidentiary rules. As for N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 73-a, it merely endorsed the judiciary's inherent authority to adopt evidentiary rules, and was not intended to divest the legislature of its concurrent authority to enact statutes on this subject. Certain provisions, however, violated the right to a jury trial under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 20: RSA 519-B:8, I(a), to the extent that it precluded the introduction at trial of evidence and statements made by a party or a party's representative; RSA 519-B:8, III, to the extent that it prevented the parties from asking or compelling an expert, who testified at, or whose report was submitted at, the panel proceeding on behalf of the party's opponent, to testify at a subsequent trial; and RSA 519-B:9, I(f), to the extent that it required the trial court to instruct the jury that the parties could not introduce panel documents or present witnesses to testify about the panel proceedings, and that they could not comment on the panel findings or proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the trial court's decision insofar as it held that the statutes violated the Separation of Powers Clause. It affirmed part of the trial court's decision on the alternative ground that RSA 519-B:8, I(a), and III, and RSA 519-B:9, I(f) violated the right to a jury trial. It remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

After a bench trial, the Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Southern Judicial District (New Hampshire) held that there had not been a taking under the New Hampshire Constitution. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The owners argued that the city's actions concerning the development of a parkway over an extended period of time rendered their property impossible to develop or sell, effectively taking it as of 2004. The court held that damages arising from protracted delay alone were not compensable and that mere plotting and planning did not, without more, amount to an invasion of property or deprive the owner of the use and enjoyment of the property. While the possibility over a number of years that the property might be the subject of a future eminent domain proceeding might have, as a practical matter, interfered with the marketability of the property, it would cause but an incidental damage which was not compensable. The trial court did not err in choosing 1997 as the beginning date for determining whether a taking occurred. It was not until that year that the parkway was actually approved. Finally, the trial court did not err in not determining that a taking occurred where fairness and justice required that any burden imposed be borne by the city. The parkway required a substantial amount of planning, an important part of which involved disclosure to the community of the proposed action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">An officer went to the home defendant shared with his mother to serve the mother with a notice. While there, the officer saw three long guns. Because defendant's mother was a convicted felon who was prohibited from possessing firearms, the officer obtained a warrant to search for firearms. When officers executed the warrant, they learned that the three guns were &quot;BB&quot; guns and thus were not unlawful for the mother to possess. They continued to search the house. The court held that the continued search of the home was unreasonable under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 19. Police officers had to discontinue a search under the authority of a warrant when an unambiguous and material change occurred in the facts, eliminating probable cause. Here, police should have discontinued their search after discovering that the guns they had believed to be firearms were in fact BB guns. The warrant contained no other facts upon which the police might have relied in continuing to believe that the search was justified. While it might be the rare case in which facts discovered during the search clearly and unambiguously dispelled probable cause, this was such a case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners, a city, a county, and a school district, filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief and damages against respondents, the State of New Hampshire and the New Hampshire Retirement System (NHRS). Petitioners alleged that 2009 N.H. Laws 144:52 (section 52) violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 28-a. The Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire) granted the State's motion for summary judgment on the merits. Petitioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">In section 52, the legislature amended RSA 100-A:16, II to alter the percentages of the contributions required to be provided by employers and the State to the NHRS from a 65/35 local-state split to a 70/30 local-state split in fiscal year 2010, and a 75/25 local-state split in fiscal year 2011. The court held that to constitute a new, expanded or modified &quot;responsibility&quot; under Article 28-a, the state action had to impose some substantive change to an underlying function, duty or activity performed or to be performed by local government. If Article 28-a were construed so as to prohibit the legislature from adjusting (or eliminating) the State's contribution to NHRS for local police officers, teachers, and firefighters, the State would effectively be at the mercy of local governments with respect to the state budgeting and appropriations process. Nothing in the text or history of Article 28-a indicated that such a result was contemplated. Local subdivisions had long been required to participate in the NHRS, and section 52 did not modify this requirement. While section 52 resulted in increased expenditures, increased expenditures alone were not a violation of Article 28-a.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the trial court did not violate U.S. Const. amend.

The remedy he sought would have required a last-minute continuance; the trial court allowed him to explain his dissatisfaction with counsel; and the court could not say that counsel's strategic decision not to subpoena a witness was not supported by reasonable professional judgment. There was no plain error in admitting testimony that defendant wrote certain letters. The testimony was inconsequential in light of all of the other evidence pointing to defendant as the author. The trial court did not violate the Sixth Amendment in denying defendant's request for counsel at sentencing. It did not rely upon the mere fact of his prior waiver, but explicitly explained that the denial of the request was due exclusively to his inability to work with a series of lawyers appointed for him in the past. Finally, to the extent RSA 173-B:9, IV (2002) and RSA 633:3-a, VI (1996) conflicted, RSA 173-B:9, IV, as the more specific statute, controlled.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first stated that the United States Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence recognized a protected liberty interest for adults to engage in private, consensual sexual intimacy and applied a balancing of constitutional interests that defied either the strict scrutiny or rational basis label.

It held that RSA 632-A:2, I(g)(1) was not facially unconstitutional under this standard. The State had articulated legitimate governmental interests in protecting those who were vulnerable to exploitation and in maintaining the integrity of the mental health profession. Moreover, RSA 632-A:2, I(g)(1) was rationally related to those legitimate interests. It was rational for the legislature to impose a one-year limitation on sexual relationships between therapists and their former clients, as any coercive influence on former patients was likely to be at its strongest during the first year after the treatment relationship had ended.</SPAN></P>

It alleged that a fire was caused by defects in a water fountain. The Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Southern Judicial District (New Hampshire) granted summary judgment in favor of defendants based on the statute of repose of RSA 508:4-b (2010). Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Because plaintiff wanted the water fountain to blend into the wall instead of simply being hung on the wall, the contractor designed a back plate, attached the fountain to the back plate, and used a faux finish paint application to blend the fountain and the back plate with the wall. The court first declined to adopt a rule excluding product liability actions from the coverage of RSA 508:4-b. Next, the water fountain was an &quot;improvement&quot; to the property. It was custom-designed by the contractor to become a permanent installation in the funeral home's structure and constructed for the particular purpose of improving the home's aesthetics. Next, by covering actions arising out of a deficiency in the creation of an improvement, the legislature indicated its intent to protect only those who were involved in some way in the transformation of a product into an enhancement to the value or use of real estate. Thus, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the supplier, the retailer, and the manufacturer. The contractor, however, installed the fountain in a way that transformed it into an improvement and thus was entitled to rely upon the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment as to the contractor. It reversed the grant of summary judgment as to the remaining defendants.</SPAN></P>

The Cheshire Superior Court (New Hampshire) dismissed petitioner's statutory appeal under RSA 677:3 (2008) on the ground that petitioner's motion for rehearing was untimely under RSA 677:2 (2008) and granted summary judgment in favor of respondent on petitioner's declaratory judgment action. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that under the plain language of RSA 677:2, the 30-day period to apply for rehearing began to run the day after the ZBA disapproved petitioner's application by a vote on an oral motion. Thus, the zoning appeal was untimely. The court rejected petitioner's argument that respondent was equitably estopped from raising the timeliness issue. Although the written instructions given by the ZBA were incorrect, it did not appear that respondent made the misstatement with the intention of inducing petitioner to rely upon it. There was no evidence that the instructions were specifically created for petitioner; most importantly, the instructions warned the reader against solely relying upon them. The trial court did not err in its declaratory judgment rulings. Whether petitioner's proposed expansion of his nonconforming use was substantial primarily involved questions with respect to the characteristics of his property. Thus, petitioner was required to exhaust his administrative remedies. Finally, petitioner's constitutional challenge to RSA 674:41 (2008) was based upon a hypothetical premise not supported by the record and thus was not suitable for declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners, New Hampshire voters and the towns and municipalities in which some of them lived, filed an action against the New Hampshire Secretary of State in which they sought a declaration that the law redistricting the New Hampshire House of Representatives (the Plan), violated N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that because petitioners did not allege an equal protection violation, they had to establish that the Plan was enacted without a rational or legitimate basis. The overall range of deviation for the Plan was 9.9 percent. Petitioners argued that the legislature could have adopted a plan with a higher range of deviation that afforded more towns, wards, and places their own representatives. The court rejected this argument. Under federal equal protection standards, a plan with a maximum population deviation of more than 10 percent created a prima facie case of discrimination under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, while a plan that resulted in less than a 10 percent deviation was not per se violative of the principle of equal representation. Given this precedent, adhering to the 10 percent rule was a rational legislative policy. Furthermore, the court could not fault the legislature for giving primacy to the principle of one person/one vote. The legislature's choice to adhere to the 10 percent rule was a policy decision reserved to the legislature. Finally, nothing in the New Hampshire Constitution required a redistricting plan to consider &quot;communities of interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that because petitioners had not shown that the Plan violated the State Constitution, they were not entitled to the declaration they sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that RSA 72:23, III, did not fully exempt houses of worship from taxation. Rather, the buildings specified in RSA 72:23, III, were subject to the modifier &quot;owned, used and occupied directly for religious purposes.&quot; Furthermore, there was no merit to the church's argument that the statute did not allow apportionment between exempt and nonexempt uses. Apportionment did not violate the Establishment Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The BTLA never questioned the validity of the church's religion, but merely examined whether its property was used for religious training or for other religious purposes; the record did not support the church's argument that it had been singled out for application of the statute; and a taxpayer's religious beliefs were inadequate to determine whether land was being used for a religious purpose. The BTLA properly found that housing for a caretaker was not necessary for a religious purpose, as the property could be secured by other means. Because the church had not shown that a second-floor restroom was used for religious purposes, it was not error to find such space taxable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The victim was defendant's daughter. When questioned by the prosecution about his initial contact with defendant, a state trooper testified that he had been investigating an unrelated matter involving her sisters. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial. The trooper's testimony did not unambiguously reveal evidence of prior criminal acts by defendant. Furthermore, any inference that the unrelated investigation concerned criminal conduct by defendant was dispelled by the trooper's testimony that there were no allegations of any criminal conduct against defendant in that investigation. In addition, the trial court gave a curative instruction immediately following its ruling on the motion for mistrial. Next, the court held that resentencing was required under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15 and 18. First, the trial court's comments at sentencing implied that the trial court might have penalized defendant for his attorney's trial strategy. Second, the trial court's comments suggested that it might have considered defendant's failure to affirmatively express remorse. This violated defendant's right against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner, a retired probate court judge, brought an action against the State of New Hampshire and others in which he challenged RSA ch. 100-C (Supp. 2011), the Judicial Retirement Plan. Intervenors, other retired judges, joined the suit. The Strafford Superior Court (New Hampshire) held that RSA ch. 100-C violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23. The State appealed, and the judges cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that a judge's pension rights were an integral element of compensation and a vested contractual right accruing upon acceptance of employment. Thus, former RSA 490:2, 491:2, and 502-A:6-a created an implied-in-fact contract between the State and the judges who entered into employment when the statutes were in effect, which vested when they were appointed to be judges subject to age and service requirements. The trial court properly held that RSA ch. 100-C impaired the obligations entered into under the prior statutes. The judges had the right to expect that upon retirement, their pension would reflect subsequent increases in pay granted to those in active service. As for whether the impairment was substantial, remand was required to determine whether the impairment was offset by any compensating benefits under RSA ch. 100-C. Next, because salary adjustments under RSA 491-A:1 were authorized for the limited purpose of compensating judges for their 10 percent earnable compensation contribution required under RSA 100-C:14, the adjustments could not be characterized as &quot;effective annual salary&quot; for purposes of calculating benefits under the prior retirement statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the trial court's ruling that there had been a substantial impairment of the parties' contractual relationship. It remanded the case for the trial court to determine whether the contractual impairment was offset by any compensating benefits under RSA ch. 100-C. It otherwise affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant filed a motion to preclude the State from seeking an extended term of incarceration under RSA 651:6, II(a) (2007). The Strafford Superior Court (New Hampshire) denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant argued that the statute was ambiguous. The court rejected this argument. The court had previously made it clear that the legislature did not substantively amend RSA 651:6, II(a), in 2003; its intent in amending the statute was solely to comply with Apprendi, not to expand the circumstances under which enhanced sentences could be imposed. Despite the change from &quot;imprisoned&quot; to &quot;convicted,&quot; RSA 651:6, II(a) still required a trial court to find before it imposed an extended term of incarceration that the defendant (1) was previously imprisoned twice, resulting from (2) sentences in excess of one year. Here, defendant had served two terms of imprisonment resulting from sentences in excess of one year; thus, the statute was satisfied. Prior to his 2010 conviction of second-degree assault, defendant was convicted in 2002 of assault by a prisoner and was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of one and one-half to three years. He also was convicted of arson in 1998, and although he initially received a suspended sentence and probation on that conviction, he later violated his probation and was imprisoned on a sentence of three and one-half to seven years in prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners, two limited liability companies (LLCs) and their member, filed a declaratory judgment action against respondents, the New Hampshire Banking Department and its commissioner. The Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire) enjoined respondents from pursuing an administrative proceeding against the member. The trial court also denied petitioners' motion for attorneys' fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the trial court did not err in not refusing to exercise jurisdiction based on the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. Because a determination of the Department's jurisdiction required statutory analysis, the trial court could properly resolve this legal issue. Next, &quot;engaging in the business&quot; of mortgage lending required more than a single isolated transaction. Because each of the LLCs conducted only one mortgage lending transaction, neither engaged in the business of making or brokering mortgage loans under RSA 397-A:2, I. Thus, the member had no obligation to disclose the two transactions on his mortgage loan originator license application. Moreover, neither of the LLCs was a mortgage banker or mortgage broker under RSA 397-A:1. Thus, although the member became subject to the Department's regulation when he became a licensed mortgage loan originator after the two transactions by the LLCs occurred, he was not subject to disciplinary action by the Department based upon those transactions. Finally, the trial court properly denied attorney's fees. The Department did not act in bad faith, and petitioners were not forced to litigate a clearly defined right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court rejected respondent's argument that DOS was required to promulgate regulations relative to the administration of RSA ch. 270-E. Without some argument that harm resulted, the absence of regulations did not in itself require the court to overturn DOS's decision. Furthermore, because respondent did not argue that the privilege to operate a boat was a fundamental right, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15. RSA 270-E:17 did not impermissibly delegate legislative authority in violation of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37. It incorporated, by implication, the standards and policies in RSA chs. 270, 270-A, 270-B, and 270-E, which were reasonably definite and avoided an unlawful delegation of legislative power when combined. Furthermore, because administrative discretion was limited, RSA 270-E:17 constitutionally delegated legislative authority notwithstanding its lack of specific provisions relating to time limits. Finally, the notice respondent received was not inadequate under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15. Read as a whole, the notice was fair and reasonable, and it adequately informed her of the facts and legal standards involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff, a participant in a county department of corrections work program, filed negligence and respondeat superior claims against a corrections employee, the county, and the corrections department. The Strafford Superior Court (New Hampshire) dismissed his claims on the ground that they were not allowed by RSA 507-B:2 (2010). Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After plaintiff loaded a trailer, he was told to hitch the trailer to a pickup truck. While he was trying to do so, a weld on the trailer jack and/or the hitch failed, causing the trailer to fall on plaintiff's left leg and ankle. Plaintiff argued that his claims arose out of the county's &quot;operation of&quot; the truck and thus fell under RSA 507-B:2. The court, after reviewing cases, held that the entire range of activities inherent in the loading and unloading process had to be considered to determine whether a vehicle was being operated and that &quot;operation&quot; included participation in loading and unloading activities. The court held that plaintiff was involved in the loading operation when he lifted the fully loaded trailer and attempted to hitch it to the truck. Operating the truck included attempting to hitch the trailer to the truck. When the loading operation was viewed as a whole, the pickup truck was being operated at the time plaintiff was injured. Because it was not disputed that a truck was a &quot;motor vehicle&quot; within the meaning of RSA 507-B:2, plaintiff's claims arose out of the county's operation of a motor vehicle and thus fell within the scope of RSA 507-B:2.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">A jury in the Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Northern Judicial District (New Hampshire) convicted defendant of first-degree murder under RSA 630:1-a, I(a) (1996 &amp; Supp. 2005). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that it did not find that the legislature had expressed an intent to abrogate the principle that in order for a killing to be justified, it had to be reasonably necessary. Thus, the instructions requiring reasonable necessity for the defensive use of deadly force under RSA 627:4 (2007) were not erroneous. Next, the jury instructions properly assigned to the State the burden of proof as to all elements of the offense. To the extent the instructions erroneously advised the jury that the State could disprove self-defense or defense of others by establishing a third party's provocation of the encounter, this did not contribute to defendant's conviction. Any error in admitting a certain witness's testimony was harmless. In light of the alternative evidence establishing the animosity between the defendant and the victim, as well as the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, the testimony was cumulative. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a new trial under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15, and RSA 526:1 (2007). Disclosure of a witness's immunity agreement and plea deal in other cases would not have affected the ultimate verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The trial court found that defendant had harassed plaintiff as defined in RSA 644:4 (2007). The court first noted that it had found RSA 644:4, I(b) not to be overbroad under U.S. Const. amend. I. Thus, the trial court could properly consider defendant's repeated messages containing extraordinarily offensive and coarse language in determining that defendant had harassed plaintiff. Next, without a transcript, the court had to assume that the evidence was sufficient to support the result reached by the trial court. As for whether the trial court properly admitted certain text messages into evidence, defendant was unable to show, absent a transcript, that he objected when they were admitted. Thus, he had not preserved the issue for review. Finally, the evidence supported a finding of a present credible threat to plaintiff's safety under RSA 173-B: 1, I (Supp. 2010). The trial court specifically relied upon an attempted assault that occurred within six months of the filing of the petition, defendant's threatening statement regarding a loaded shotgun made within three months of the filing, and a further message including the words &quot;die bitch&quot; sent just days prior to the filing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner property owners (POs) appealed an order of the Superior Court, Grafton (New Hampshire), which granted dismissal motions filed by respondents, state agencies and a town, in the POs' equity and writ of mandamus action. They alleged that the town's actions in adjusting the water level of a pond adversely affected their properties and property rights, and disrupted the nearby wetlands ecosystem.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The POs' properties bordered on a wetlands, and had frontage on a pond that was located in the town and which was held in trust by the State for public use. The town owned property on the other side of the wetlands with frontage on the pond. It installed &quot;beaver pipes&quot; and changed its water release policy on occasions in order to stabilize the water level in the pond. The POs filed suit, which was dismissed by the trial court. On appeal, the court agreed with the dismissal. The action by the town in draining the water from the pond, thereby converting submerged wetlands to mud, may have been an annoyance, inconvenience, or caused a depreciation in land values, but it did not constitute a private nuisance. A takings claim, which was deemed one for inverse condemnation, failed for the same reasoning. There was no valid claim for a declaratory judgment under RSA 491:22, I (2010) where the petition did not evince a request for declaratory relief or a genuine controversy with the State with respect to an administrative rule. Use of the phrase &quot;petition in equity&quot; in the caption did not cure the pleading deficiency. The dismissal of other claims was deemed waived for purposes of appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff residential childcare providers brought a suit for breach of contract against defendant New Hampshire Division for Children, Youth and Families. The Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire) entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that the trial court properly found that provider service agreements (PSAs) were express contracts. The evidence amply supported the trial court's finding that there was a meeting of the minds, as the rate term was objectively unambiguous, the parties assented to it, and it did not condition rates on appropriations. Next, the parties' overall conduct showed that they intended the terms of the PSAs to apply to the services provided to non-Medicaid children. Given that the terms of the implied-in-fact contracts were identical to the PSAs, there was also a meeting of the minds for these implied-in-fact contracts. The 2004 and 2005 claims were not time-barred by RSA 508:4. Because plaintiffs were required to go to a hearing panel prior to pursuing their civil claims, the statute of limitations was tolled until the panel's decisions were final. Next, the waiver of sovereign immunity in RSA 491:8 (2010) nullified any potential separation of powers problems under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">A jury in the Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Northern Judicial District (New Hampshire) found that defendant was a sexually violent predator. Defendant appealed, arguing that RSA ch. 135-E violated his rights to equal protection and due process and that RSA 135-E:10, I, violated the Separation of Powers Clause, N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that RSA ch. 135-E did not violate due process under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV or N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15. Neither the procedures nor the burden of proof set forth in the statute carried undue risk of an erroneous deprivation of a defendant's private interests, and the State had a strong interest in protecting the public from, and providing care and treatment for, sexually violent predators. Next, RSA 135-E:10 did not violate N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37. N.H. R. Evid. 1101(b) stated that the rules of evidence applied to civil proceedings unless otherwise provided by statute, and the legislature had expressly provided that the rules did not apply to proceedings under RSA ch. 135-E. Thus, RSA 135-E:10 did not modify an existing rule of evidence. Finally, RSA ch. 135-E did not violate equal protection on its face under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 1, 12, and 14. Given the specific characteristics of individuals subject to civil commitment and the unique nature of the proof required to meet the statutory requirements for commitment, the need for different procedures was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff postal worker brought a personal injury suit against defendant shipping service after he was injured at work. After allowing the jury to apportion fault to plaintiff's employer, the United States Postal Service (USPS), the Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Southern Judicial District (New Hampshire) entered judgment in favor of defendant based on RSA 507:7-d (2010) and RSA 507:7-e (2010). Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff received benefits from the USPS under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act and then sued defendant. The jury found the USPS to be 90 percent at fault, plaintiff to be 6 percent at fault, and defendant to be 4 percent at fault. The court held that the trial court properly allowed fault to be apportioned to the USPS, an immune nonparty, under RSA 507:7-e. Requiring defendant to bear the entire cost of plaintiff's damages would contravene the legislative intent of the statute, which was to protect minimally liable defendants. Furthermore, apportionment did not violate due process under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15 or deprive plaintiff of a remedy under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 14. Because RSA 507:7-d was the companion statute to RSA 507:7-e, however, the aggregation of fault described in RSA 507:7-d included the fault of all entities to which fault had been apportioned, regardless of whether any were immune from liability. Thus, because plaintiff's fault was less than the aggregated fault of the USPS and defendant, he was not barred from recovery, although he was limited to the damages attributable to defendant because it was less than 50 percent at fault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed the trial court's apportionment of fault to the USPS and reversed its denial of recovery against defendant. It remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Respondent moved to South Carolina, abandoning her husband and her two sons. The husband later died, and petitioner sought guardianship of the minor. The court first stated that RSA 463:8 plainly provided a procedure for the substitution of a non-parent guardian for a parent; that procedure did not require a court to find the parent unfit. Next, the trial court had identified and applied the proper statutory standard--that is, whether petitioner showed by clear and convincing evidence that the minor's best interests required substitute guardianship to provide for his essential physical and safety needs or to prevent specific, significant psychological harm to him. The guardianship statute did not require a non-parent to present expert witnesses to establish psychological harm to the minor. Moreover, the trial court had made findings as to psychological harm. The trial court's decision did not violate respondent's fundamental rights under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 2 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The statute safeguarded a parent's fundamental rights by imposing a high evidentiary standard. Finally, the order did not have the practical effect of terminating respondent's parental rights.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of RSA 100-A:54, III (Supp. 2010). The Merrimack Supreme Court (New Hampshire) granted summary judgment for defendants. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Under RSA 100-A:54, III, a retiree's healthcare premium was deducted from his retirement allowance. The court first stated that regardless of whether defendants deducted the statutorily authorized healthcare premium from the retirees' pensions or separately billed them for the amount due, they still had to pay the premium. Thus, because the calculation of each retiree's pension remained unchanged, the deduction did not substantially impair the retirees' vested right to receive a full pension. Next, the plain language of RSA 100-A:26 (2001), RSA 100-A:26a (2001), and RSA 100-A:54, III demonstrated no conflict among them. Because RSA 100-A:54, III was consistent with RSA 100-A:26, the anti-alienation statute, it did not impair retirees' right to the anti-alienation protections and thus did not violate the Contract Clauses of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Finally, because there was no diversion of the pension funds under RSA 100-A:54, III and the retirement system assets were not being used to fund other state operations, there was no violation of N.H.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">An executive order reduced planned governmental expenditures. The court first held that RSA 9:16-b (2003), under which the order was promulgated, was not facially unconstitutional under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37. RSA 9:16-b did not involve the delegation of supreme legislative power, but the exercise of the executive branch's constitutional authority to carry out faithfully legislative mandates. As for N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 44, petitioners' argument was premised upon the assumption that RSA 9:16-b involved making or repealing a law, which was not the case. A reduction of expenditures did not constitute a veto. The statute was not unconstitutional as applied. RSA 9:16-b expressly allowed the Governor to implement the legislature's policy of maintaining a balanced budget notwithstanding any other law to the contrary. The executive order was not a taking under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12. Petitioners' right to supplemental rates was not a vested property right. For the same reason, petitioners' state and federal procedural due process claims failed. Finally, the executive order did not conflict with 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396.

The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in instructing the jury as to the mental state required for conviction. The word &quot;attempt&quot; in RSA 649-B:4, I(a) did not incorporate the attempt statute,&nbsp;RSA 629:1, I (2007), or the mental state of &quot;purposely.&quot; Accordingly, under RSA 626:2, I (2007), the mental state of &quot;knowingly&quot; applied to all of the material elements of RSA 649-B:4, I(a). Next, the court stated that the United States Supreme Court's statement that the identity of a defendant was never suppressible as the fruit of an illegal arrest was limited solely to jurisdiction. Accordingly, because the trial court had determined that defendant was illegally arrested under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 19, it should have excluded his driver's license, which was obtained after the illegal arrest, along with any testimony about the license. This required reversal and remand. Publishing the transcript of the Internet chat did not violate RSA 570-A:2 (Supp. 2007) because defendant engaged in online instant messaging and knew that the messages were capable of being recorded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After petitioner mother filed a motion to modify the terms of her divorce decree, the Newport Family Division (New Hampshire) granted intervenor grandparents visitation and unsupervised telephone contact with the mother's minor child and required her to provide transportation related to the grandparents' visitation. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that because the mother's constitutional claims had not been raised at the trial level, the court would not address them. Next, the court stated that in keeping with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Troxel and its own case law concerning the fundamental rights of parents, RSA 461-A:13 (Supp. 2009) required a narrow construction to comport with state and federal constitutional requirements. Accordingly, in applying RSA 461-A:13, a trial court had to weigh the first two statutory factors more heavily than the remaining listed factors, according due deference to a fit parent's judgment as to the best interests of the child as part of the trial court's determination of the child's best interests. Here, it was not clear that the trial court applied RSA 461-A:13 in a way that comported with the constitutional requirements of due process. Thus, the court remanded the case. Next, if grandparent visitation was awarded under RSA 461-A:6 (Supp. 2009), then RSA 461-A:4 necessarily applied to any such visitation. Thus, there was statutory authority to award the grandparents telephonic access to the child and to order the sharing of transportation responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the testimony of the victim and of police provided more than sufficient evidence of guilt. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to compel depositions of police officers and of a polygraph examiner under RSA 517:13, II (2007). Defendant could have challenged the voluntariness of his confession and moved to suppress it. It was not error under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15 to grant the State's motions to amend the indictments. Defendant had sufficient time to understand the charges and prepare any additional defenses before trial. The trial court did not err when it excluded evidence of the victim's prior and subsequent allegations of sexual assault under N.H. R. Evid. 403. There was no evidence that the other allegations were false. The trial court properly excluded defendant's testimony about the time of his arrival at the police station. Having persuaded the trial court to exclude testimony about a polygraph examination, defendant was not entitled to present evidence that would have misled the jury absent the excluded evidence. The trial court properly ordered defendant under RSA 651:63, I (Supp. 2009) to pay for the victim's future counseling costs.</SPAN></P>

The Jaffrey-Peterborough District Court (New Hampshire) found the petition true. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant sent 20 instant messages to the victim between 11:20 a.m. and 12:16 p.m. He argued that the trial court erred in finding that his conduct constituted &quot;repeated communications&quot; within the meaning of RSA 644:4, I(b). The court held that the plain and ordinary meaning of &quot;repeated communications&quot; within the overall context of RSA 644:4 was the renewed, frequent, or constant imparting of a message by any method of transmission. Here, over the course of 56 minutes, defendant composed 20 separate instant messages and sent them to the victim. This conduct fit squarely within the actions proscribed by the plain language of the statute. The court rejected defendant's argument that an instant message conversation resembled a telephone conversation. Instant messaging was the direct technological progeny of e-mailing and was a series of discrete electronic messages. Because the court found no ambiguity in the statute, the rule of lenity did not apply. Moreover, the statute's legislative history indicated an intent to provide for a broad proscription against harassment via the internet, the electronic transmissions of computers, and the technological advances therein.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner business organizations sought review of a decision of the New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) imposing real estate transfer taxes, interest, and penalties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners deeded property to single-purpose entities for ten dollars &quot;and other good and valuable consideration&quot; in order to obtain refinancing. The court rejected petitioners' argument that the transfers were not &quot;bargained-for exchanges&quot; under RSA 78-B:1-a, II (2003). Neither bargaining at arm's length nor payment of adequate value was required for a transaction to constitute a &quot;bargained-for exchange.&quot; In both transactions, money was exchanged for an interest in the property. Next, the DRA's use of the property's fair market value as a basis for the real estate transfer taxes imposed did not violate RSA 78-B:9 (2003). The DRA reasonably could have determined that the tangible benefits afforded the grantors far exceeded the purchase price and that the property's fair market value more accurately reflected the actual consideration given for the exchanges. Finally, it did not violate N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12 and N.H. Const. pt. II, arts. 5 and 6 to impose the real estate transfer tax when an entity had transferred property to a single-purpose entity in order to obtain refinancing. The tax applied uniformly to all taxpayers involved in a contractual transfer of real estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner mother, individually and as her child's mother and next friend, filed an action against respondent estate in which she argued that the trial court erred in treating the decedent's child support obligation as a support obligation under former RSA 557:27. A New Hampshire trial court granted the estate's motion to dismiss. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The mother argued that child support was a preferred claim under former RSA 557:24 (2007). The court stated that the mother's construction rendered the reference to child support in RSA 557:27 superfluous. The fact that the child support obligation was set forth in a divorce decree did not somehow transform it into a debt entitled to priority under RSA 557:24 (2007). The court was not persuaded by the mother's assertion that her claim was in the nature of a property settlement. Next, RSA 557:27 did not violate equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 1 and 2. The fact that the statute treated children younger than seven differently from older children was a classification based upon age and thus was subject to rational basis review. The legislature might have wanted to limit the duration of child support so that some residue of the decedent's estate would pass to his legatees. The mother failed to negative this conceivable basis for classifying children by age. As for the fact that the statute treated solvent estates differently from insolvent estates, the mother had not shown that this was arbitrary or without some reasonable justification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">A jury in the Belknap Superior Court (New Hampshire) convicted defendant of the first-degree murder of his former girlfriend's brother under RSA 630:1-a, I(a) (2007) and of the second-degree murder of the girlfriend under RSA 630:1-b, I(a) (2007). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the trial court properly admitted under N.H. R. Evid. 404(b) a witness's testimony that defendant had previously threatened to kill the girlfriend. Defendant had been charged with first-degree murder, and the threat was relevant to show specific intent. Moreover, the threat was made just two months prior to the murder and was made during the course of a heated argument between defendant and the girlfriend, which were circumstances similar to those of the night of the girlfriend's death. The trial court erred under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV when it admitted evidence of defendant's invocation of his right to remain silent. The error did not affect the outcome of the proceeding, however, in light of the overwhelming evidence against defendant. Finally, the trial court did not err under N.H. R. Evid. 403 in admitting a redacted version of defendant's second police interview. A jury could find defendant's statement to be dishonest and therefore probative of his guilt. Although there might have been some potential for the jury to speculate why the interview ended abruptly, the prejudice did not substantially outweigh the evidence's highly probative value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the trial court did not err in not permitting defendant to cross-examine the victim about prior convictions for animal cruelty. It was defendant, not the State, who asked questions intended to elicit statements from the witness about her ability to care for animals. Next, with regard to defense of premises under RSA 627:7 (2007), a rational juror could have found that defendant's belief that it was necessary to wave his pistol to terminate the victim's trespass was not objectively reasonable. While the victim drove past &quot;no trespassing&quot; signs onto defendant's property, she had been given directions to follow the roads with these signs by defendant's niece, who had then telephoned defendant to tell him that the victim was going to look at certain property that was for sale and might stop at his property. As for the sufficiency of the evidence, a rational juror could have found that defendant's actions of waving and pointing a gun toward the victim, while yelling &quot;get the F off my property,&quot; constituted felony criminal threatening. The mandatory sentence under RSA 651:2, II-g (2007) did not violate N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 18 or U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff New Hampshire Judicial Retirement Plan brought an action against defendant Secretary of State in which it argued that the Sudan Divestment Act, RSA ch. 100-D (Supp. 2009), violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 36-a. After intervenor New Hampshire Retirement System filed for a preliminary injunction, the Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire) enjoined the enforcement of the Act. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the Act was constitutional. Article 36-a required only that retirement system funds be used for the sole object of providing retirement benefits. The plain meaning of the ballot question amending the constitution to add Article 36-a, taken together with the events surrounding the adoption of the amendment and the statements of many of the delegates at the constitutional convention, made it clear that the voters contemplated only the problem of the day -- that is, the use of retirement system assets to fund other state operations. The Act did not require that the systems' funds be used for any purpose other than providing retirement benefits. It simply prohibited one possible investment option. The interpretation that Article 36-a created a constitutional trust went beyond the plain meaning of the words in the amendment and did not comport with the simplest and most obvious interpretation of the words used. Finally, given the absence of a definitive ruling and intervenor's failure to address it, the court remanded the case for the trial court to determine whether the Act impermissibly interfered with the trustees' fiduciary duties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">A jury in the Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Northern Judicial District (New Hampshire) convicted defendant of capital murder for the killing of a law enforcement officer acting in the line of duty. He was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed. The court addressed the process it would follow in applying RSA 630:5, XI(c) (2007) to its review of defendant's death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that under RSA 630:5, XI(c) a death penalty was &quot;excessive or disproportionate&quot; if it was aberrant from, or substantially out of line with, a pattern of jury verdicts which demonstrated that juries generally did not impose death in similar cases. Next, the court held that in considering both the procedural and substantive boundaries for &quot;similar cases,&quot; the comparison case inventory was restricted to cases in which a defendant committed the same kind of capital murder as the defendant whose death sentence was under review, a separate sentencing hearing occurred, the jury unanimously found predicate aggravating factors, and the penalty imposed was either death or life imprisonment without possibility of parole. In conducting its review, the court would use a precedent-seeking approach, under which the court would survey the case inventory and examine each case considering both the crime and the defendant. In this case, because it was the first death sentence subject to comparative proportionality review under RSA 630:5, XI(c), the court would consider published opinions of out-of-state cases to the extent such comparison would be meaningful for its review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court outlined the framework of the comparative proportionality review it would follow.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first stated that because petitioner was challenging the decision of the hearings examiner upholding a counselor's recommendation that he required further treatment, not any decision to suspend his license, he could not appeal pursuant to RSA 263:76 (2004). Because there was no other law providing for an appeal, petitioner's appeal was properly before the court pursuant to RSA 21-P:13 (2000) and RSA ch. 541. Next, N.H. Code Admin. R. Ann. He.-A 707.12(c)(3) required a counselor conducting an exit evaluation and assessment interview to issue a positive finding, thus overcoming the presumption of successful completion of an IDIP, if the client had two or more alcohol or drug-related motor vehicle arrests or convictions. This regulation did not modify statutory law, but filled in the details to effectuate the purpose of the DWI statute, which was to protect the public. Accordingly, Rule 707.12(c)(3) was promulgated pursuant to a valid delegation of authority and therefore had the force and effect of a law. It was also consistent with RSA 265-A:18, I(a)(3), which required a driver to furnish proof of successful completion of an IDIP prior to the restoration of his license.</SPAN></P>

The Rockingham Superior Court (New Hampshire) granted defendant's request to find him not chargeable with violating a probation condition that he have no computer access except for work purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that the probation officer had the authority to impose additional conditions on probation. N.H. Super. Ct. R. 107(l) contemplated that probation officers could set probation conditions. The mittimus stated that defendant was to be placed on probation upon any special terms of probation determined by the probation officer. Thus, the sentencing court in effect imposed the computer access condition, and it was a &quot;probation condition&quot; as defined by RSA 504-A:1, VII. The addition of a condition by a probation officer did not violate separation of powers under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37. The trial court retained the power to sentence defendants, and although the executive branch might be authorized by the court to impose conditions of probation, the judiciary retained the ultimate authority to review those conditions and to vacate them. Finally, because defendant was aware at the time of his sentencing that he was to abide by the conditions of probation established by his probation officer, his state and federal due process rights were not violated by the imposition of the condition by the probation officer.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that it was the general rule that a plea waived all claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights occurring before its entry. Therefore, by entering a new plea, petitioner waived any claim that the district court violated his constitutional rights by rejecting his original plea. In contrast to the case petitioner relied upon, here, petitioner admitted that his plea was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made. Moreover, petitioner's constitutional claim arose before he entered his new plea. The court added that it was troubled by petitioner's assertion that district courts commonly rejected plea agreements requiring payment of a fine when a defendant was financially able to do so. It strongly urged the district courts to follow N.H. Dist. &amp; Mun. Ct. R. 2.7. Pursuant to that rule, if a court found that a defendant was indigent, it had the discretion to defer payment, order periodic payments thereof, or allow the defendant to perform community service in lieu of payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners argued that the trial court erred in ruling that it was lawful to add the school board and municipal budget committee (MBC) recommendations to a proposed warrant article on the official ballot.

The court concluded that &sect; XI, A(5) did not conflict with RSA 49-B:1 (2003). A recommendation was not an exercise of legislative authority and did not change the charter or form of government. The charter also did not conflict with RSA 49-B:5-a (Supp. 2009). Nothing in RSA 49-B:5-a prohibited the district or the MBC from making recommendations with respect to the proposed amendment. The trial court did not err in ruling that adding the school board and MBC recommendations to the official ballot was lawful. That there was no specific statute that specifically authorized the recommendations was of no consequence. Section XI, A(5) provided the authority for adding the recommendations. No additional authority was necessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner mortgage lender brought an action against respondent website operator for injunctive relief. The Rockingham Superior Court (New Hampshire) ordered the disclosure of the sources of certain material, ordered production of all documents concerning petitioner received from a certain source, and enjoined the republication of a chart and an anonymous visitor's postings. Respondent appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">On its website, respondent posted a link to a document that purported to represent petitioner's loan figures (Loan Chart). In response, an anonymous poster left two comments regarding petitioner and its president. Petitioner alleged that the comments were defamatory. The court stated that the website served an informative function and contributed to the flow of information to the public. Thus, respondent was a reporter for purposes of the newsgathering privilege of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 22. Here, the trial court ordered the disclosure of the Loan Chart source and the production of the documents received from the source without analyzing the applicability of the privilege or conducting any balancing of interests. As for the poster, the Dendrite test was the appropriate standard by which to strike the balance between a defamation plaintiff's right to protect its reputation and a defendant's U.S. Const. amend. I right to exercise free speech anonymously. Finally, an injunction prohibiting republication of the Loan Chart and postings effectively functioned as a prior restraint. Petitioner's interests in protecting its privacy and reputation did not justify this extraordinary remedy.</SPAN></P>

It vacated the order requiring disclosure of the identity of the poster and remanded the case for analysis under the Dendrite test. It reversed the republication order.</SPAN></P>

Evid. 401, 402, and 403 in admitting toxicology evidence. It was relevant to show whether defendant had recently ingested certain drugs and was under the influence of those drugs. Because it was more probative than the other evidence of when defendant ingested drugs, it was not cumulative. The physician-patient privilege of RSA 329:26 had not been violated because defendant knew that a detective was in the room when a hospital staff person requested that defendant give a urine sample. Testimony about the test results for defendant's blood and urine samples did not violate the Confrontation Clause of U.S. Const. amend. VI. The witness generated opinions based upon his review of the test results, and defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine him regarding his opinions as well as the laboratory procedures and test results. The special findings submitted to the jury did not impermissibly direct the course of its deliberation. Finally, the element of being &quot;under the influence&quot; of a controlled drug under RSA 630:3, II could be proved by evidence that a defendant was suffering symptoms of withdrawal from drug usage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner taxpayers applied for a tax exemption under RSA 72:12-a (Supp. 2009) for two septic systems servicing their residential property. Respondent New Hampshire Department of Environment Services (DES) denied their application. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The DES found that the septic systems were pollution control facilities but that granting a tax exemption would not reasonably promote some proper object of public welfare or interest. The court held that this was error. RSA 72:12-a provided that qualifying pollution control facilities &quot;shall&quot; receive a tax exemption. Nothing in the statute permits the DES to exercise its discretion to deny an exemption to a qualifying facility. The DES's arguments relied upon a misunderstanding of the court's holding in Appeal of Town of Rindge. In that decision, the court did not intend to imply that any additional public benefit, other than pollution control, was required for a facility to be entitled to a tax exemption under RSA 72:12-a. Although the court cited specific examples of additional public benefits in dicta, it never held that these additional benefits were constitutionally required under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 10 and N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 5. As long as a facility qualified under the plain meaning of the statute, and thus promoted the public benefit of controlling pollution, the DES had no discretion to deny an applicant a tax exemption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The Belknap Superior Court (New Hampshire) denied petitioner's request for a permanent injunction to prevent construction and development of respondent's lot. It granted a declaratory judgment to petitioner on the issue of whether respondent's property had been merged. Petitioner appealed, and respondent cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that because petitioner failed to appeal the amended building permit granted to respondent to the zoning board of adjustment, she was barred by the exhaustion doctrine from challenging construction undertaken pursuant to that permit. Thus, the trial court erred in not granting respondent's motion to dismiss petitioner's request for an injunction to prohibit construction and development of respondent's lot. Next, the trial court did not err in finding that respondent's lots had merged pursuant to an ordinance's automatic merger provisions. The plain language of RSA 674:39-a gave property owners the right to merge contiguous lots, but nothing in its language precluded a town from automatically merging such lots pursuant to its zoning ordinance. The evidence supported the finding that respondent's lots had merged. Next, the trial court properly found that the doctrine of municipal estoppel did not bar the town from enforcing its merger ordinance. The evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that respondent knew or should have known that the representations made by town officials were materially incorrect; thus, any reliance was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the trial court's ruling denying respondent's motion to dismiss petitioner's request for injunctive relief. It affirmed the trial court's other rulings.</SPAN></P>

The New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission approved the petition against the utility company but not as to the two affiliates. It found that respondents had failed to rebut the presumption under RSA 38:3 (2000) that acquiring the utility's plant and property was in the public interest. Respondents appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that the PUC properly dismissed the petition as to the affiliates. They were not engaged in distributing water for sale in the city as required by RSA 38:6. The court did not interpret RSA 38:2, I, to allow a municipality to take a utility that was not engaged at all in serving municipal residents. Next, the PUC considered all of the evidence before it and engaged in the proper analysis under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12 to determine whether the taking was in the public interest. Under RSA 38:11 the PUC could condition its approval of the acquisition upon the city's fulfillment of certain prerequisites, even though, after the acquisition, the city would not operate as a &quot;public utility&quot; under RSA ch. 362. The fact that the PUC imposed the conditions did not mean that it was not fair and impartial under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15. Furthermore, respondents had ample opportunity to be heard about the concerns that prompted the conditions. The valuation under RSA 38:9, I, III and 38:10 was supported by the record, and the PUC did not err by requiring a mitigation fund of $40 million to compensate the customers of the affiliates.</SPAN></P>

N.H. Super. Ct. R. 28 gave a trial court authority to allow late filing of an affirmative defense as justice might require. Defendant alerted plaintiffs to its intent to raise res judicata as an affirmative defense only eight days after the 30-day filing period of Rule 28 expired, and plaintiffs had not shown any prejudice resulting from this brief delay. The trial court properly denied plaintiffs' motion to amend their appeal of the denial of their variance request. They did not seek to amend the appeal until nearly six months after the judgment became final under N.H. Super. Ct. R. 74; by then, the trial court's power to allow amendment had ceased. The trial court did not err in dismissing the inverse condemnation writ based on res judicata. The zoning appeal and inverse condemnation claim arose from the same factual transaction and thus were the same cause of action for res judicata purposes. The court declined to overrule its prior opinion requiring a landowner to bring an inverse condemnation claim at the same time as an appeal from a denial of a variance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After a jury trial in the Belknap Superior Court (New Hampshire), defendant was convicted of first-degree assault. He appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in permitting a re-evaluation of his competency to stand trial under RSA 135:17-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The State sought a second competency assessment on the ground that defendant malingered during his first evaluation. After defendant was re-evaluated, he was found competent to stand trial. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to order the re-assessment because it had impliedly dismissed without prejudice the original indictment by operation of law. For a case to be dismissed without prejudice, the trial court had to find that a defendant could not be restored to competency. The trial court had made no such finding. Next, RSA 135:17-a did not address specifically how a trial court should proceed if evidence existed that a defendant had procured a finding of incompetence through malingering or fraud. The court agreed with federal common law which held that trial courts possessed the inherent authority to order a second evaluation and competency hearing when there was evidence of malingering. The common law governing malingering was consistent with a plain and ordinary reading of RSA 135:17-a. Thus, RSA 135:17-a did not preclude a trial court from conducting necessary proceedings to determine whether a defendant was malingering.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners, policyholders under the New Hampshire Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association (JUA), filed an action against defendants, the State of New Hampshire, the Commissioner of Insurance, and the State Treasurer. The Belknap Superior Court (New Hampshire) declared 2009 N.H. Laws 144:1 (the Act) unconstitutional under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23, and other provisions. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that the language of the policies and N.H. Code Admin. R. Ann. Ins. 1703.07(d) conferred upon the policyholders a vested contractual right in the treatment of any excess surplus premiums collected by the JUA. The Act, diverting $ 110 million of purportedly excess surplus, impaired petitioners' contracts with the JUA. The impairment was substantial. It effectively eliminated the &quot;participating&quot; character of the policies, thus changing the very nature of the contracts, and it divested the JUA board of its obligation to the policyholders to treat any excess surplus for their benefit. Finally, although funding state programs for the medically underserved was an important public purpose, the court could not conclude that the means chosen to accomplish the Act's stated purpose were reasonable and necessary. It was not clear that all of the $110 million involved was in fact &quot;excess surplus.&quot; Further, nothing indicated that the Act was precipitated by an emergency or that it constituted a temporary measure, with future reimbursement of the funds contemplated. Thus, the Act was a retrospective law resulting in an impairment of contract under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was convicted in the Strafford Superior Court (New Hampshire) of aggravated felonious sexual assault and sexual assault in violation of RSA 632-A:2, I(g)(1) (Supp. 2008) and RSA 632-A:4, I(a) (Supp. 2008). The statutes proscribed sexual penetration and sexual contact when the actor provided therapy to the victim. Defendant appealed, arguing that he had not provided &quot;therapy&quot; to the victim under RSA 632-A:1, VI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was a part-time &quot;spiritual services coordinator&quot; at a correctional institution, where the alleged victim was an inmate. The court stated that RSA 632-A:1, VI defined &quot;therapy&quot; to mean &quot;the treatment of bodily, mental, or behavioral disorders by remedial agents or methods.&quot; It held that the legislature intended the term &quot;therapy&quot; to encompass activity whereby an actor implemented a planned action for another person's bodily, mental, or behavioral disorder by affording him or her some systematic cause or measure, procedure, or technique or particular approach in order to cure, remove, counteract, relieve, or abate that disorder. It held that defendant had not provided therapy to the alleged victim. Having regular meetings centered on different topics which ultimately generated encouraging and helpful discussions did not give rise to a rational conclusion that defendant engaged in a planned action or a systematic cause or measure, procedure, technique or any particular approach in order to relieve her bodily, mental, or behavioral disorders. Defendant's own characterization of his work as therapeutic in nature did not satisfy the statutorily defined dimensions of therapy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant pleaded guilty to two joint indictments of driving a motor vehicle after having been certified as a habitual offender under RSA 262:23. The Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Southern Judicial District (New Hampshire) ruled that RSA 262:23 prevented defendant from obtaining the benefit of a sentence to home confinement on both indictments. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that RSA 262:23, I, was not ambiguous. Accordingly, the trial court erred in reading the statute to preclude home confinement on the second indictment. By its plain language, RSA 262:23, I, made home confinement a sentencing option available only once in a habitual offender's lifetime. Habitual offender certification was already designed to address recidivism, and the court would not add to the penalty that the legislature had chosen to impose upon habitual offenders. Nothing in the plain language of RSA 262:23, I, precluded the imposition of concurrent sentences of home confinement for multiple violations of the habitual offender statute, subject to the &quot;once per lifetime&quot; limitation. On the other hand, it was within the trial court's discretion to decline to order home confinement under circumstances where, as here, the defendant had committed more than one violation. As both the decision whether to impose a sentence of home confinement and the selection of either concurrent or consecutive sentences rested within the discretion of sentencing judges, remand was required for the trial court's determination, in its sound discretion, of an appropriate sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court vacated the sentence. It remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant filed a motion to continue a hearing to impose a suspended sentence until after the disposition of collateral criminal proceedings. The Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Northern Judicial District (New Hampshire) denied the motion. Defendant appealed, arguing that the denial of the motion violated her right to due process under the New Hampshire and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant argued that she was forced to choose between her right to remain silent under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15 and U.S. Const. amend. V and her right to testify. The court rejected this argument. The decision whether to testify or to present evidence and witnesses at a hearing to impose was left to a defendant; it was a strategic choice. This choice did not force the defendant to make an impermissible election between two constitutional rights. For constitutional purposes, all that mattered was whether defendant had the option to testify at her imposition hearing. Even though she chose not to testify, she retained her rights to cross-examine the State's witnesses and to present evidence and witnesses in her own defense. The State still maintained the burden of proving that defendant violated the terms of her conditional freedom by a preponderance of the evidence. This standard did not compel or require defendant to testify or face certain imposition of her deferred sentence. Accordingly, the trial court did not violate due process by failing to continue the imposition hearing until after the criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant threatened to sue a beauty salon for discrimination because of its differing prices for haircuts. The owner paid him $500 to settle the matter, although defendant did not represent a client and had not himself been a salon customer. The court rejected defendant's argument that RSA 637:5, II(i) did not prohibit his conduct. It could not conclude that a threat to sue could never constitute extortion. It rejected defendant's argument that he had standing to sue under RSA 354-A:21-a, I (2009). Defendant had no preexisting relationship with the salon and had suffered no direct, compensable harm. RSA 637:5, II(i) was not unconstitutionally vague under U.S. Const. amend. I or N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 14 and 22. The phrase &quot;substantially benefit&quot; gave clear notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that the statute prohibited a threat that would not provide him with some actual advantage that was real and definite. The statute was not overbroad under N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 14, 22, and 32 or the First Amendment. The First Amendment did not immunize the pursuit of baseless litigation. Furthermore, &quot;extortion&quot; impliedly excluded legitimate claims to property through threats.</SPAN></P>

Defendant chief of police, acting for defendant town, denied him the license. Plaintiff appealed to the Rockingham Superior Court (New Hampshire), which dismissed the appeal and denied his motion to introduce late authority. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The superior court agreed with defendants that the action had to be brought in district court rather than superior court. Plaintiff argued that both RSA 159:6-c (2002) and RSA 159:6-e (2002) provided an avenue for appeal from a violation of RSA 159:6. The court held that RSA 159:6-e, read as a whole and construed in light of RSA 159:6 and RSA 159:6-c, applied only to alleged derelictions of a licensing authority's ministerial duties and did not provide a means to appeal a determination that the applicant did not meet the suitability or proper purpose requirements for licensure. RSA 159:6-c was, according to its title, an appeal provision, and it had been consistently interpreted as such. RSA 159:6-e, on the other hand, did not contain anything suggesting that it prescribed an appellate process. It provided a mechanism for injunctive relief, and the issuance of an injunction was an exercise of original, not appellate, jurisdiction. Next, because the superior court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over RSA 159:6-c proceedings, plaintiff could not be prejudiced by the trial court's failing to consider a case that purportedly advanced a legal proposition the court had rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant, who was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death after a trial in the Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Northern Judicial District (New Hampshire), appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant argued that the plain language of RSA 630:5, XI (2007), as well as the state and federal constitutions, required that the review be conducted under special rules. The court rejected this argument. The portion of the statute requiring that cases &quot;shall be heard in accordance with rules adopted by said court&quot; did not require special rules. Instead, based upon its plain language, the statute required simply that the court have appellate rules and that such rules were followed. Thus, the court's review of death sentences could be completed consistent with its preexisting appellate rules. Next, although N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 15, 18, and 33 entitled a defendant to a fair appellate procedure, free from arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, the constitution did not require that the procedure be adopted through the formal rulemaking process. Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court had never mandated formal rulemaking for review of death penalty cases. Neither the state nor the federal constitution mandated formal rulemaking; thus, RSA 630:5 and the New Hampshire Supreme Court Rules governed appellate procedure in capital sentence review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that cremation certificates were not recordable writings under RSA 638:2 because they were not similar to the documents affecting property interests that were enumerated there. Thus, defendant's conduct did not violate the statute. Next, defendant requested and received payment from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for viewing bodies before they were cremated in New Hampshire and in fact viewed these bodies. Thus, the theft by taking charge was not supported by sufficient evidence, as a rational juror could not have found that defendant collected money from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for services he failed to perform. A rational juror could find that defendant committed theft by deception by signing cremation certificates indicating he had viewed the remains of certain decedents when he had not done so and that he engaged in this conduct to receive fees. New Hampshire had jurisdiction over those offenses under RSA 625:4, I(a) (2007) because defendant took money from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by submitting medical examiner fee forms to a New Hampshire entity in New Hampshire that gave the false impression that he had examined bodies in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The grandmother had relinquished her parental rights to the grandchildren's mother. The grandmother and the mother later reunited, however, and were very close until the mother died from cancer. The court first held that because the grandmother gave birth to the children's mother, she was the children's &quot;natural&quot; grandmother under RSA 461-A:13. Next, when a conflict existed between two statutes, the later statute controlled, especially when the later statute dealt with a subject in a specific way and the earlier enactment treated that subject in a general fashion. Thus, the specific grandparent visitation statute, which was first enacted in 1989, controlled over the more general adoption laws. Finally, the grandmother's right to seek visitation under RSA 461-A:13 was not merely derivative of her parental rights to the children's mother, which the grandmother had relinquished. The policy justifications for requiring anonymity or preventing contact between the grandmother and the grandchildren were not present, as the grandmother and the mother had reunited and had a loving, close relationship. Furthermore, the grandmother had an existing relationship with the grandchildren.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court, Rockingham (New Hampshire), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle after having been certified as a habitual offender (HO), in violation of RSA 262:23 (Supp. 2008). The trial court had denied defendant's suppression motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Based on defendant's prior certification as a HO, his driving privileges were revoked for a minimum of four years. However, within that four-year period, a police officer observed a sport utility vehicle driving through a parking lot with the bass of the radio at an unnecessarily loud volume that violated Hampton, N.H., Mun. Ordinance art. 7, &sect; 3:704(a). After the officer stopped the vehicle, a record check revealed that defendant, who was driving, was a certified HO. Defendant was arrested and he sought suppression based on an unlawful seizure. The trial court denied suppression, finding that even if &sect; 3:704(a) was unconstitutional, the officer's good faith reliance on it was an exception to the exclusionary rule. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court held that upon assuming that &sect; 3:704(a) was unconstitutional, there was no cause for suppression. It adopted an exception to the exclusionary rule of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 19 based on an officer's objectively reasonable reliance on the constitutionality of an ordinance. The officer properly conducted the investigatory stop based on his reasonable suspicion that &sect; 3:704(a) was being violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner abutting property owner appealed an order of the Superior Court, Rockingham (New Hampshire), which granted summary judgment to respondent game club. The trial court held that RSA ch. 159-B (Supp. 2008) barred the owner's action, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief based on an alleged private nuisance by the club. The trial court also held that ch. 159-B was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The game club operated a shooting range on the property pursuant to RSA 159-B:8, II. The owner purchased property that was used as a campground. Two years later, the club purchased a forested lot between the shooting range and the owner's property, which was cleared upon approval of the board of selectmen (BOS) and used for, inter alia, additional parking. However, that approval was revoked because the BOS determined that approval of the planning board (PB) was required. The PB ultimately approved it upon the club's satisfaction of noise mitigation measures, which decision was affirmed by the trial court. The owner thereafter brought suit, which resulted in summary judgment for the club. On appeal, the court found that RSA 159-B:2 was inapplicable, but that the condition precedent of RSA 159-B:5 was satisfied. Accordingly, the nuisance claims were statutorily barred by both &sect;&sect; 159-B:2 and :5. The owner waived a challenge to the trial court's determination that RSA 676:15 was not a viable remedy. As the owner only challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 159-B:2, and &sect; 159-B:5 provided an alternate basis upon which to rely for the judgment, the constitutional challenge was not reached.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The teachers retired early from their school district and pursuant to their collective bargaining agreement, they each received a &quot;separation benefit&quot; representing certain unused sick leave. They also received ERBs that consisted of participation in a health insurance plan and a single cash payment according to the teacher's age. Each teacher applied to the NHRS and qualified for a service retirement annuity, but their ERBs were not deemed exempt from the 150 percent cap on earnable compensation pursuant to &sect; 100-A:1, XVII. On administrative appeal, the BOT affirmed that decision. The teachers' request for a writ of certiorari was granted. The court held that the teachers failed to meet their burden under 1991 N.H. Laws 313:7 of showing that the NHRS erred in determining that the severance pay was not based on unused, pre-1991 sick time. There was no collateral estoppel effect because the issue had not been previously litigated. The court also found no impairment of contract under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23, and no equal protection violation under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 2 and 12.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiffs, individual counties and an association of counties, filed suit against defendants, State of New Hampshire and the Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services. They sought injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that certain statutes violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 28-a. The Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire) entered summary judgment in favor of the State. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The acts involved the counties' share of nursing home and other costs. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that 2007 N.H. Laws 263, which extended a bill's sunset provisions, violated art. 28-a because it mandated a new obligation for county payments after the obligation was to cease. The extension was merely a continuation of an obligation predating the enactment of art. 28-a. The fact that the bill required the counties' approval and had been approved did not mean that the State was bound by its repeal language after approval. The legislature had the authority to amend any statute, consistent with the constitution. Next, with regard to fiscal years 2011 through 2013, 2007 N.H. Laws 263 stated that caps on total billings were to be established by the legislature. Thus, the fiscal obligation of the counties for those years was speculative, and the uncertainty surrounding potential cost increases did not create a clear and substantial conflict with the constitution. Thus, the issue was not ripe for review. Finally, the statute requiring the Local Medical Assistance Contribution had been repealed. Therefore, the issue of whether 2005 N.H. Laws 177 violated art. 28 was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The State petitioned the trial court for civil commitment of respondent inmate under RSA ch. 135-E on the ground that he was a sexually violent predator. The Hillsborough-Northern Judicial District (New Hampshire) transferred to the present court the question of whether RSA 135-E:10 (Supp. 2008) and RSA 135-E:15 (Supp. 2008) violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 23 by retrospectively taking away or impairing a vested right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court noted that RSA 135-E:19 (Supp. 2008) evinced an express legislative intent for retroactive application. Thus, the question was whether such retroactive application was constitutionally permissible. The court affirmed its prior holdings and concluded that the statutory and other similar evidentiary privileges abrogated by RSA 135-E:10, I, were creatures of public policy and subject to retrospective alteration or elimination. Next, any clear right to medical confidentiality in prisons could only be said to exist by virtue of statute, administrative regulation, or the common law of torts. Thus, because the confidential status of respondent's records was purely dependent upon the existence of statutory, administrative, or common law, the court could not say that he acquired a vested right to medical confidence. Finally, neither statute impaired respondent's contracts. Two documents signed by respondent indicated that communications with his therapist would not be completely confidential, and another document informed him that a discharge summary prepared upon completion of a sexual offender treatment program could be released to the courts during any legal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Belknap County Superior Court (New Hampshire) held that the fee violated Part I, Article 14 of the New Hampshire Constitution. The Office of Mediation and Arbitration (OMA) filed a motion to intervene, which the trial court granted. It then granted a motion for interlocutory transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that the OMA had standing to intervene in the matter under Superior Court Rule 139. The fact that the OMA was a party for the first time on appeal did not mean that the trial court had not had the opportunity to rule on the issues; it had ruled upon the rule's constitutionality. Furthermore, the fact that there were other means of recovering the fee did not preclude the OMA from having standing to appeal. Its sole purpose for intervening was to determine the rule's constitutionality. Its choice to intervene instead of filing a petition for declaratory judgment or a small claims action should not jeopardize its pursuit of a potentially meritorious claim. Next, the fact that the rule was temporary did not mean that the case could not have been transferred. Finally, the trial court erred in holding that the fee violated the constitution. Dismissal for a plaintiff's failure to pay a filing or administrative fee, such as the instant one, was both reasonable and constitutional. If a defendant refused to pay the fee, the constitution did not prohibit the State from taking measures to recover the fee, but a sanction could not include judgment against the defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff political party filed an action against defendant State of New Hampshire, in which the first and second intervenors, other political parties, intervened. After the Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire) found RSA 654:46 to be unconstitutional, it ordered the parties not to distribute certain lists but did not require the first intervenor to disgorge any funds obtained from selling the lists. The second intervenor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">RSA 654:46 required the Secretary of State, upon the request of a party, to furnish certain lists of voting information compiled by the State to that party. Both intervenors obtained the lists, after which the first intervenor sold them to various groups. Subsequently, the trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional, after which the second intervenor intervened. The court held that the second intervenor lacked standing to appeal. Any financial or political advantage potentially gained by the first intervenor from selling the lists was not, in any meaningful sense, an injury to the second intervenor. Additionally, the only issue on appeal was the correctness of the equitable remedy crafted by the trial court. As the second intervenor had not suffered legal harm, it could not show any prejudice sufficient to overturn the trial court's equitable ruling. Finally, the second intervenor contended that any funds obtained by the first intervenor through the sale of the lists ought to be disgorged and paid to the Secretary of State, who opted not to pursue a financial remedy. Accordingly, the relief sought was for the benefit of another party who had chosen not to request it.</SPAN></P>

I, art. 22 as applied to the specific facts of the case. The only evidence in the record as to defendant's intent was that he intended to make pornography, which as a general rule could be banned only if obscene. There was, therefore, no finding by the trial court that defendant's request to make a movie was for an illegitimate purpose. The State had not charged defendant with offering to pay the couple to engage in sexual contact, which under 632-A:1, IV (2007) would have required the State to prove that he acted for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification and thus engaged in conduct that was not constitutionally protected. Accordingly, the court's holding would not prevent the State from continuing to prosecute prostitution, even when the acts were videotaped.</SPAN></P>

He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant first argued that because he had bought the tokens from the State before it stopped accepting them, he had a contract with the State. The court stated that defendant's argument that he had a contract was insufficient to prevent criminal liability; his remedy for any contract claim was a civil action, not violation of the Criminal Code. Next, defendant's argument that his act was one of civil disobedience was without merit, as he was not claiming that RSA 637:8, I was unconstitutional. Next, assuming that theft of services required evidence sufficient to show that a defendant acted purposely, there was sufficient evidence that he had the requisite mental state. Defendant testified that his conscious object was to pay the toll with tokens that he knew were no longer accepted. Finally, as to defendant's argument that the tokens were gift certificates and could not lawfully expire under RSA 358-A:2, XIII, there was no evidence that they had an expiration date when he purchased them. Moreover, if the legislature's decision to stop using tokens was a violation of the Consumer Protection Act, RSA ch. 358-A (1995 &amp; Supp. 2008), defendant's remedy was under that statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant claimed that he had no memory of the accident that gave rise to the charges against him and thus could not consult with and assist trial counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding. The court stated that a claim of loss of memory alone did not automatically raise a bona fide or a legitimate doubt triggering a due process right to a competency hearing. A defendant could consult with and assist his trial counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding without necessarily remembering an event. As the record essentially contained only a representation that defendant suffered amnesia, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that no bona fide or legitimate doubt arose as to his competency. Thus, the court could not say that it erred in denying his motion. Next, by not briefing certain evidentiary arguments, defendant had waived them. As for defendant's contention that RSA 265:93 was unconstitutional on its face, the trial court had not relied on it. Thus, the court did not have to address defendant's challenge to it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant pleaded guilty to being a habitual offender under RSA 262:23 (2004). The Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Southern Judicial District (New Hampshire) sentenced her to 12 months in the House of Corrections. It held that the home confinement provisions of RSA 262:23 violated equal protection under N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 1 and 2 and the Fourteenth Amendment. Both defendant and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional on the ground that Hillsborough County was the only New Hampshire county that lacked a home confinement program. It found, however, that defendant did not qualify for home confinement because she had been charged with two distinct violations of RSA 262:23. The court did not reach the issue of defendant's eligibility. Instead, applying a rational basis test, it held that it was not inconceivable that the legislature could have intended to allow each county to undertake a separate cost-benefit analysis with respect to a home confinement program. Such a purpose was not irrational. Furthermore, courts had often upheld intra-state differences if persons within each territory were treated alike and constitutional protections were not otherwise abridged. Here, defendant was not treated differently from any other defendant in Hillsborough County convicted of violating RSA 262:23, I, for no such defendant was eligible for home confinement. Therefore, the statute did not violate her right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the trial court's ruling on the constitutionality of the statute. It affirmed defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After a trial in the Rockingham Superior Court (New Hampshire), defendant was convicted of being a felon in possession of a deadly weapon under RSA 159:3, I (2002). He appealed, arguing that under the circumstances, a bow and arrow was not a deadly weapon under RSA 625:11, V (2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant used a bow and arrow to kill a porcupine on his property. The court stated that because a bow and arrow was not one of the enumerated weapons in RSA 159:3, I(a), it had to fall within the definition of &quot;deadly weapon&quot; under RSA 625:11, V. Thus, the State was required to prove not only that defendant possessed the bow and arrow, but that in the manner he used, intended to use, or threatened to use the bow and arrow, it was capable of producing death or serious bodily injury. The court held that RSA 625:11, V should be construed to include only death or serious bodily injury to a human. To hold otherwise rendered the statute impermissibly vague, as such an expansive interpretation would not provide the ordinary person with adequate notice of those substances or things which would constitute a deadly weapon. To the extent that the State argued that a bow and arrow was inherently a deadly weapon, the court disagreed. It was the manner in which the &quot;other substance or thing&quot; was used, and the circumstances surrounding its use, that made it a deadly weapon under RSA 625:11, V. Thus, the death of the porcupine was insufficient to convict the defendant under RSA 159:3, I.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner town appealed from an order of the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (DES) that granted respondent university a tax exemption under RSA 72:12-a (2003) for its wastewater treatment facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first rejected the town's argument that because the university was not an industry, the exemption did not apply to it. RSA 72:12-a, I, made no reference to &quot;industry&quot; and could not be fairly read to imply such a limitation. Furthermore, the statute did not bar the DES from granting tax exemptions for pollution control facilities that were required by law. The statute specifically gave it the authority to grant an exemption for &quot;any&quot; treatment facility intended to reduce, control, or eliminate pollution. Managing wastewater reduced, controlled, or eliminated pollution; therefore, the DES reasonably found that the facility fell under the statute. There was no merit to the argument that human waste was not &quot;pollution&quot; under the statute, which was to be construed broadly. Next, the exemption did not violate N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 5 and N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 10. It was supported by just reasons, which included controlling pollution and fulfilling an obligation that otherwise might fall upon the town. Furthermore, the exemption did not create an unconstitutional unequal benefit. It advanced a valid public purpose which was properly within the legislature's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After a bench trial, the Carroll Superior Court (New Hampshire) convicted defendant of possession of child pornography in violation of RSA 649-A:3 (2007). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that in child pornography cases, the State was not required to present evidence beyond the images themselves to establish that a real child was depicted. Here, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that each image depicted a real child without the aid of expert testimony. Moreover, the State had presented expert testimony in this regard. Next, the court rejected defendant's argument that the State failed to prove that he knowingly possessed certain images because they were located in either deleted files or in unallocated hard drive space on his computer. Defendant, communicating with a detective posing as a fictitious child, stated that he possessed child pornography and that he would bring some with him on a disc when he met the child. Furthermore, another image that was a trial exhibit was saved to defendant's hard drive, and there was evidence of additional images found on defendant's computer. Finally, under RSA 649-A:3, time was not an element of the crime. Therefore, any discrepancy as to the date of possession was not fatal to the State's case, as long as possession could be found on or about the date alleged in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff obtained a final protective order against defendant under RSA 633:3-a, III-c (2007). The Hampton District Court (New Hampshire) granted plaintiff's request to extend the order for an additional five years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff did not dispute defendant's claim that he had complied with the order since June 2006. She stated that she requested an extension because of defendant's previous violations. The court stated that for a showing of &quot;good cause,&quot; a trial court had to assess whether current conditions were such that there was still a concern for a plaintiff's safety and well-being. Under this standard, defendant's compliance with the order over the previous 15 months did not bar an extension. There was sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that defendant's actions in driving by plaintiff's residence multiple times in violation of the protective order only 15 months earlier, together with plaintiff's reasonable fear, constituted good cause. Finally, the term &quot;good cause&quot; was not impermissibly vague on its face or as applied to defendant and thus did not violate defendant's federal due process rights. Defendant knew or should have known that if he violated the original order, it could be extended. The court would not find a statute unconstitutionally vague simply because it did not precisely apprise an individual of the standards by which the decision would be made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court upheld the trial court's decision to grant the extension.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners, towns, legislators, candidates, voters, and public officials, filed an action against respondent Secretary of State. They sought a declaration that RSA 662:5 (2008) was unconstitutional under N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 11. They also sought to enjoin the 2008 primary and general elections. The Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire) denied petitioners relief. Petitioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The trial court assumed that the statutory redistricting scheme within RSA 662:5 did not comply with the amended language of Article 11. It concluded, however, that Article 11 established that the mandated redistricting take place at the regular legislative session following the next federal decennial census. Petitioners argued that redistricting was required prior to the 2008 primary and general elections. The court stated that the plain meaning of Article 11 required reapportionment each decade at the regular session following the federal census. Immediate reapportionment was therefore unnecessary because the next federal decennial census would not be conducted until 2010. The court rejected petitioners' argument that its construction violated the essential right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice. Decennial reapportionment was a rational approach to readjustment of legislative representation, and compliance with such an approach clearly met the minimal requirements for maintaining a reasonably current scheme of legislative representation, while recognizing the need for stability and continuity in the organization of the legislative system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After petitioners, a school district and others, brought suit against the State of New Hampshire, the Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Southern Judicial District (New Hampshire) declared a statute governing education funding unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling and retained jurisdiction. After the legislature enacted new legislation, the court requested the parties to file memoranda in light of the new laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">In its previous decision, the court found that the original law, HB 616, had failed to define a constitutionally adequate education. It retained jurisdiction over the core definitional issues pending legislative response. Subsequently, the legislature enacted 2007 N.H. Laws 270 and 2008 N.H. Laws 173. The court held that the action was moot. A challenge seeking only prospective or declaratory relief was generally mooted where intervening legislative activity rendered the prior law inapplicable. Although the court was hesitant to dismiss an action as moot when it implicated constitutional rights and duties, there was no indication that either new law was substantially similar to HB 616. The court presumed that in enacting the new laws, the legislature acted in good faith and crafted a responsive mandate intended to address the constitutional infirmities of the prior legislation. Although petitioners argued that the new legislation presented new problems, it was precisely for this reason that the controversy was now moot. HB 616, as it related to the original petition, was no longer in effect, and retaining jurisdiction would not cure continued uncertainty in the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court dismissed the appeal without prejudice as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Because defendant had been a police officer in Merrimack County for 17 years, the Belknap County Attorney was asked to prosecute the matter to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. The court rejected defendant's argument that the county attorney should have been appointed under either RSA 7:33 (Supp. 2007) or RSA 661:9, III (2008). A reading of the statutes, supported by their respective title and chapter title of &quot;Election; Temporary Vacancies&quot; and &quot;Vacancies Among Public Officers Elected at State Elections,&quot; indicated that they were intended to apply to actual vacancies in office, rather than when a county attorney was unable to prosecute a single case. Next, the court held that RSA 644:4, 1(b) was not overbroad on its face under the First Amendment. It required repeated communications that either occurred at extremely inconvenient hours or contained offensively coarse language; it also required that these repeated communications be made with the purpose to annoy or alarm another. With those restrictions, the scope of RSA 644:4, I(b) was narrowly tailored to the illegal communications sought to be prevented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff trustee, the owner of an apartment building, brought a five-count suit against defendant city in which it alleged claims of negligence, trespass, and private nuisance. A Merrimack (New Hampshire) trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city based on discretionary function immunity. The trustee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the city was entitled to immunity on Count III, in which the trustee alleged that the city's decision not to lower the water in a reservoir was in itself negligent. In making this decision, the city had to weigh competing economic and social factors. This was precisely the type of municipal planning that discretionary function immunity sought to protect. The city was also entitled to immunity on Count I, alleging that it was negligent in failing to construct a second outlet for a dam. This was a planning decision requiring the city to make choices as to the manner in which to construct the dam. The city was not entitled to immunity on Count II, which alleged that the city's failure to clean out debris obstructed the flow of water and damaged the trustee's property. Furthermore, the record did not show that the city had a plan or policy concerning the maintenance of the drainage systems. Finally, the city was not immune from the trespass and nuisance claims because the trustee was alleging that the city's conduct amounted to a physical taking of the property. To hold otherwise would require an expansion of the scope of immunity, rather than limit such immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment as to the counts alleging that the city was negligent in not deciding to lower the water in a reservoir and in failing to construct a second outlet for a lake. It reversed the grant of summary judgment as to other counts. It remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court for the Hillsborough-Southern Judicial District (New Hampshire) upheld the ZBA's decision. The applicant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that because the town had not appealed a 1999 decision in which the ZBA found that the junkyard was a valid nonconforming use, collateral estoppel applied. Therefore, it was established that the junkyard was a valid nonconforming use. Because licensing and zoning were distinct, the applicant's failure to obtain a junkyard license did not divest the junkyard of its status as a nonconforming use. The licensing scheme, which was concerned with the proper operation of junkyards, not uniformity of land use and stability of community growth, was a pure licensing scheme that was not so closely aligned with zoning regulations so as to blur this distinction. Furthermore, RSA 236:125 (1993), governing the licensing process for established junkyards, was applicable in this case. Although the town argued that the applicant had unlawfully expanded his nonconforming use, the court could not ascertain whether the ZBA had made such a determination; thus, remand was required. There was no merit to the applicant's arguments that he was entitled to a license by virtue of the 1999 decision grandfathering his junkyard or that RSA 236:125 required the town to issue him a license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After petitioner filed the present action, paternity testing showed that he was not the child's biological father. The court held that petitioner could maintain an action under RSA ch. 461-A despite not being the child's stepparent, biological parent, or grandparent. Petitioner had alleged sufficient facts to establish his status as a parent. When respondent sought and received child support from petitioner, she necessarily acknowledged his status as the child's parent, and no court had terminated petitioner's child support obligation. Furthermore, no challenge to the affidavit of paternity executed by the parties at the child's birth had been filed. Consequently, petitioner had standing to seek full parental rights and responsibilities. Next, because petitioner had alleged sufficient facts to establish that he was the child's parent, the court presumed that he currently enjoyed rights equal to respondent's to raise and care for the child. Accordingly, the trial court's continued consideration of the parenting petition did not intrude on respondent's fundamental liberty interest under the federal and state constitutions to raise and care for the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners, a landscaping company and its owners, filed an action for declaratory judgment against respondent town, which in turn filed a petition for injunctive relief against petitioners in which it alleged zoning violations. A Rockingham (New Hampshire) court granted injunctive relief to the town. It awarded the town attorney's fees under RSA 676:17, II (Supp. 2007) and denied petitioners' claims for attorney's fees. Petitioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court stated that under the previous version of RSA 676:17, II, which used the words &quot;may recover,&quot; a trial court had the discretion to deny a town's request for fees. By amending the statute to read &quot;shall recover,&quot; however, the legislature had removed such discretion from the trial court. Thus, because the town had prevailed in its enforcement action against petitioners, the trial court was required to award it attorney's fees. There was no merit to petitioners' claim that the award violated their procedural due process rights. A letter sent to petitioners before the town filed its action not only informed petitioners of the possibility that they might have to pay attorney's fees, but also cited the statute upon which the town had authority to request such fees. Moreover, every person was presumed to know the law, and the statute clearly provided for a prevailing town to receive attorney's fees. As for petitioners' request for attorney's fees, this could have been denied by the trial court either because the motion for reconsideration seeking attorney's fees was untimely under N.H. Super. Ct. R. 59-A or because the trial court had rejected petitioners' due process claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After a bench trial in a New Hampshire trial court, defendant was convicted of being in New Hampshire without permission while on probation in another state in violation of RSA 651-A:25, IX (2007). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that the statute was not void for vagueness under the federal Constitution. No one of ordinary intelligence, told to leave New Hampshire because he or she did not have permission to stay, would believe that he or she could return to New Hampshire without permission. Next, the indictment was not insufficient. The statute required probationers or parolees to receive permission from a designated officer if they were in the state past the seven-day window. Thus, it was not necessary that the indictment allege that defendant failed to leave the state within seven days; it only needed to allege that he was in the state without permission more than seven days after he was told to leave. Finally, defendant had not been denied his right to a speedy trial. The record was insufficient to determine what caused the delay. Furthermore, defendant had waited nearly six months from the time the State entered a nolle prosequi and about 10 months from the date of his indictment to raise his claim. The fact that he was incarcerated on other charges as well mitigated any anxiety caused by the delay, and he had not alleged that the delay impaired his defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant offered to pay a couple to engage in sexual intercourse with each other and explained that he would need to watch them. The court held that the statute was not overbroad because the possibility that it might be applied in some unconstitutional manner was exceedingly slight. Furthermore, an overbreadth challenge would rarely succeed against a law not specifically addressed to speech or to conduct that was necessarily associated with speech, such as picketing and demonstrating. RSA 645:2, I(f), specifically targeted conduct, i.e., prostitution, that was neither protected speech nor necessarily associated with speech. Because the statute was not substantially overbroad, any applications of the statute that infringed upon protected conduct could be remedied on a case-by-case basis. Defendant made no &quot;as-applied&quot; challenge, nor did he argue that paying or offering to pay two people to engage in sexual intercourse was constitutionally protected activity. Thus, this was a fact situation to which the sanctions imposed by RSA 645:2 could be constitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff operated halfway houses under contracts with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The court noted that in an earlier appeal, it had held that intermediate scrutiny under the state constitution required that the challenged legislation be substantially related to an important governmental objective. The burden was on the government to show that the legislation met this test. Here, although defendant had concerns that the prisoners would pose some threat to the community, engage in recidivism, or affect property values, it had presented no evidence that these concerns were founded in fact. In contrast, the record contained substantial evidence that the proposed use would provide an important social benefit and not pose any risk to the safety of the neighborhood, including letters from police, community and religious leaders, and law enforcement experts. Next, the trial court properly granted a builder's remedy. It had made detailed findings regarding the reasonableness of the proposed use, including that the property was suitable for a halfway house, that property values would not be adversely affected, and that numerous safety precautions were part of the proposed use.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the homeowners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The appellate court found that the homeowners did not follow the statutory procedure to challenge the permit. The only question raised by the homeowners was whether the permit complied with the ordinance, which was not a question peculiarly suited to judicial treatment or resolution, but was a question routinely resolved by the local zoning board. The homeowners' proper remedy was to appeal to the zoning board. They did not challenge the trial court's ruling that they could have appealed the issuance of the permit within a reasonable time after they discovered that it had been issued, but failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

Ruling on cross motions for summary judgment, the Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire) found for the State and upheld the constitutionality of the 2007 statute. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Under RSA 72:12-a (2003), the company had been granted a property tax exemption for pollution control facilities located at its landfill. RSA 72:12-a, I (Supp. 2007) eliminated the exemption for privately-owned landfills. The company claimed that RSA 72:12-a (Supp. 2007) did not extinguish the exemption granted under RSA 72:12-a (2003). The supreme court held that RSA 72:12-a (Supp. 2007) created a classification of property for tax purposes--landfills, which were not entitled to exemption for pollution control facilities, and other properties, which were--which was sufficiently inclusive to constitute a distinctive class, and that it did so based upon land use. Such distinction was valid under the constitution. Further, RSA 72:12-a, I (Supp. 2007) violated neither the legislature's taxing authority nor equal protection, and the statute extinguished any right to claim an exemption for taxes assessed on or after April 1, 2007, for pollution control facilities located at landfills, regardless of when any exemption determinations had been obtained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant appealed the sentence imposed by the Merrimack County Superior Court (New Hampshire), after a jury convicted him of attempted escape, in violation of RSA 629:1 (2007) and RSA 642:6 (2007), and possessing an implement for escape, in violation of RSA 642:7 (2007). The trial court sentenced him to 10 to 30 years in prison on each indictment, to be served concurrent with each other and consecutive to sentences he was already serving.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant's convictions resulted from his appearance at a judicial proceeding wherein he used a paperclip he found on the floor to cut his shoelace. He used the shoelace to keep the lock on his leg brace open. He attempted to run and was tackled in a hallway by several officers. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court violated his privilege against self-incrimination by considering his failure to participate in the Presentence Investigation (PSI) and his silence at the sentencing hearing as a factor supporting the imposition of a lengthy prison sentence. The court examined various jurisdictions and held that a sentencing court's inference of a lack of remorse from a defendant's silence at sentencing did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination in all instances. The court held that the trial court did not violate defendant's right against self-incrimination because he confessed to committing the acts underlying both crimes and only denied the requisite intent to escape, which did not conflict with any feelings of remorse. The court noted that the trial court considered defendant's lack of involvement with the PSI, not his silence, as a sentencing factor.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant worked as a photographer at a camp for children 15 years old and younger. In that capacity, defendant took certain pictures of the children attending the camp. Defendant gave three CD-ROM discs to the camp director. On one of the discs, the director discovered images depicting heads and necks of minor females superimposed upon naked adult female bodies, with the naked bodies engaging in various sexual acts. No children were depicted as engaging in the sex acts. Defendant told investigating police that the sexually explicit photographs were only his &quot;personal fantasy&quot; and that they were not real. Defendant was indicted for possession of child pornography. He was then convicted on stipulated facts after the trial court declined to find that defendant's possession of the material was constitutionally protected. The state supreme court, limiting its ruling to the circumstances of defendant's case, found that application of the child pornography possession statute,&nbsp;RSA 649-A:3(I)(e) (2007), to defendant's conduct violated defendant's First Amendment free speech rights because the state did not have a compelling interest in regulating the possession of such morphed images.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant employer was permitted an interlocutory appeal to challenge the ruling of the Superior Court (New Hampshire), which declined to grant its motion to dismiss the negligence and wrongful death actions filed by plaintiff, and estate administratrix. The touchstone of the appeal was the constitutionality of the death benefit provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, RSA 281-A:26(IV) (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff's decedent was killed after accidentally being electrocuted within the scope of his employment. He left no dependents. Plaintiff brought the action on behalf of his estate. Defendant's motion to dismiss asserted immunity from tort liability under the exclusivity provision of the Act, RSA 281-A:8 (Supp. 2007), and the death benefit provision of RSA 281-A:26(IV) (1999), which provided a limited remedy to the estates of dependentless decedents who are killed at work and the estates of dependentless decedents who are killed outside of work. The court applied an intermediate level of scrutiny and held that the exclusivity of the death benefit provision did not offend the equal protection guarantee of the New Hampshire Constitution since it served an important government interest and balanced the competing needs of employers and employees. In doing so, the court revisited its decision in Park v. Rockwell International Corp., 121 N.H. 894 (1981) and overruled the same.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the trial court's denial of the employer's motion to dismiss and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings in conformity with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff taxpayer, which provided telecommunications services to residents of defendant city, brought an action against the city in which it challenged certain taxes. On remand, a New Hampshire trial court held that the city's taxation of the taxpayer for its use and occupation of public property under RSA 72:23(I) (Supp. 1993) violated equal protection. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court held that the statute as applied to the taxpayer violated its equal protection rights under N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 2, 10, and 12 and N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 5. The evidence demonstrated that the taxpayer used and occupied the public ways through its pole licenses in a manner indistinguishable from the gas, cable, and electric companies that used and occupied the public ways under other agreements with the city. The city, however, had not imposed a real property tax upon the other utilities' indistinguishable use and occupation of the public ways. Accordingly, the city was selectively applying the statute against the taxpayer. The city had offered no rational reason for doing so, and the record did not indicate that any legitimate governmental interest was furthered by this disparate treatment. Next, to remedy the city's unconstitutional conduct, the trial court properly struck the taxpayer's liability for the relevant years. Merely reducing its payment would perpetuate the unconstitutional scheme, since the taxpayer would still be the only utility using and occupying the public ways to pay a real estate tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to the official ballot town meeting form of government established under the charter, voting residents at the first session of the annual meeting had the power to amend a proposed budget figure. Voting on the budget occurred at the second session of the annual meeting. The budget's ballot question instructed residents to vote for either the school board's budget, the budget committee's budget or, any amended budget figure passed in the first session. That method of adopting the budget was permitted under the statutes. The statutes did not require that the ballot question be limited to one budget figure or that it be framed in a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; question.

The DES hearing officer revoked the corporation's solid waste permit. The corporation appealed a decision of the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services Waste Management Council upholding a hearing officer's decision revoking its solid waste permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The corporation argued that the Council erred in affirming the hearing officer's revocation of its solid waste permit. The supreme court disagreed, finding that the record showed that the DES permit was issued based on false or misleading information. The corporation omitted relevant facts from its permit transfer application, gave the misleading impression that the officers and key employees for the corporation were the same as for the existing permittee, failed to inform DES that the other facility permits were held by a different company with which a convicted felon was involved, and failed to disclose the felony conviction of that person despite a direct inquiry by the DES. The supreme court further concluded that the revocation did not result in an unconstitutionally excessive penalty and the imposition of the statutorily authorized sanction was not an unsustainable exercise of discretion. Finally, contrary to the Sate's contention, the supreme court agreed with the Council that RSA 149-M:9 was intended to cover only those individuals who, at the time of the application, fell within the enumerated categories.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Concord, N.H., Zoning Ordinance art. 28-6-7 (2001) prohibited signs that moved or created an illusion of movement except those parts which solely indicated date, time, or temperature. The trial court found that the commercial speech to be displayed was neither unlawful nor misleading and thus was entitled to First Amendment protection. However, it also found that the city failed to meet its burden to establish that the ordinance advanced the city's asserted interests in aesthetics or public safety. The high court held that the city did not have to provide detailed proof that the ordinance advanced those purported interests; its judgment that prohibiting moving signs containing commercial advertising would enhance the city's aesthetic environment and improve traffic safety was not manifestly unreasonable and should not have been set aside. The ordinance was not broader than necessary to meet and advance the city's substantial interests of traffic safety and aesthetics.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner also claimed that she discovered pile of cigarette butts under the seat of her car, which were the brand that respondent smoked. The appellate court held that the cigarette-butt issue was not mentioned in the stalking petition, and the trial court erred as a matter of law by considering it. The record contained no eyewitness accounts or other direct evidence that respondent entered petitioner's residence after he removed the last of his belongings. The appellate court further held that the parking-lot encounter and the two subsequent telephone calls were not sufficient to support the issuance of a stalking order. The trial court made no factual findings concerning the content of those calls. Thus, the stalking order had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The State of New Hampshire petitioned for a writ of certiorari which challenged a dismissal by a trial court of an indictment against defendant that charged him with falsifying physical evidence, in violation of RSA 641:6 (2007). The trial court had granted defendant's directed verdict motion at the conclusion of the bench trial but prior to a verdict having been rendered, based on improper venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was indicted and after all judges that regularly presided in the county where the crime was allegedly committed recused themselves, the matter was transferred to another county. The trial court granted defendant's directed verdict motion at the close of the case and prior to rendering a verdict. It dismissed the indictment upon finding a violation of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 17 and RSA 602:1 (2001). The trial court denied the State's reconsideration request, and it sought the writ of certiorari. The court granted the writ under RSA 606:10 (2001), noting that the State had no other avenue for review due to the attachment of jeopardy. After reviewing the facts and the history of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 17, the court determined that defendant had waived his constitutional and statutory right to proper venue by failing to timely object thereto. Although it was conceded that jeopardy attached, the directed verdict was not a judgment of acquittal. As none of the material elements under RSA 625:11(III)(e) and (IV) of the criminal offense were decided, the dismissal due to improper venue did not bar a retrial under the Double Jeopardy Clause of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court granted the petition for the writ and vacated the dismissal. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Respondent, the Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, appealed an order of the Superior Court (New Hampshire) denying his motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment to petitioners, an association, five counties, and four county commissioners, in an action for declaratory and injunctive relief concerning the sharing of the cost of providing Medicaid-funded long-term care.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners claimed that the Commissioner violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 28-a, by requiring the counties to pay a share of the cost of providing Medicaid-funded long-term care to recipients of old age assistance (OAA) and assistance for the permanently and totally disabled (APTD) who received services in facilities not licensed by the State as residential care facilities. The state supreme court held that in light of the statutory definitions of &quot;nursing home&quot; in force when the legislature used the term &quot;nursing home&quot; in RSA 167:18-b(I), the legislature did not intend, by using the term &quot;nursing home,&quot; to limit the applicability of RSA 167:18-b(I) to OAA and APTD recipients in institutions licensed by the Department as residential care facilities. The court held that the term &quot;nursing home&quot; meant any institution certified by the federal Medicaid program to provide nursing facility services. The phrase &quot;recipients who are in nursing homes&quot; meant OAA and APTD recipients receiving Medicaid-funded nursing facility services in institutions certified by the Medicaid program to provide such services. Thus, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to petitioners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The trial court's grant of summary judgment to petitioners on their claim that the Department billings violated the state constitution was vacated and remanded for further proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner appealed an order of the Dover District Court, New Hampshire, which affirmed a decision by respondent police chief to revoke petitioner's permit to carry a concealed weapon pursuant to RSA 159:6-b (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner went to the city attorney's office to discuss a lawsuit he had filed. During the conversation, petitioner removed a loaded pistol from his pocket and placed it on the desk as a &quot;prop&quot; in a story he was telling, which involved threats that allegedly had been made upon him by organized crime members. As a result of this incident, the police chief notified petitioner that he had decided to revoke petitioner's license to carry a concealed firearm. Petitioner argued that RSA 159:6-b violated his state constitutional right to substantive due process because it impaired his right under the New Hampshire Constitution to keep and bear arms. The court concluded that RSA 159:6-b was a reasonable limitation upon the state constitutional right to bear arms. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face, nor was it vague as applied to petitioner. Petitioner, who knew the proper procedure for handling a loaded weapon and failed to follow it, had a reasonable opportunity to know that using a loaded gun in a public place to tell a story about organized crime threats was not a proper purpose and could result in the revocation of his concealed carry permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">After respondents began building a home on their lakeshore property, the Department informed them that the construction possibly violated the Shoreland Protection Act because the act prohibited any construction within fifty feet of the shoreline without DES approval. See RSA 483-B:9(II)(b) (Supp. 2006). Respondents continued with the construction without obtaining the needed permits. Respondents argued that the trial court erred in ruling that respondents violated the Act by building their home within 50 feet of the lake without authorization. The state supreme court held that the plain meaning of RSA 483-B:10(I) allowed the Department to impose conditions on any construction of a single-family home on a nonconforming undeveloped lot of record. The right to build a single-family home on a nonconforming undeveloped lot of record, therefore, was not absolute, but was contingent upon conditions that the DES imposed upon the construction. Thus, the trial court did not err when it ruled that respondents violated the statute by building their home within 50 feet of the lake without obtaining approval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was charged with improper influence under RSA 640:3 (2006), and counsel was appointed to represent him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant argued that the recoupment statute was unconstitutional under the substantive due process protections of N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The purpose of RSA 604-A:9 was to require that those who were financially able to do so, pay for a service that they received from the State. There was nothing illegitimate in the governmental interest in recouping costs expended for public defense whether or not a defendant was convicted. Moreover, the statutory scheme was rationally related to that purpose in that it inquired into a defendant's ability to pay and outlined procedures for recoupment order, collection, and appeal of such orders. While federal case law found a rational basis for distinguishing between those convicted and those acquitted, the rational basis did not require the distinction. Since the Fourteenth Amendment offered no greater protection than the state constitution, the recoupment statute was constitutional under both constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Respondent estate challenged a judgment by the Hillsborough-Southern Judicial District (New Hampshire) that approved recommendations by a master to deny its requests for injunctive relief and dollar for dollar credit toward a deceased father's child support obligations based upon payments of Social Security dependency benefits to the children for whom the father was obligated to provide support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Shortly after the trial court approved modifications of the father's child support obligations, the New Hampshire Division of Child Support Services began various actions to collect his ongoing child support obligations and arrearages. It garnished the father's own direct Social Security disability benefits and placed a lien on his checking account. The estate replaced the father as a party after he died. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that the father was obligated to seek modification of his child support obligations under RSA 458-C:2(II) before he was entitled to credit for his children's Social Security dependency benefits. In addition, the children's receipt of the dependency benefits did not diminish the father's arrearages. The trial court did not err by declining to grant the requested relief concerning the garnishment of the father's Social Security benefits. The father was properly notified of the Division's determination of the amount of his arrearages under RSA 161-C:7(III). However, because the trial court did not discuss the statutory exemptions from attachment in RSA 161-C:11, 511:2(XVIII), it erred in denying the estate's request for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner residential childcare providers filed petitions for writ of certiorari under N.H. Sup. Ct. R. 11, challenging decisions by two panels of the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS); the providers claimed, inter alia, that panels should have ordered retroactive application of the recalculated rates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The hearing panels found that the New Hampshire Division for Children, Youth &amp; Families (DCYF) erred by simply carrying forward the prior rates instead of calculating new ones and directed DCYF to recalculate the rate for each provider. The panels further concluded that the revised rates should have become effective at the beginning of the year. However, the panels determined that they did not have the legal authority to order DCYF to make retroactive payments at the recalculated rate levels. The state supreme court found that establishing the actual residential rate for the childcare providers and determining when the rate became effective fell within the jurisdiction that the legislature conferred upon the hearing panels in RSA 170-G:4-a(I) and N.H. Code Admin. R. Ann. He.-C 6422.22, 6422.24, 6422.25. However, the hearing panels lacked authority to order DHHS to make retroactive payments at the recalculated rate levels even though the providers were entitled to it. The panels also lacked authority to order DCYF to devise a reasonable priority or classification system to facilitate distribution of available funds to the providers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The decisions were affirmed insofar as they determined the correct residential rates, concluded that the rates took effect at the beginning of the respective fiscal years, and recognized that the panels lacked the authority to order DHHS to make retroactive payments; the decisions were reversed insofar as they ordered DCYF to devise a reasonable priority or classification system to facilitate distribution of available funds.</SPAN></P>

The owner appealed an order of the Superior Court (New Hampshire) denying its motion for summary judgment and granting the cross-motion for summary judgment filed by the residents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The owner sought to build a private, 3.1-mile automobile racetrack. The development site was located directly over primary and secondary recharge areas for an aquifer which provided drinking water for a number of towns. The owner argued that the trial court erred as a matter of law by interpreting the WCO as being more stringent than the federal and state wetlands permit review. The appellate court held that the WCO unambiguously stated that if provisions of the WCO conflicted with and were less stringent than comparable provisions in state or federal regulations, the more stringent provisions had to be satisfied to obtain a special use permit. Nothing in the WCO eliminated the requirement to obtain a special use permit when provisions from state or federal regulations were more stringent. Thus, the trial court correctly ruled that the residents were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law regarding the WCO's application to the construction project. The owner also argued that the factors listed in the WCO were unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court found that the owner failed to articulate what language it found vague, which was fatal to its argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The club operated a shooting range for many years, even though the operation was illegal because it involved uses that were not permitted. The legislature later enacted a statute that made it unlawful to retroactively apply a rule, statute, or ordinance to the scope of activities previously conducted at the shooting range if the shooting range was in operation prior to enactment of the rule, statute, or ordinance. The town planning board then considered the club's application for site plan approval, but concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the application. The trial court found that RSA 159-B:4 divested the town planning board of jurisdiction over the club's site plan application. However, the trial court also found that RSA ch. 159-B was unconstitutional, enjoined all shooting activities at the club, and remanded the matter to the town planning board. On appeal, the state supreme court found that it was unnecessary to determine whether the statute was constitutional because the club's operation of the shooting range was illegal prior to statute's enactment and, thus, club's operation of the shooting range for many years prior to the statutory enactment was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendants were charged with driving while under the influence (DWI). The State appealed a ruling of the Portsmouth District Court (New Hampshire) that a sobriety checkpoint operated by the Portsmouth Police Department (PPD) was unconstitutional, suppressing evidence collected at the checkpoint, and dismissing charges of DWI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The State argued that the trial court erred by failing to perform the balancing test established in State v. Koppel, and by treating the fact that the PPD issued its press release one day before the sobriety checkpoint as dispositive of the question of the checkpoint's validity. The failure to perform the Koppel test was not error, as the legislature gave the superior court the responsibility, in the first instance, of performing the Koppel test by establishing a procedure, in RSA 265:1-a (2004), for the superior court to determine whether a particular sobriety checkpoint was permissible under the New Hampshire Constitution. The trial court's imposition upon the PPD of the obligation to provide &quot;aggressive advance notice to the public&quot; was error, as such notice was not a constitutional requirement. The PPD did provide advanced notice of it checkpoint, which consisted precisely of what the PPD promised in its petition: a detailed press release distributed to many press agencies. The fact that it was released only one day before the checkpoints did not render the checkpoints constitutionally defective, nor did the fact that only one media outlet decided to print the press release.</SPAN></P>

The state's highest court held that the statute provided ample notice of the objects it proscribed. The use of &quot;customarily&quot; presented an evidentiary question, rather than a constitutional validity question. Section 318-B:1(X-a)(a)-(k) contained a nonexhaustive list of items that could be considered drug paraphernalia, including items defendant was indicted for selling. The terms &quot;intended for use&quot; and &quot;customarily intended for use&quot; did not permit a person to be found criminally liable based on the intentions of another. The statute did not authorize or encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague under the State or Federal Constitutions. The items were not contraband under federal law from the time they were manufactured. Defendant was acquitted of all pending charges. The State ordered defendant not to sell six specific categories of items. The State had to return the items to defendant as the State prosecuted defendant for items virtually indistinguishable from many of the items it returned to defendant after the first prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The owner sought the permit to rebuild her nonconforming shed, which was damaged by a storm. On appeal, the zoning board and the owner argued that the provision at issue, Eaton, N.H., Zoning Ordinance art. VI, &sect; 2, did not apply to the shed because N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 674:19 (1996) prohibited the application of new zoning ordinances to existing buildings. The appellate court found that this issue was not preserved for review. Eaton, N.H., Zoning Ordinance art. VI, &sect; 2 worked to reduce nonconforming uses by establishing a time limit on their reconstruction. Those nonconforming uses not reestablished within a year were lost. Thus, the provision reduced the chance that a nonconforming use would have been rebuilt. A legitimate purpose of zoning was the reduction and elimination of nonconforming uses, and so the ordinance's purpose of reducing nonconforming uses was a legitimate governmental interest. As applied to the owner's property, the ordinance provision had a rational relationship to the legitimate goal of reducing nonconforming uses. The ordinance did not violate substantive due process as applied to the shed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant city appealed the orders of the Superior Court (New Hampshire), which reversed the decision of the city's Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) and remanded plaintiff applicant's case to the ZBA with instructions to grant a variance to the applicant. The applicant had applied for a building permit to operate a halfway house. The ZBA had denied the request upon concluding that the halfway house constituted a correctional facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">A correctional facility was not a permitted use in any of the city's zoning districts. The court determined that the certified record did not reasonably support the trial court's determination that the applicant met its burden with respect to establishing the first prong of the case law standard with regard to establishing unnecessary hardship when seeking a variance. The court found that there was no evidence that demonstrated how the size and layout of the specific building proposed made the property particularly appropriate for the proposed use, no evidence demonstrated that the proposed site was unique, nor did the evidence reasonably support the trial court's conclusion that the applicant's property was burdened by the restriction in a manner that was distinct from similarly situated property. The court clarified that the intermediate scrutiny level of review to challenge an ordinance's constitutionality required that the challenged legislation be substantially related to an important governmental objective, with the burden being on the government to demonstrate that the challenged legislation met that test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant appealed a decision of the Strafford Superior Court (New Hampshire), which entered a judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of felonious sexual assault with a person thirteen years of age or older but less than 16 years of age (statutory rape), under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 632-A:3(II) (Supp. 2006), as amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it ruled that the State did not have to prove that he knew that the victim was under the age of legal consent. The court invited the court to overrule prior precedent holding that statutory rape was a strict liability crime in that an accused could not assert as a legal defense that he did not know that the victim was under the age of legal consent when penetration occurred. On review, the court affirmed under the doctrine of stare decisis. Although the legislature had amended the statute several times, it did not insert a mens rea or provide a reasonable mistake of age defense. Developments in the law or changed circumstances did not change the analysis because the statutory rape laws were designed to impose the risk of criminal penalty on the adult.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 651:2, 632-A:10-a, and 651:3 did not authorize consecutive sentences, the court found that by the repeal of former N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 651:3(III), the legislature demonstrated its intent to revive the common law authority for judges to impose consecutive sentences. The court further found that the challenged provisions did not violate due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15 because of vagueness in that a person of ordinary intelligence was put on notice that a person guilty of aggravated felonious sexual assault might receive the maximum statutory sentence for each conviction. The court also found that sentencing scheme did not violate N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 18 because the provision required only that a trial court consider all of the relevant factors necessary to exercise its discretion. N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37 was not violated because the legislature had not circumscribed the trial court's common law authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner property owner appealed an order of the Superior Court, Strafford (New Hampshire), which affirmed a determination by respondent, the New Hampshire State Building Code Review Board, that nine properties of the owner did not qualify as two-family dwellings under the State Fire Code, N.H. Code Admin. R. Ann. Saf.-C 6008.01. The owner claimed that the Board improperly determined that subsequently enacted regulations applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The owner contended that the reclassification of his property imposed an incompatible requirement on a pre-existing use, resulted in an unconstitutional retrospective application, and improperly denied him his vested property rights under N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 23, 12. On review, the court upheld the trial court's order under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 155-A:12(II). The application of the code to protect the health and safety of the community was not unconstitutional retrospective legislation. Further, the owner did not have a vested right to a continued classification as a two-family dwelling for the purposes of fire code application. The interpretation of NFPA 1 Fire Prevention Code, 1-9.2, adopted by N.H. Code Admin. R. Ann. Saf.-C 6008.01, was consistent with the language of the regulation and with the purpose under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 153:5. That regulation did not exempt preexisting, occupied buildings from compliance with code provisions applicable to existing buildings. Further, the restriction did not involve a fundamental right in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and was rationally related to permissible state objectives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff parent corporation filed a suit against defendant New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration in which plaintiff challenged the amount of business profits tax (BPT) it had paid under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 77-A:4(IV) (2003). It claimed that the statute violated the Commerce Clause. The Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire) granted defendant's motions to dismiss for lack of standing and for summary judgment. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Under the statute, a parent corporation could take a deduction for dividends received from its corporate subsidiaries when the gross business profits of the subsidiaries had already been subject to tax in New Hampshire. The Department denied plaintiff's requests to use this deduction for dividends it received from its foreign subsidiaries because they did not transact business in New Hampshire and thus had not been taxed there. The court held that it was error to dismiss the suit for lack of standing. Any corporate parent that paid BPT in New Hampshire but was ineligible for the dividend-received deduction in &sect; 77-A:4(IV) was a proper party to bring suit for a determination of whether the basis upon which it was ineligible was constitutionally permissible. Next, the statute did not facially discriminate against foreign commerce. A unitary business with a foreign subsidiary operating in New Hampshire and a unitary business with a foreign subsidiary not operating in New Hampshire were each only taxed once. Thus, there was no differential treatment; the latter was not taxed more heavily than the former; and the former was not given a direct commercial advantage over the latter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the grant of the motion to dismiss. It affirmed the grant of the motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff testified that defendant began stalking her after she had the boyfriend arrested. The court first held that &sect; 633:3-a was not vague in violation of the Due Process Clause or N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15. The phrase &quot;legitimate purpose,&quot; read with the rest of the statute, did not require a person of common intelligence to guess at its meaning. Next, although defendant claimed that the boyfriend had hired him as a licensed private detective to conduct surveillance of plaintiff, defendant had refused to testify why he was hired. Thus, he had failed to show that the purpose for which he was hired was lawful. The evidence was sufficient to support the entry of the final order. There was evidence that defendant followed, approached, or confronted plaintiff two or more times over a period that evidenced a continuity of purpose and that defendant's conduct, which included &quot;staring down&quot; plaintiff, would have caused a reasonable person to fear for her personal safety. Finally, the fact that the trial judge had recused himself from cases involving the boyfriend did not mean that he should have recused himself when he learned that defendant was the boyfriend's business partner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiffs, minor political parties and a coalition, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Merrimack (New Hampshire), which granted the State's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' petition for a declaration that certain state election laws were unconstitutional because the statutes violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 11 and associational rights under N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 22, 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiffs argued that the following statutes limited the access of minor parties, their candidates, and independent candidates to the general election ballot: N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 655:35 (1996), 655:19-c, 655:40, 655:40-a, and &sect; 655:42 (Supp. 2005) (election laws). In applying the Akins balancing test, the court found that the signature requirements, ranging from 150 to 3,000 for nomination of an independent candidate to three percent of the total votes cast at the last state general election to nominate by nomination papers a political organization, and the threshold required for party status - four percent of the votes cast for the offices of governor or United States Senator - did not impose a severe burden upon associational rights. Thus, the election laws were nondiscriminatory. The State's interests in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization's candidate on the ballot to avoid voter confusion was sufficient to justify the restrictions imposed. The same reasoning applied to plaintiffs' equal protection claims.</SPAN></P>

Next, the supreme court concluded that the decision did not violate N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 5, because DES did not apply N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72:12-a (2003) in a manner which was unjust, unreasonable, or unlawful. Although the raising of tax revenue to aid a particular utility would violate N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 10, tax exemptions do not. The supreme court also rejected the town's argument that DES' decision not to conduct its evaluation of the operator's application as an adjudicative proceeding contravened the Administrative Procedure Act and N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 72:12-a, DES's administrative rules, and the Due Process Clause of the New Hampshire Constitution because the town was not a &quot;party&quot; to the proceedings before DES and thus, the case was not contested as argued by the town.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was indicted for violating N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-B:16 (2004) by maintaining a house resorted to by &quot;drug-dependent persons&quot; to use drugs. She moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that under the New Hampshire and U.S. Constitutions, &sect; 318-B:16 was vague facially and as applied and overbroad, and that the indictment failed to state an offense. The Grafton Superior Court (New Hampshire) denied the motions; defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant argued the phrase &quot;drug-dependent person&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. The high court disagreed. Section 318-B:16, read with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-B:1(X) (2004) (defining &quot;drug-dependent person&quot;), gave clear notice to one of ordinary intelligence of the precise conduct, involving drug-dependent persons, that constituted the nuisance, and thus was not facially vague. Section 318-B:16 gave her adequate warning of what actions were proscribed and thus was not void for vagueness as applied to her. It was not overbroad, as it provided sufficient guidelines to avoid the risk of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. The vagueness analysis was the same under both the New Hampshire and U.S. Constitutions. Section 318-B:16 was not overbroad under the U.S. Constitution as it did not prohibit a substantial amount of protected associational activities. Neither the Fourth Amendment nor N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 19 authorized knowingly keeping a place where drug-dependent persons could use drugs. Listing the names of the drug-dependent persons in the indictment was neither required by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 318-B:16 nor necessary to defendant's preparation for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The State challenged a decision of the Superior Court, Hillsborough-southern judicial district (New Hampshire), finding that it had failed to fulfill its duty to define a constitutionally adequate education, failed to determine the cost of an adequate education, and failed to satisfy the requirement of accountability, and that H.B. 616 (the current education funding law) created a non-uniform tax rate in violation of N.H. Const. pt. 2, art. 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The State argued that it had defined a constitutionally adequate education in N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 193-E:2 (Supp. 2005). The supreme court found that standing alone, &sect; 193-E:2 did not fulfill the State's duty to define the substantive content of a constitutionally adequate education in the context of N.H. Const. pt. 2, art. 83 in such a manner that the citizens of the state could know what the parameters of that educational program were. H.B. 616 standing alone did not necessarily need to contain such a definition for the bill itself to pass constitutional muster. Viewed together, however, the current education funding and &quot;definitional&quot; statutory framework fell well short of the constitutional requirements established in the court's Claremont decisions. If the statutory scheme that was in place provided for more than constitutional adequacy, then the State had yet to isolate what parts of the scheme comprised constitutional adequacy. More specifically, under the statutory scheme there was no way a citizen or a school district could determine the distinct substantive content of a constitutionally adequate education.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The trial court's finding that the State failed to define a constitutionally adequate education was affirmed. That portion of the case containing the trial court's findings that the legislature failed to determine the cost, failed to satisfy the requirement of accountability, and established a non-uniform tax rate was stayed. As to the core definitional issues, the court retained jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The cases were consolidated. After a bench trial, the Rockingham (New Hampshire) trial court awarded plaintiff damages, including $2,190,544 in enhanced compensatory damages. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant had been convicted of the first-degree murder of the decedent. The court held that the trial court properly found that the conviction collaterally estopped defendant from arguing that he had not murdered the decedent. Defendant's decision not to testify at the murder trial had not deprived him of a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues there. The court rejected defendant's argument that the conviction had no preclusive effect because a witness had recanted his testimony. The recantation argument had been raised and rejected on direct appeal and in habeas petitions. Unless and until the conviction was overturned, it was entitled to preclusive effect. Next, the trial court properly awarded enhanced compensatory damages. The murder, as a matter of law, was wanton, malicious, and oppressive and thus justified the award. The amount of the award was not excessive, given defendant's cruelty to the decedent, culminating in the murder. Finally, defendant was not entitled to the homestead exemption of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 480:1. As defendant's sentence was for life without parole, his absence from home was not temporary; moreover, the homestead had been sold.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The candidates argued that the arrangement of parties and candidates established by N.H. Rev. Stat.

The trial court found that first position on a ballot conferred an advantage, and this finding was not appealed. By establishing a system that granted the primacy effect to the party that received the most votes in the prior election, candidates of minority parties were denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the advantages of the primacy effect, and, thus, an equal right to be elected. The ordering of candidates in alphabetical order similarly deprived candidates whose surnames did not begin with letters near the beginning of the alphabet the equal right to be elected. Neither restriction survived strict scrutiny, and that both were thus unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The administrative hearing committee (AHC) for the New Hampshire Department of Employment Security (DES) ordered petitioner corporation to pay unemployment compensation contribution payments that were recalculated on a retroactive basis. The DES appellate board affirmed the AHC's order. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">In January 2001, DES issued a determination of liability to a limited liability company (LLC). The corporation then transferred its bus drivers to the LLC, and the corporation contracted with the LLC for the drivers to operate the corporation's buses. In September 2003, DES determined that the LLC bus drivers were actually employees of the corporation. It transferred the taxes paid by the LLC into the corporation's account and recalculated the corporation's contribution based upon the corporation's higher rate. The court held that the 2001 determination was final and conclusive under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 282-A:95 (1999). The DES had sufficient information before it as to the relationship between the two entities to properly assess the contribution liabilities of the LLC under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 282-A:94 (1999). The court rejected the DES's argument that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 282-A:101(1999) justified its action. That provision authorized DES to look back to the last completed calendar year and void an entity's account. As for N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 282-A:145 (1999), it was merely a procedural statute defining the limitations period within which DES could bring an action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff married couples filed an action against defendant Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services alleging that a portion of the money paid to obtain marriage licenses was a tax that violated N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12 and N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 5. The Superior Court, Hillsborough-northern judicial district (New Hampshire) granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner. The couples appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The couples argued that the trial court erred in granting the Commissioner's motion for summary judgment. The couples argued that the $ 38 of the $ 45 paid for a marriage license that was allocated to a special fund for domestic violence programs was unconstitutional because it was not related to the cost of issuing a marriage license or to the regulation of marriages. The supreme court failed to find that the trial court's ruling that the funds were related to the cost of issuing the license was erroneous; the affidavit of the registrar of vital records indicated that the cost to the State of issuing and record-keeping for each marriage license was approximately $ 40.44. The supreme court thus held that the trial court properly ruled that the $ 38 charge was a fee, not a tax, because the uncontested evidence demonstrated that the charges bore a reasonable relationship to, and approximated the expenses of, issuing the plaintiffs' marriage licenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff developer's application for a variance was denied by a town zoning board of adjustment. The developer's petition for rehearing was denied. Defendant town appealed a declaratory judgment entered upon the developer's petition by the Superior Court (New Hampshire) holding that Strafford, N.H., Zoning &amp; Land Use Ordinances, Subdivision Regs., Non-Residential Site Plan Regs., &amp; Bldg. Regs. ch. 1, &sect; 4.1(F) (2003) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The town argued that the wrong standard was applied. The state's highest court could not determine what standard was applied. On appeal, the developer claimed that &sect; 4.1(F) violated its substantive due process rights. Thus, a rational basis review was to be conducted. The trial court's order invalidated the ordinance because the setback requirements could have been more narrowly tailored, which was an improper application of the strict scrutiny test. The rational basis test required that legislation be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. It did not require inquiry into whether legislation unduly restricted individual rights. A least-restrictive-means analysis was not part of the test. Metzger v. Brentwood, 374 A.2d 954 (N.H. 1977), and Powers v. Hampton, 480 A.2d 143 (N.H. 1984), were overruled. Legislation could not be applied in a case if it was facially invalid and could not constitutionally be applied in any case. Thus, the developer had to show that &sect;&nbsp;4.1(F) was not rationally related to its purpose of protecting the wetlands. It was noted that any fair reason that could be stated for bringing &sect;&nbsp;4.1(F) within the town's purview might save it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court first held that the Act provided the criteria that DES had to follow in issuing permits and that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 481:1 (2001) imposed no specific additional test that DES had to apply. Next, the proposed groundwater withdrawal was not subject to the permitting requirements of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 482-A:3 (Supp. 2005), referring to fill and dredge in wetlands; thus, DES was not required to hold a public hearing under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 482-A:11(IV) (2001). Granting the permit was not a taking because the right of user of groundwater was not a protected property interest. The fact that the town was entitled to notice and to submit comments under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 485-C:21 (2001) did not make it a party entitled to an adjudicative hearing in a contested case under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 541-A:1(IV) (1997). Next, though &quot;need&quot; was not defined in the Act, the dictionary definition of &quot;need&quot; was &quot;requisite, desirable, or useful.&quot; DES could have reasonably concluded that the description of need complied with N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 485-C:4(XII)(b) (2001) and N.H. Code Admin. R. Ann. Env.-Ws 388.05. Finally, DES had not failed to follow its own rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff owner appealed a decision by the Superior Court, Hillsborough-Northern Judicial District, (New Hampshire) that upheld the validity of an interim growth management ordinance adopted by defendant town; the owner claimed, inter alia, that the ordinance was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The town adopted an interim growth management ordinance that prohibited the zoning and planning boards from formally accepting or acting upon any site plan applications creating a total of more than three lots for a one-year period. In response, the owner brought a petition for declaratory judgment, bill in equity, and request for a preliminary and permanent injunction, alleging that the ordinance was illegal, unconstitutional, and void both facially and as applied. The owner argued that the ordinance was an ultra vires enactment in derogation of the putatively superseding &quot;rights&quot; prescribed in N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 676:4 (Supp. 2005), 676:12 (Supp. 2005). The state supreme court found that the owner's statutory interpretation would render N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 674:23 rather meaningless. The town's ordinance, enacted pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 674:23(I) (Supp. 2003) and in accordance with the decision in Conway, was valid, and not ultra vires. Because it was unclear from the record whether the owner's constitutional claim was withdrawn or deferred, the matter would be remanded to the trial court for further action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Section 402-C:40(I) allowed third parties asserting claims against an insured of a liquidated insurer to file claims with the Commissioner, but conditioned such filing on their releasing the insured from a certain degree of liability on the claim. The estates argued that this infringed on claimants' constitutional right to the redress of actionable injuries under N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 14. The high court held that &sect; 402-C:40(I) did not violate the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions as the condition it imposed was germane to the legitimate objectives of the statute and any burden on the rights of potential third party claimants was not unreasonable or arbitrary. Section 402-C:40(I) did not violate equal protection (N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 2, 12) because third party claimants maintained the right to pursue their claims against their defendants, regardless of whether those defendants were insured by an insurer in liquidation. Section 402-C:40(I) and the proof of claim form signed by the third party claimant provided notice that the filing of a claim would release the insured of liability up to the applicable policy limits, thereby satisfying any due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant moved to dismiss a complaint charging her with simple assault, contending that N.H. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Testimony showed that defendant shoved her former boyfriend's attorney with enough force to move her body backwards. Defendant argued that the undefined phrase, &quot;unprivileged physical contact,&quot; which &sect; 631:2-a(I)(a) criminalized, was unconstitutionally vague. The high court initially held that deficiencies in defendant's briefing did not preclude review of her claims. As to the merits, the plain meaning of &quot;unprivileged physical contact&quot; included all physical contact not justified by law or consent. This construction of &sect; 631:2-a(I)(a) adequately limited police discretion so as to make it unlikely that the law would be applied in an ad hoc and subjective manner. Therefore, &sect; 631:2-a(I)(a) did not violate the Due Process Clause. As defendant conceded engaging in physical contact with the victim, and the record contained testimony that she acted knowingly and that her conduct was not justified by law or consent, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that she committed simple assault under &sect; 631:2-a(I)(a) by knowingly causing unprivileged physical contact to the victim by knowingly pushing her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant appealed an order of the Strafford Superior Court (New Hampshire), which dismissed without a hearing defendant's motion to suspend a portion of his sentence. Defendant had been sentenced to three-and-one-half to seven years on each of five convictions for sexual assault. All five sentences were to run consecutively, but the fourth and fifth sentences were suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">On the third sentence, the trial court had recommended that defendant participate in a sexual offender program, indicating that two-and-a-half years of the minimum sentence could be suspended upon successful completion of the program. The trial court indicated that defendant would have to petition the court for such a suspension. However, when defendant attempted to do so, the State objected, arguing that he was not entitled to the relief in light of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 651:20 (Supp. 2005). The supreme court affirmed, noting that the trial court acted outside its statutory grant of authority by proposing to make defendant eligible for sentence suspension at a time that contravened the time limitations in &sect; 651:20. Those time limits were mandatory and could not be waived. Further, the time limitations applied to each of defendant's sentences individually. Finally, the trial court's reinterpretation of its ability to suspend sentences under &sect; 651:20 did not constitute a judicial ex post facto decision and did not violate due process under either the U.S. Constitution or the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">A review of the record confirmed that the parties were domiciled in New Hampshire when the divorce action was commenced, and had been so for at least three years. As such, the trial court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter jurisdiction over the cause for divorce. Since the parties had been domiciled in New Hampshire for at least three years when the divorce action was commenced, the Lebanese divorce decree proffered by the husband could have no force or effect in New Hampshire under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 459:1 (2004), regardless of its validity in Lebanon. As such, the trial court did not err when it refused to dismiss the divorce petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Also, the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of the divorce pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 458:5 and 458:6 (2004) because the wife would be subjected to considerable hardship in seeking relief in a divorce proceeding in Lebanon. Finally, the trial court did not engage in an unsustainable exercise of discretion by declining to defer to the jurisdiction of a Lebanese court as a matter of comity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners, the Associated Press and other news organizations, appealed the order of the Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire), which denied their petition for a declaration that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 458:15-b (2004) was unconstitutional and for an injunction enjoining its enforcement. Petitioners had filed suit against the State seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners asserted that &sect; 458:15-b was unconstitutional because it violated the public's right of access to court records guaranteed by N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 8 and 22, it was an impermissible prior restraint on freedom of speech, and it violated the separation of powers guaranteed by N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 37. The court upheld the lower court decision with regard to subsections (I) and (II) of &sect; 458:15-b as constitutional. The court held, however, that subsection (III) was an unconstitutional restriction on the public right of access to court records provided by N.H. Const. pt. I, arts. 8 and 22.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court affirmed the order of the lower court, in part, with regard to two subsections of the statute.

The court remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff corporation and defendant town sought review of the decisions entered by the Merrimack Superior Court (New Hampshire), which, among other things, vacated a cease and desist order entered by the town regarding the corporation's co-generation facility, dismissed the corporation's takings claim, and dismissed the corporation's claim for attorney's fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">A variance had been granted by the town zoning board of appeals (ZBA) in 1983 to the corporation to operate its co-generation facility, which would use woodchips as fuel. A building permit was granted in 2001, and the relevant state agency issued a Title V permit allowing the corporation to use 100% construction and demolition (C &amp; D) woodchips. The town subsequently issued a cease and desist order, finding that a change of use had occurred. On appeal, the court determined that the town had improperly issued the cease and desist order because the field of air quality control had been preempted by state legislation, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 125-C. Because the ZBA did not impose a condition upon the source or nature of the woodchips, the use of C &amp; D woodchips did not substantially change the purpose of the original use permitted by the 1983 variance. No unconstitutional taking occurred because the town did not permanently restrict the corporation from the use of its property. However, the trial court improperly dismissed the corporation's request for attorney's fees and costs under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 676:17-a(VII) (Supp. 2005) because the cease and desist order was vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court reversed the decision not to grant the corporation attorney's fees and costs and remanded for further proceedings on that issue; the court otherwise affirmed the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant juvenile appealed an order of the Rochester District Court (New Hampshire) which sentenced him to a suspended term. He argued that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-B:19(III-c) (Supp. 2005) was unconstitutional as it subjected him to double jeopardy and the trial court erred in imposing a suspended sentence because N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 628:1 (Supp. 2005) precluded holding him criminally responsible for an act he committed when he was 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">At the age of 17, the juvenile was charged with delinquency and aggravated felonious sexual assault, which he allegedly committed at the age of 12. Following an adjudicatory hearing, the trial court found the juvenile petition &quot;true.&quot; After a hearing, the court sentenced him to a suspended jail term of 12 to 18 months. The appellate court noted that a juvenile who requested a hearing under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 169-B:19(III-c) was not transferred to a court of general criminal jurisdiction. Pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 628:1(I), a juvenile who committed an offense when he was 12 could be found to be a juvenile delinquent. To be held criminally responsible for aggravated felonious sexual assault was to be treated as an adult. To be tried in superior court after an indictment and subject to the full range of criminal penalties for that offense. The juvenile was afforded all the protections that attend juvenile proceedings, including confidentiality of the proceedings and the closing of his case once he became 21. The adjudication of &quot;true&quot; was not equivalent to a finding of guilt in a criminal proceeding. Accordingly, there was no violation of &sect; 628:1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioner mother and intervenor, the maternal grandmother, appealed the final decree of the Sullivan Superior Court (New Hampshire), which awarded custody of a minor child, a daughter, to respondent father. The mother had filed a petition alleging abuse and neglect against the father and his wife. The grandmother subsequently intervened in the custody dispute that ensured between the parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The mother and father had never wed. The daughter was the result of a one-time sexual encounter with the mother and father. The father's paternity was eventually established, though the father had no involvement with the daughter the first five years of her life. During that time, the daughter lived with the grandmother, who had participated extensively in the daughter's life by taking her to doctor's appointments, contributing to her educational and extracurricular activities, and handling the child's day-to-day care. The final decree of the trial court granted legal custody to the mother and father, but not the grandmother, and gave primary physical custody to the father with supervised visitation to the mother due to the mother's drug addiction problems. The court held that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 458:17 (2004) applied to custody disputes between unwed parents and that it was not impossible to grant custody to the grandmother. However, the court found that the trial court failed to address several factors as to whether the grandmother had proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that she should have obtained custody of the daughter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The court vacated the final decree and remanded the case to the trial court for it to determine whether the grandmother's parent-child relationship with the daughter was so significant that a change in custody would emotionally harm the daughter and whether the father significantly failed to accept his parental responsibilities, thus leaving the daughter to have been raised by the grandmother as well as the mother.</SPAN></P>

The representative employee did not challenge the characterization as based on an unconstitutionally vague statutory provision until review of the initial Department decision by its appellate board. The court held that under those circumstances, the employee had not preserved the issue for appellate review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Plaintiff water utilities appealed a New Hampshire Superior Court, Hillsborough-southern judicial district, grant of defendant city's motion for summary judgment declaring that its proceeding to acquire the utilities under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 38:1-:13 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2005) did not constitute a per se inverse condemnation and that the city had not delayed the process for an unreasonable time, and that the proceeding was not barred by laches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The city commenced N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 38 acquisition proceedings when it feared the utilities were going to merge with an out-of-state conglomerate. The parties negotiated for two months, after which the utilities withdrew from discussions. The city sought to resolve issues of price for more than a year before it finally moved forward with the acquisition. The court held that no unconstitutional inverse condemnation resulted from the delay in acting, because the utilities remained free to earn returns for their investors throughout that time. Furthermore, there was no failure to act within a reasonable time because the complexity of the negotiations fully justified a 14-month delay. Finally, there was no showing of prejudice or extraordinary or compelling circumstances that warranted application of principles of laches against the city.</SPAN></P>

The school district claimed that the arbitrary and unreasonable classifications under the statute violated the equal protection provisions of N.H. Const. pt. 1, arts. 1, 14. The state supreme court held that the legislature's rationale for conferring upon the building industry a limited period of time in which a claim could be brought was reasonable, not arbitrary, and bore a fair and substantial relationship to the legislative purpose.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">A New Hampshire superior court issued an order suspending two and one-half years of defendant's witness tampering sentence. The State filed a petition for writ of certiorari, arguing that the trial court lacked authority under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 651:20(I) to suspend the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant's first petition to suspend his sentence was denied about four months after he filed it, but the trial court granted him leave to refile after approximately 23 more months elapsed. About 21 months later, defendant refiled his petition; the trial court granted the petition and denied the State's motion for reconsideration. The State sought review. Defendant argued that the State's petition for writ of certiorari was untimely. The supreme court held that, given the State's short delay in filing its motion for reconsideration, which was caused by confusion created by an error of the trial court, the State demonstrated good cause to suspend the time limits for filing its petition. It rejected defendant's argument that the State should have appealed the order granting defendant leave to refile his petition within 23 months; the issue was not ripe for review until defendant actually refiled his petition. It agreed with the State that the trial court lacked authority under &sect; 651:20(I)(a) to hear the petition to suspend because three years had not elapsed since the filing of his last petition. Under &sect; 651:20(I)(d), the trial court was obliged to dismiss the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">When the board denied the owner's motion for rehearing, it found, inter alia, a new dispositive ground for the denial that was not included in the first denial, specifically that the owner failed to submit a &quot;Standard Release Form for Protective Well Radii&quot; with her application. The trial court held that the owner was procedurally obligated to file a second motion for rehearing challenging the board's consideration reliance on the additional reason for its underlying decision in denying the motion for rehearing. The appellate court found that when the board voted to deny the owner's motion for rehearing, the 30-day appeal period of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 677:4 began to run. A literal interpretation of the statutes would have required a simultaneous judicial appeal and a second motion for rehearing, leading to the absurd result of a single variance matter to be simultaneously pending before two different tribunals: the superior court and the board. Therefore, when the board denied the owner's motion for rehearing, the owner was not required to file a second motion for rehearing to preserve for appeal any new issues, findings, or rulings first raised by the board's denial order.</SPAN></P>

The dealership filed an application for a variance. After the matter eventually went to the appellate court, the variance was granted. The dealership subsequent sought a declaration that &sect; 300:14(b) was unconstitutional and requested damages for the time during which the dealership owned the property but could not use it for vehicular sales. The trial court found that the town primarily focused on aesthetics, safety and planning concerns when drafting and enacting the 1,000-foot buffer between vehicular dealerships. The appellate court held those were legitimate reasons for which a town could exercise its zoning power. The ordinance was rationally related to legitimate town goals and, therefore, comported with the due process requirements of the New Hampshire Constitution. The classification created by the ordinance bore a fair and substantial relationship to the town's goals of preserving aesthetics and ensuring traffic safety.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners, cities and mayors, filed suit against respondents, the New Hampshire Senate President and the House Speaker, to have 2004 N.H. Laws ch. 200 declared unconstitutional on grounds that, inter alia, it was a &quot;money bill&quot; that should have originated in the New Hampshire House of Representatives pursuant to the Origination Clause, N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 18. The New Hampshire superior court denied the petition; petitioners sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Petitioners argued that, as well as violating N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 18 by originating in the New Hampshire Senate, 2004 N.H. Laws ch. 200 (the statute) was materially different from the bill that the legislature had passed and thus violated N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 2, 20, 37 and 44 and N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:8 and 20:2-a. The high court disagreed with both contentions. It initially held that whether the statute violated &sect;&sect; 14:8 and 20:2-a was a nonjusticiable political question, but whether it violated the mandatory provisions of N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 2, 20, 37, and 44 was justiciable. As the statute raised the education property tax rate, it was a &quot;money bill.&quot; However, since House members made up a majority of the conference committee, which added the &quot;money bill&quot; elements to the statute, and the House was the first body to approve the &quot;money bill&quot; portion, N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 18 was not violated. The legislative journals were inconclusive and insufficient to defeat the presumption that a change the conference committee made to the bill's wording was in accord with the legislature's intent. The other change cited by petitioners was merely technical, not material.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Defendant was indicted on one count of certain prohibited uses of computer services. The State filed a motion in limine asking the Rockingham Superior Court (New Hampshire) to admit a detective's testimony concerning his Internet conversation with defendant. The trial court denied the motion. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c11">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">The detective posed as a 14-year-old girl in an Internet chat room, and defendant, believing that he was dealing with a teenaged girl, solicited a sex act for money. Earlier, the trial court held that the detective's interception was illegal under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 570-A:1 (2001), and the State did not appeal. In its own motion, the State argued that exclusion of the detective's testimony about the communication was not required by N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 570-A:6 (2001) since the detective's knowledge of the communication was obtained through his own observations, not through the illegal interception. The appellate court agreed. Under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 570-A:2, I(c), the detective would not have been disclosing information &quot;obtained through the interception&quot; because his knowledge about the contents of the conversation came from his personal observations as a participant. Assuming the detective relied on his own memory of the conversation, his testimony would be the same regardless of whether the interception occurred and was thus admissible. Since the testimony was admissible, the procedural requirements of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 570-A:9 did not apply.</SPAN></P>
