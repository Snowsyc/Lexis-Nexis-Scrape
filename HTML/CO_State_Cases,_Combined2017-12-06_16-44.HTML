<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">HOLDINGS: [1]-Petitioners lacked standing to challenge the scholarship program under the Colorado Public School Finance Act of 1994 because nothing in the Act suggested that the Colorado General Assembly intended to allow private parties to redress violations of the Act in court; the Act, in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-54-120(1) (2014), manifested the General Assembly's intent that the Colorado State Board of Education, not private citizens, be responsible for ensuring lawful implementation; [2]-The program created financial partnerships between the school district and religious schools and, in so doing, facilitated students attending such schools, thus constituting aid to religious institutions as contemplated by Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7; because Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7 prohibited school districts from aiding religious schools, the program was in violation of the Colorado Constitution.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-The members had no such rights because PERA legislation providing COLAs established no such contract between PERA and its members, so legislation altering the COLA formula did not violate the contract clauses in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11, as the legislature stated no clear intent to be contractually bound, while it used such language to describe the underlying pension benefit, and mandatory language in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 24-51-1001(1) and 24-51-1002(2) (2014) was directed at the PERA administrator, not the legislature, so retirees could not reasonably expect the state's provision of a given COLA was a statutory contract.</SPAN></P>

Section 19-3-507(5)(a)'s three-month time requirement did not apply to parents, grandparents, or relatives. Instead, it permitted parents, grandparents, and relatives to intervene as a matter of right without regard to whether the child had previously been in their care. That reading conformed with the legislative purpose and scheme of the Children's Code, was supported by the legislative history of the provision, and avoided a potentially unconstitutional alternative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner utility sought judicial review of respondent Colorado Division of Property Taxation, Department of Local Affairs' (DPT), refusal to apply the intangible property exemption in Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The utility sought assessment in the same way as its cable company competitors. The supreme court held the intangible property exemption did not apply because (1) it was not found in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-4-102 (2012), and (2) Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-4-102(1)(b) (2012) required the DPT administrator to consider the utility's intangible property. The cost cap valuation method did not apply because (1) it capped a locally assessed entity's value, and (2) the utility's value was determined under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-4-102 (2012). Equal protection was not violated because (1) the statutory scheme was presumed constitutional as no fundamental right or suspect classification was involved, (2) a failure to receive cable companies' tax benefits did not negate every conceivable basis for the scheme, and (3) this was consistent with rational policy choices. Colorado's uniform taxation clause in Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3(1)(a) allowed the scheme because (1) it required uniform assessment in the same territory, and (2) the utility was assessed state-wide, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-4-102 (2012), while the cable companies were assessed locally, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-1-103(5)(a) (2012).</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the system failed to pass constitutional muster under the rational basis test. The financing system was also constitutional under the Local Control Clause of the Colorado Constitution, Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 15. The system afforded local school districts control over locally-raised funds and therefore over &quot;instruction in the public schools.&quot; The local control built into the financing system provided each school district with the opportunity for experimentation and innovation in using limited resources to achieve educational excellence.

The court presented the issue of referencing jurors by number as its general practice. This general practice did not suggest anything in particular with regard to this defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance barred bicycles from some city streets. The supreme court held the ordinance was a matter of mixed state and local concern because (1) the record showed the ordinance affected the expectations of residents outside respondent city and created a &quot;ripple effect&quot; impacting other communities, (2) the state traditionally regulated bicycle transportation by giving bicyclists the same rights and responsibilities as other vehicle operators, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1412(1) (2012), (3) the Colorado Constitution did not specifically commit the regulation of bicycles to the city or the state, and (4) both the city and the state had important interests in the matter, as the state had an interest in the consistent application of statewide laws to avoid patchwork bicycle regulations, while the city had an interest, under Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 6, in controlling traffic on its streets, as authorized by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-111(h) (2012). The ordinance conflicted with and was preempted by state law because it conflicted with Colo. Rev.

As such, they did not petition any branch of government for a redress of grievances. They did not bring suit against a governmental entity in an effort to overturn an administrative decision. Their arbitration action was not instituted in an attempt to vindicate the rights of the public. The companies' alleged petitioning activity did not merit protection under the First Amendment right to petition and POME. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by trebling the exemplary damages award against the companies under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-102(3). The companies made multiple requests that the employee submit to an independent medical examination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee had gone to work for a competitor. The employee's malicious prosecution action was based on an arbitration that the employers had filed against him pursuant to an arbitration clause in the parties' employment agreement. The court held that a heightened standard of protection for petitioning activity protected by U.S. Const. amend. I did not apply in this case because the underlying alleged petitioning activity was the filing of an arbitration complaint in a purely private dispute. The employers did not petition any branch of government for a redress of grievances, and the arbitration was not instituted in an attempt to vindicate the rights of the public. The trial court did not err in denying the employers' request to include additional elements reflecting a heightened standard in the jury instructions. The court upheld the trebling of exemplary damages under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-102(3), given the employers' harassing behavior, such as multiple requests that the employee submit to an independent medical examination, attempts to gain competitive information from the competitor, and the filing of an original action with the court two weeks prior to trial.</SPAN></P>

A guilty plea foreclosed appellate review of suppression issues. The court declined to create by judicial decision an exception allowing conditional guilty pleas that reserved the right to appeal a pretrial motion to suppress evidence because a reservation of that right was better created by statute or court rule, if at all.</SPAN></P>

The regents' decision to terminate the professor's employment for academic misconduct was a quasi-judicial action functionally comparable to a judicial process. Hence, the regents were entitled to absolute immunity concerning their decision to terminate the professor. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ruled that the professor, who had engaged in repeated instances of academic dishonesty, was not entitled to the equitable remedies of reinstatement and front pay. The professor's bad faith investigation claim was barred by qualified immunity because the regents' investigation into the professor's academic record did not implicate a clearly established statutory or constitutional right or law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's adoption of the Moreno/South Map did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The trial court was reasonable in placing its concern for present communities of interest above a mechanistic attempt to minimize the disruption of existing district boundaries. While the adopted plan moved almost 1.4 million Coloradoans from their existing districts, it appeared that the trial court adopted the proposed map that it determined best balanced the many competing interests at stake. This conclusion was reasonable and was supported by the evidence, and thus, was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The trial court properly applied the controlling law and adopted a lawful redistricting scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two political organizations distributed seventeen political advertisements that cost more than $200 each. An ethics organization alleged that the advertisements violated Colo. Const. art. XXVIII. Because none of the ads contained words or phrases that specifically directed the viewer to &quot;vote for,&quot; &quot;elect,&quot; or &quot;support&quot; a candidate, the facts were insufficient to render the ads subject to regulation as &quot;express advocacy.&quot; That term was limited to speech that explicitly advocated for the election or defeat of a candidate through the use of the &quot;magic words&quot; set out in Buckley. Because none of the ads at issue amounted to &quot;expenditures&quot; under Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(8), the Supreme Court of Colorado held that neither political organization met the definition of a &quot;political committee&quot; under Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(12)(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Colorado Court of Appeals ruled that Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20 (Amendment 1) required statewide voter approval each time petitioner Colorado Department of Revenue (Department) calculated an increase in the amount of tax due per ton of coal extracted as directed by the tax rate formula contained in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-29-106 (2011). The Department petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court noted that because the limitations of Amendment 1 applied only to discretionary action taken by legislative bodies, the Department's implementation of the formula and collection of the tax did not require voter approval. The Department had no tax making or tax policy change authority. It could not modify the coal severance tax statutory mechanism or refuse to implement it. The rule the Department adopted in 2007 following a fifteen-year hiatus in implementation of the statute merely paralleled and enforced the statute. The amount of tax due was simply a function of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-29-106's tax rate. The Department's duties were plainly non-discretionary under the statute. The Department had no taxing or tax policy-making authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in elevating his kidnapping convictions from class four to class two felonies for the reason that he sexually assaulted his kidnap victims. He argued that People v. Henderson, which had held that sexual assault was not a lesser included offense of second degree kidnapping involving sexual assault, should be overruled in light of the subsequent U.S. Supreme Court holdings in Blakely v. Washington and Apprendi v. New Jersey. The high court declined to do so. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-408 (2010) barred the conviction of both a greater and its lesser-included offense; whether an offense was a lesser-included offense was determined by a strict comparison of the elements of the two offenses (the &quot;strict elements test&quot;). Nothing in the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretations of  U.S. Const. amends. V or VI undermined the high court's prior determination that legislative reliance on a distinction between elements and sentencing factors evidenced an intent to avoid the creation of a new offense of second degree kidnapping involving sexual assault, into which the lesser offense of sexual assault could then merge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's instruction on the elements of reckless manslaughter stated that the People had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant recklessly caused death. The trial court charged the jury on the interaction between self-defense and the knowing and reckless requirements of the respective charges, and gave a carrying instruction stating the People did not bear the burden of disproving that defendant acted in self-defense with respect to the reckless manslaughter charge. The high court held that instructing the jury under &sect; 18-1-704(4) that the People bore no burden of disproving self-defense with respect to crimes, such as reckless manslaughter, for which self-defense was not an affirmative defense did not improperly shift the prosecution's burden to prove recklessness, extreme indifference, or criminal negligence. So long as the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding the elements of the charged crime, a carrying instruction using the language of &sect; 18-1-704(4) was not constitutionally erroneous. People v. Lara, 224 P.3d 388 (Colo. App. 2009), and People v. Taylor, 230 P.3d 1227 (Colo. App. 2009), were overruled to the extent that they held contrary.</SPAN></P>

Because the child had lived in Colorado for six consecutive months immediately before the father commenced the custody proceeding and had not live in Nebraska for six consecutive months, Colorado, and not Nebraska, was the child's home state. Because Colorado, and not Nebraska, had jurisdiction as the child's home state and Colorado did not decline jurisdiction on the ground that Nebraska was more appropriate, Neb. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a suit arising from injuries suffered by respondent, an utility company lineman, while working on a wooden utility pole owned by petitioner, petitioner appealed a decision of the Colorado Court of Appeals that affirmed a judgment in favor of the lineman, arguing that the award of exemplary damages violated the Due Process Clause and that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that its conduct was willful and wanton.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial, the jury found petitioner negligent for failing to maintain a utility pole that collapsed while the lineman was climbing it as part of his employment with a utility company and awarded compensatory and exemplary damages to the lineman. On review, the court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-102(1)(b) (2010) did not violate due process because it did not permit a jury to award exemplary damages to punish a defendant for harm to non-parties; instead, the statute complied with the Philip Morris ruling by merely permitting a jury to consider the rights and safety of others in assessing the willful and wanton nature (i.e., the reprehensibility) of defendant's conduct. Further, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that petitioner's failure to implement a periodic pole inspection for the 46 years prior to the accident at issue was willful and wanton beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore satisfied the requirements for an exemplary damages award under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-102(1)(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court concluded the prosecution was on notice that the constitutionality of defendant's plea would be at issue. The prosecution instituted questioning in which it sought to establish that defendant had a knowing, voluntary, intelligent plea. The magistrate explicitly stated that he was considering setting aside the guilty plea as unconstitutional. The prosecution was on notice of this issue. Defendant filed his Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion within eighteen months of the date of conviction, as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402(1). The trial court was permitted to address the issue of whether defendant's guilty plea was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The Colo. R. Crim. P. 11 court fell short of its duty to ensure defendant's understanding of the important constitutional rights he possessed, and that were waived by pleading guilty. Defendant was not informed of and did not understand the alternative courses of action available to him. Because he could not write or read in English or Spanish, defendant could not have understood the important constitutional rights waived by pleading guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Five defendants jointed in a motion to suppress evidence derived from illegal wiretaps, claiming that the orders authorizing wiretap surveillances were invalid because the judge who issued them did so while his son worked in the District Attorney's Office. The trial court granted the motion to suppress. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court concluded that when issuing the wiretap orders, the chief judge acted as a detached and neutral magistrate, and therefore, the evidence should not have been suppressed on this ground. The supreme court made an independent determination that there was sufficient probable cause to issue the wiretap orders. There was no evidence suggesting the chief judge was involved with law enforcement or was receiving any personal benefit from the issuance of the warrants, and the affidavits contained sufficient probable cause to issue the wiretap orders. The affidavit satisfied Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-15-102(2)(f) (2010). There was no support for the trial court's finding that the renewal application for Subject Telephone Two did not contain a statement of results sufficient to support the issuance of the extension order. The fifteen-day reports were proper. The notice issues did not warrant suppression of the evidence. Defendants did not claim prejudice from the late delivery of materials because they initially succeeded on their motion to suppress the wiretap evidence.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the nature of the claim and relief sought required a court to determine whether the well owners had the right to use water from their wells without State interference. Such a determination was a water matter that fell uniquely within the jurisdiction of the water court. The well owners had no constitutionally protected property interest in the unfettered use of the water in their wells; consequently, they could not show that the State had taken their property by curtailing the out-of-priority use of their wells. The well owners neither held title to the water in their decreed wells, nor was their right to use the water unfettered. The State's order did not deprive the well owners of any constitutionally protected right to the unfettered use of the water in their wells; the well owners had no such right. The Water Right Determination and Administration Act of 1969 preserved Colorado's prior appropriation doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant parents challenged a judgment of the Colorado Court of Appeals that affirmed a lower court judgment denying their petition to terminate a consensual guardianship of their child, arguing that the lower courts erred in concluding that, when the parents consented to the guardianship, they lost the presumption that their decision to terminate that guardianship was in the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Parents entered into a guardianship relationship with appellees, non-parent relatives, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-14-204(2)(a) (2010) to allow them to address the mother's post-partum depression. When they petitioned to terminate the guardianship, the guardians objected. The trial and appellate courts ruled that, by consenting to the guardianship, the parents lost the constitutional presumption that they made decisions in the best interests of their child. On review, the court held that, where the guardianship was established through parental consent, the parents delegated the day-to-day care, custody, and control of their child to the guardians. However, just as the fit parents' decision to consent to the guardianship was presumed to be in the best interests of the child, so too was their subsequent decision to seek termination of the guardianship and regain care, custody, and control of the child presumed to be in the best interests of the child. In the absence of a limitation in the guardianship order, when fit parents seek to terminate a guardianship, the guardians bear the burden of demonstrating that termination of the guardianship is not in the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding pursuant to Colo. R. App. P. 21, petitioner father sought issuance of a rule to show cause to determine whether the standards enunciated in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), and In re Adoption of C.A., 137 P.3d 318 (Colo. 2006), applied to a trial court's consideration of any order allocating parental responsibilities to a non-parent over the objection of a fit, custodial parent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Even after the father was granted sole custody of the children, he permitted significant ongoing contact with the foster parents from December 2005 until March 2009. After the father decided to cease having the children stay at the foster parents' home, they petitioned for allocation of parenting responsibilities (APR) under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-123(1)(c) (2010). When a child and family investigator (CFI) recommended visits with the foster parents over the father's objection, the El Paso County District Court (Colorado) concluded that the Troxel and C.A. standards were inapplicable to the investigatory stage of an APR proceeding. The court reversed. Pursuant to the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, the father had the fundamental right to make decisions regarding the care, custody, and control of their children. Therefore, ordering visitation with the foster parents had to be in accordance with the Troxel and C.A. standards to determine the best interests of the children, considering the factors in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-124(1.5)(a)-(b). No investigatory exception existed as the father's fundamental liberty interest in raising his children would thus be suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court made the rule absolute, reversed the district court's visitation order, and returned the matter for further proceedings with this decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court, Water Division No. 1, Colorado, awarded costs against appellant mutual ditch company for the trial concerning appellee city's application for a change in the use of water rights. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company argued that, as a mutual ditch company, it was exempt from costs under Colo. R. Civ. P. 54(b) because a substantial number of its shareholders were exempt from costs under that rule. The supreme court noted that the General Assembly had defined a mutual ditch company as an association of three or more people to form a corporation for the purposes of constructing a ditch or reservoir as set forth in its articles of incorporation, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 7-42-101(1). The legislature had not designated mutual ditch companies as state agencies. Given the plain meaning of Rule 54(b), a mutual ditch company was not the state, its officers, or its agencies, and a water court may award costs against a mutual ditch company. Because the company did not make a specific argument regarding the Petition Clause of the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, it did not preserve the issue for review. The right to oppose a water application originated from statutory provisions and was not a fundamental constitutional right.

Stat. &sect; 1-10-107(2) (2009) challenging respondent Ballot Title Setting Board's action in setting the title, ballot title and submission clause, and summary for an initiative that proposed a constitutional amendment to Colo. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 5 that would impose a tax on beverage containers, exempting containers that held alcohol beverages, dairy products, and medicine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court held that the initiative contained multiple subjects in violation of Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(5.5), namely: (1) creating and administering a beverage container tax, and (2) prohibiting the Colorado General Assembly from exercising its legislative authority over the basin roundtables and interbasin compact committee until the year 2015, while embedding these entities within the water sections of the Colorado Constitution and vesting them with significant new authority. The initiative's broad statement of purpose, to protect and preserve the waters of the state, did not properly unite the separate subjects into one. Contrary to the proponents' argument, there was no necessary and proper connection between the establishment and administration of a beverage container tax and a prolonged prohibition on the exercise of the General Assembly's authority over the basin roundtables and the interbasin compact committee. The initiative's prohibition on actions by the General Assembly was especially troubling considering the oversight and authority the General Assembly traditionally had over agencies it established.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated incest and negligent child abuse and was sentenced to 25 years on the child abuse charge. The Colorado Court of Appeals upheld the sentence, holding that consideration of a concurrent conviction did not violate the constitutional requirement - described in Blakely v. Washington and its progeny - that facts must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant petitioned for certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The presumptive sentencing range for negligent child abuse was 4 to 16 years, but the range of possible penalties listed in trial documents stated that a maximum of 32 years imprisonment was possible. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by considering his &quot;concurrent&quot; conviction for aggravated incest during his sentencing for the child abuse charge. The court held that a &quot;concurrent&quot; conviction - or a conviction that issues from the same proceeding as the crime being sentenced - is Blakely-exempt if it is entered according to proper constitutional procedure and prior to sentencing. The trial court properly used defendant's aggravated incest conviction to aggravate defendant's sentence for negligent child abuse beyond the presumptive range. Defendant's conviction for aggravated incest was entered before his sentencing for negligent child abuse. The aggravated incest conviction was Blakely-exempt because there was no error in entering the plea and the conviction predated sentencing for negligent child abuse. It did not matter that the original plea included both the incest and child abuse charges because the incest conviction clearly preceded the child abuse sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After being followed from a store that was the object of police surveillance and being stopped for a traffic infraction, defendant conceded buying a &quot;pot pipe&quot; at the store, took the unwrapped pipe from his pocket, and turned it over to the police. While searching defendant's vehicle, an officer discovered methamphetamine. Defendant was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia and more than one gram of methamphetamine. The trial court granted his motion for suppression of the drugs but denied suppression of the pipe. On appeal, the court found that being stopped for a traffic infraction immediately after leaving a suspect store and being in possession of a recently purchased and still unwrapped &quot;pot pipe,&quot; although sufficient to justify an arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia, was insufficient to provide reasonable, articulable suspicion that additional evidence of that offense might be found in defendant's vehicle. Although it was conceivable that the vehicle might contain some evidence of the possession offense for which the officers had probable cause to arrest, nothing peculiar to the circumstances supported a reasonable suspicion that additional evidence existed.</SPAN></P>

In 2007, the legislature increased the maximum aggregate lump sum available. The Colorado Court of Appeals concluded the claimant was entitled to the additional lump sum payment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant suffered a work-related injury in 1990. The court concluded that the claimant was entitled to the additional lump sum payment under the 2007 amendment to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-406(2) (2009). The 2007 amendment applied prospectively. The claimant requested the additional lump sum payment five months after the legislature amended &sect; 8-43-406. The claimant's rights and CIGA's liabilities vested on December 5, 2006, when an administrative law judge determined that the claimant was permanently and totally disabled and ordered CIGA to pay her PTD benefits. Neither the $ 26,292 lump sum payment the claimant requested and received in February 2007, nor the additional $ 33,708 payment to which the court found the claimant was entitled, altered these rights or liabilities. Instead, the lump sum payments constituted an advance of the award of PTD benefits to which the claimant already was entitled. The lump sum provision was procedural in nature and applied prospectively to requests for lump sum payments filed subsequent to the amendment's date of enactment, irrespective of the date of the claimant's injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court construed Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-12-208(3) (2009) to impose a two-year time limit on the completion of all proceedings for postconviction review, the certification of the record, and all appellate briefing and to prohibit extensions of any kind beyond that time. Although it upheld what it considered to be the legislatively imposed two-year limit, the trial court found the prohibition against any extension beyond that period unconstitutional for conflicting with Colo. R. Crim. P. 32.2 and infringing on the rulemaking power of the judiciary. The supreme court held that because &sect; 16-12-208(3) does not itself impose an absolute two-year time limit on presenting a unitary appeal to the supreme court but rather directs it to do so, the trial court misconstrued the statute as conflicting with the rule. Because the rule implements the legislature's direction by imposing a series of highly specific time limits, which are designed to meet the two-year goal when, but only when, that can be accomplished without violating the defendant's constitutional rights or the legislature's other expressly articulated goals, no absolute two-year time limit exists in either statute or rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The plaintiffs argued that Amendment 54 was substantially overbroad on its face. The supreme court found that because Amendment 54 applied to &quot;any government contract&quot; that did not solicit three bids, without including any further limiting language, it was overbroad. Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 15 was over-inclusive as it failed to tailor its prohibitions towards those who had some control over awarding no-bid contracts, which would be directly correlated to its purpose of preventing the appearance of impropriety. Some of Amendment 54's penalty provisions were overbroad. Amendment 54's prohibition on contributions made on behalf of family members served to substantially chill speech. A restriction on U.S. Const. amend. I activity for those that served a nonprofit fell outside of Amendment 54's plainly legitimate sweep. Possible applications of Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 15 rendered it unconstitutionally vague with respect to prohibited contributions of immediate family members. The organized labor provisions violated U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV. The entire amendment was unconstitutional and could not be salvaged as a meaningful legislative enactment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The police were summoned and were able to remove defendant following a struggle. Defendant was convicted of harassment and obstructing an officer. While the State requested that defendant be required to undergo a domestic violence evaluation, the county court held that there was no evidence of an intimate relationship because there was no testimony about a sexual relationship and that, without evidence of a sexual relationship, a domestic violence evaluation would be inappropriate. The district court affirmed. On review, the court held that, while a sexual relationship may be an indicator of an intimate relationship, it was not a necessary condition of an intimate relationship for the purpose of the Colorado domestic violence statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-800.3 (2009). The relationship must be more than that of a roommate, friend, or acquaintance; there must be a romantic attachment or shared parental status between the parties.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents, towns, requested injunctive relief to prevent the Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Revenue from hearing an appeal filed by petitioners, home builders, from the towns' denial of a use tax refund request. The district court dismissed the injunction. The Colorado Court of Appeals reversed and enjoined the Executive Director's proceedings. Certiorari review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The builders requested and obtained an informal hearing by the towns to review the denial of their use tax refund requests. Following the informal hearing, the towns insisted that the builders request a formal hearing before their Finance Directors, as a pre-condition to exercising the right of appeal under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2-106.1 (2009) to the Executive Director. The reviewing court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2-106.1 provided for only an informal hearing at the local level and superseded provisions of the towns' codes that required a taxpayer to submit to a formal hearing. The reviewing court agreed with the district court that the Executive Director had jurisdiction to hear the use tax refund appeals because the builders properly exhausted its local remedies in accordance with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2-106.1. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2-106.1 (2009) contained its own controlling prescription for exhaustion of local remedies that defined and controlled the appellate process in local sales and use tax appeals. A local government was not free to ignore or frustrate a taxpayer's effort to exercise its appellate rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff nonprofit theaters sued defendant Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, seeking a judgment declaring Colorado's ban on theatrical smoking to be an unconstitutional infringement on their freedom of speech and an order enjoining its enforcement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that, even assuming that theatrical smoking actually could amount to protected expressive conduct under some circumstances, the statutory ban on such smoking contained in the Colorado Clean Indoor Act did not impermissibly infringe on the theaters' constitutionally protected freedom of expression under the U.S. and Colorado Constitutions because it was content neutral and narrowly tailored to serve the State's substantial interest in protecting the public health and welfare. There was no question that the State's legitimate interest in preserving and improving the health, comfort, and environment of the public was furthered by limiting the public's exposure to environmental smoke, even from tobacco-free alternatives. Apart from its interest in the public's physical health, the State had a weighty, essentially esthetic interest in proscribing intrusive and unpleasant formats for expression sufficient to justify a content-neutral restriction on expression. The connection between limiting exposure to environmental smoke and banning indoor public smoking in places of public accommodation was apparent without further evidentiary support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's tax returns and other documents were seized from the office of his tax preparer, along with several thousand other client files, pursuant to a search warrant. The trial court found that the search warrant, which did not identify defendant or the tax preparer as the target of the search, was invalid and that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply because the warrant lacked indicia of probable cause. The court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that the search was essentially a fishing expedition and that the officers' reliance on the warrant was objectively unreasonable. Probable cause to search defendant's individual file was absent because the supporting affidavit, which indicated only that some clients might have provided false information to the tax preparer, did not establish any connection at all between defendant and criminal activity. Without evidence of a pervasive fraudulent scheme, searching all files could not be justified. Defendant had standing to invoke the protections of the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, because he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his tax documents in the possession of the tax preparer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that plaintiff school districts lacked standing to sue defendant State, and that plaintiff parents, who challenged the adequacy of the state's public school funding system under the education clause of the Colorado Constitution, presented a nonjusticiable political question. Plaintiffs sought review of the appellate court's judgment on school district standing and justiciability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs alleged that Colorado's public school system violated the mandate set forth in Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, that the legislature provide a &quot;thorough and uniform&quot; system of public education throughout the state. The court concluded that plaintiffs were entitled to the opportunity to prove their allegations. To be successful, plaintiffs would have to prove that the state's current public school financing system was not rationally related to the legislature's constitutional mandate to provide a thorough and uniform system of public education. Although the State asserted that Amendment 23, Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 17, put in context, set the constitutionally minimum level of state funding required by the education clause, and therefore, plaintiffs did not present a justiciable question, the court noted that Amendment 23 prescribed minimum increases for state funding of education and was not intended to qualify, quantify, or modify the thorough and uniform mandate expressed in the education clause. Consequently, the Amendment 23 mandate related solely to a minimum level of funding and did not affect the court's holding that plaintiffs presented a justiciable claim for relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The towing company operated as a towing carrier and had obtained a permit from the PUC, pursuant to Colo. Rev.

The car owner filed a complaint with the PUC alleging that the towing company refused a timely release of his car and personal belongings, including his wife's insulin medication. The PUC initiated an investigation into the alleged complaint. The towing company challenged the lead investigator's credential, and it failed to provide requested documents. The towing company was fined. The towing company claimed that 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 14501(c) preempted PUC regulations concerning towing carriers. Additionally, the towing company contended that the PUC rule authorizing a civil penalty for failure to provide records constituted a warrantless search in violation of the U.S. and Colorado Constitutions. The supreme court held that 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 14501(c) did not preempt the state from regulating towing carriers conducting non-consensual tows.

The court of appeals held that the trial court erred in excluding testimony from a therapist of defendant's stepdaughter. Rather than deciding whether the error was harmless, the court of appeals remanded the case to the trial court. Upon recertification, the court of appeals found the error harmless according to the standard for evaluating nonconstitutional error. The Supreme Court of Colorado agreed with the outcome. By conditioning a designation of federal constitutional error on a determination that the error would impact the verdict sufficiently to be constitutionally material, the court of appeals applied the wrong legal standard. Because the exclusion of the therapist's testimony did not deprive defendant of a meaningful opportunity to challenge the victim's credibility, the error did not rise to the level of federal constitutional error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The District Court, City and County of Denver, Colorado, affirmed an eviction of petitioner tenant by the county court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court noted that the county court correctly determined that the owner provided adequate notice of the grounds upon which her demand for possession was predicated. Nothing more was required than notification of the legal ground upon which the owner claims a right of possession, and the inclusion of pattern language of compliance did not render the owner's demand equivocal or conditional. The county court's oral order of restitution, however, was not supported by the statutorily required finding of an unlawful detention. The county court correctly understood that the owner had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a violation of the lease. The county court never found proof of prohibited criminal activity. Unlawful detention for violation of a covenant of the lease, whether express or implied by statute, required proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the covenant was actually violated - not merely that the owner had reasonable grounds to believe it was violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers were two couples who purchased property as tenants in common and subsequently donated the property as a conservation easement. The taxpayers split the value of the donated easement in half and claimed tax credits totaling $ 154,700 pursuant to the Conservation Easement Tax Credit Act. The Conservation Easement Tax Credit Act limited the amount of the credit allowed to $100,000 per donation. The reviewing court held that although each taxpayer could claim a tax credit, the statute expressly limited the amount of the credits claimed to an aggregate total of $ 100,000 per donation. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-22- 522(2) (1999) did not allow each taxpayer to claim a tax credit of up to $ 100,000. The reference to &quot;per donation&quot; necessarily limited the available tax credit to an aggregate of $ 100,000. Because the tax credits claimed by the taxpayers exceeded $ 100,000, the Department correctly issued the notices of deficiency to the taxpayers. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-22-522 (1999) limited the tax credit given to a tenancy in common for a donated conservation easement to $ 100,000.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 13-21-101 (2009); it was unconstitutional to award interest earned during the period between the accrual of the cause of action and the entry of judgment at a different rate based on whether or not a judgment debtor appealed. Because the creditor did not request, and was therefore not awarded, pre-judgment interest, she could not receive interest for the time period between the accrual date and the judgment date, regardless of whether it was termed &quot;post-judgment&quot; interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayer, a nonprofit organization affiliated with a church, challenged an assessment by respondent city of sales and use taxes associated with a facility that provided care and housing for the elderly. The trial court found that the facility was not exempt from taxation, and the Colorado Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the operation of the facility was a religious activity. Both parties sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Colorado Supreme Court interpreted Pueblo, Colo., Mun. Code, &sect; 14-4-76 (2008), which provided an exemption for charitable organizations, as requiring that an organization be engaged in qualifying activities in order to be eligible for the exemption, regardless of whether it was a religious or charitable organization with I.R.C. &sect; 501(c)(3) status. Under that interpretation, the operation of the facility was not a charitable organization because its ministry to the physical, mental, and spiritual needs of residents was not exclusively free and voluntary and because it did not exclusively lessen the burden of government. Its services were not exclusively provided freely and voluntarily in part because they were provided on a quid pro quo transactional basis. If a resident required more intensive nursing care, that care was provided for an additional cost. The pricing and fee structure indicated the transactional, rather than charitable, nature of the services provided. The fact that the facility maintained some residents who were unable to pay for the services they received did not change the analysis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the holding of the court of appeals and remanded the case in order to provide the parties with an opportunity to raise issues and present additional evidence as appropriate under the clarified understanding of the definition of &quot;charitable organization,&quot; given that the focus below was on whether the taxpayer engaged in religious activity, rather than the question of whether it was a charitable organization.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Governmental defendants appealed a judgment of the District Court of the City and County of Denver, Colorado, finding unconstitutional the amendments to the Colorado School Finance Act made by SB 07-199 that allowed local school districts to collect and expend revenues in excess of the property tax revenue limitations of Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The effect of SB 07-199 was to shift some of the burden of funding public schools from the state back to local school districts. In this case, plaintiffs sought a refund of $ 117.8 million allegedly collected in violation of Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20. The court concluded that the legislature was acting within constitutional limits when it amended the School Finance Act. SB 07-199's treatment of school districts as the relevant taxing authorities for purposes of waiving the revenue limits was consistent with constitutional provisions governing dual state/local funding and constitutional provisions applicable to public education. Plaintiffs failed to show that SB 07-199 violated the Colorado Constitution. Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20(4)(a), did not require a second election, at either the local or state level, for legislation directing how revenue received as a result of a waiver election should be used. The school districts remained the relevant taxing authority for purposes of the locally raised revenue, and a statewide vote was not required to waive a revenue limit at the local level. The local school district elections validly waived the revenue limit at issue in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, Colorado's North Sterling Irrigation District (NSID), filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, seeking a determination as to whether defendant state and division engineers could administer NSID's water rights according to a fixed water year. Intervenors, a city, a water district, and well users, also participated in the suit. The District Court, Water Division 1 (Colorado), ruled in favor of the engineers. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The engineers advised NSID that its diversions under its storage rights would be based on a November 1 to October 31 water year, and that after it obtained one annual fill of its decreed rights, it calls would not be honored until the administrative water year began anew on November 1. The high court held that as NSID's storage decrees were silent as to the administration of the one-fill rule, the engineers had authority under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 37-92-501, -502 (2008) to determine how to administer Colorado's one-fill mandate; thus, the use of a fixed water year was proper. That NSID had operated under low-point administration for almost 100 years was immaterial, as water rights were not administered according to custom. The fixed water year did not itself interfere with NSID's decreed storage rights, but was merely the administrative mechanism by which the one-fill rule lawfully limited those rights. As NSID's rights had historically been administered consistent with a fixed water year, it suffered no legal injury due to the change in administrative policy. Intervenors' claims of derivative injury to their own water rights were not grounds to contest the engineers' authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The John Does, who were wrongfully arrested because of the former sheriff's malfeasance, wanted the criminal records of their arrests sealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Colorado Court of Appeals held that the transfer of monies from 28 of 31 special funds did not violate Colo. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3 and 4. As to the transfers from the remaining three funds, the appellate court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of respondents, the Governor of Colorado and the Colorado State Treasurer, and remanded the case for further proceedings. The parties petitioned for certiorari review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The instant court concluded that petitioners had taxpayer standing to challenge the fund transfers, the transfers did not violate Amendment 1, Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20, and the appellate court erred in reversing the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Governor and the State Treasurer with respect to petitioners' article XI claims. The transfers did not constitute a tax policy change directly causing a net tax revenue gain and did not trigger Amendment 1's voter approval requirement. The transfer of fees from the special cash funds to the state's general fund did not transform those fees into taxes, nor did the transfers result in a net revenue gain within the meaning of Amendment 1. The post-transfer collection of fees by the cash funds did not constitute a new tax or a tax rate increase. The transfers did not create unconstitutional debt in violation of article XI of the Colorado Constitution. Even if the cash funds were public trusts, they were not irrevocable trusts, and the legislature had the authority to amend them to allow for the transfer of monies to the general fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the appellate court was affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case was remanded to the appellate court to be returned to the trial court with directions to enter judgment in favor of the Governor and the State Treasurer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insurer sued defendant uninsured car owner to recover damages to an insured vehicle. The District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) did not allow an appeal of a default judgment against the owner because although the owner was indigent, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-6-311(1)(a) (2007) and Colo. R. Civ. P. 411(a) required her to post a judgment bond. The owner petitioned for a rule to show cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether an indigent defendant had to post a judgment bond as a precondition for appealing an adverse money judgment from the county court to the district court. The owner argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-16-103 (2007) allowed her as an indigent party to appeal the default judgment obtained against her by the insurer without first having to post a judgment bond. A county court party found to be indigent and allowed to proceed in forma pauperis was not required to post a judgment bond before appealing to the district court. However, as with appeals from the district court to the court of appeals, the prevailing party in the county court would be able to execute the judgment while the appeal was still pending because the judgment would not have been stayed by a judgment bond. This interpretation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-6-311 (2007) and Colo. R. Civ. P. 411 properly reflected Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-16-103 (2007)'s requirement that court costs be waived for indigent parties. It was also consistent with the appellate court's wide range of case law in other appellate proceedings waiving appellate fees like judgment bonds for indigent parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The rule to show cause was made absolute. The district court was ordered to allow the owner to proceed with her appeal without first posting a judgment bond.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent corporation sought a business license to operate a sexually-oriented business in petitioner city. The city council denied the business license because the location of the proposed business was within one thousand feet of an occupied single-family residence. The corporation filed a Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4) appeal. A trial court affirmed the decision. The Colorado Court of Appeals reversed. The instant court granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals found that the city counsel was foreclosed from considering and receiving evidence concerning the residence because an ordinance restricted the council to considering only the grounds for denial provided by the city staff. The council found that the corporation's premises was located within one thousand feet of an occupied single-family residence, in violation of Commerce City, Colo., Ordinance art. II, &sect; 21-39(1). The instant court held that, under Commerce City, Colo., Ordinance &sect; 9-456(d), while the council had to consider the city staff's reason for denying the license, it could have also heard other evidence regarding compliance with the zoning and use requirements applicable to the license being sought. The corporation's argument that the council was restricted to the ground relied on by the city staff in denying the license was not supported by the ordinances read as a whole and led to an absurd conclusion. The council did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to order issuance of the license based on the existence of an occupied single-family residence located within one thousand feet of the proposed sexually-oriented business.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed. The case was remanded to the court of appeals for consideration of the other issues the corporation raised in its appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee home rule municipality (the town) sought to condemn 572 acres of nearby property for open space and park purposes. Appellant owners contested the condemnation, relying on Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-1-101(4)(b) (2007) (subsection 4b). The San Miguel District Court (Colorado) ruled that subsection 4b unconstitutionally denied home rule municipalities their eminent domain power under Colo. Const. art. XX. Appellants challenged the ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners argued that the town was barred from condemning the property by subsection 4b, which prohibited home rule municipalities from condemning property outside municipal boundaries for parks, recreation, open space, or other similar purposes. Colo. Const. art. XX granted home rule municipalities the power to condemn property for any lawful, public, local, and municipal purpose. Because the Colorado General Assembly could not deny home rule municipalities the eminent domain power conferred to them in the constitution, subsection 4b was unconstitutional with respect to home rule municipalities. The  extraterritorial condemnation of property for parks and open space constituted a lawful, public, local, and municipal purpose within the scope of art. XX.  Thus, the town's condemnation of the property was lawful. The court rejected the contention that the town's eminent domain power was limited to the purposes enumerated in Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 1. It was not necessary to weigh competing state and local concerns implicated by the exercise of that authority to determine whether the authority could be preempted by the legislature when the action was authorized by the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that in pursuing such activities, the unions did not make prohibited campaign expenditures in violation of Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 3(4)(a) because the payment of union staff salaries for time spent organizing these events fell within the membership communication exception of Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(8)(b)(III), which allowed &quot;payments for communication solely with members and their families.&quot; The court also held that the unions did not make prohibited contributions under Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 3(4)(a) when they organized these events for members. The court concluded that allowing the same payments to be protected from regulation as expenditures yet prohibited as contributions would be contrary to the will of the electorate and would result in an unreasonable application of Article XXVIII. Thus, the membership communication exception had to be extended to the definition of a &quot;contribution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the elector contended the ballot initiative was unconstitutional because it violated the single-subject requirement of the Colorado Constitution; the elector also argued that the titles of the initiative were misleading and did not correctly and fairly express the initiative's true intent and meaning. The supreme court disagreed and held that the initiative contained only one subject in compliance with Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(5.5): the establishment of a just cause requirement for discharging or suspending an employee. All of the sections of the measure related to this subject and the necessary association existed among the provisions of the initiative, in that each provision related to creating, implementing, or enforcing a just cause standard in the employment setting for certain employees. Further, the titles set by the Title Board clearly expressed the subject of the initiative and contained no catch phrases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before considering the newspaper's constitutional claims, the appellate court first examined the statutory provisions concerning public access to court documents. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-72-304(4) required that identifying information of sexual assault victims be deleted from records of official actions as well as other criminal justice records prior to their disclosure to the public. Because a grand jury indictment was a record of official action, the trial court could not redact any factual allegations contained in the indictment unless required otherwise by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-72-304(4)(a) or by other law. Although defendant's indictment did not bear the notation &quot;sexual assault,&quot; it was sufficiently related to a possible sexual assault for purposes of the victim protection mandated by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-72-304(4). Thus, the Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-72-301 et seq. (2007), required that the entire indictment be made available for public inspection, subject to the deletion of identifying information of any alleged sexual assault victims. The indictment's allegations were not covered by grand jury secrecy as they were not grand jury evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner was convicted of six counts of second-degree assault under Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18-3-203(1)(b) (1986), among other crimes, and was sentenced to 60 years' imprisonment. Petitioner sought review of a decision of the Colorado Court of Appeals affirming the trial court's disposition of his pro se motions under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(a) and (c) as time-barred under Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16-5-402(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After petitioner's convictions, the case of People v. Nguyen was decided. Nguyen held that equal protection was violated by treating attempted second-degree assault under Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18-3-203(1)(b) (1986) as an automatic crime-of-violence for sentencing purposes, because attempted first-degree assault was not an automatic crime-of-violence. Application of Nguyen to petitioner's case would reduce his sentence from 60 years to 30 years on the attempted assault charges; however, his public defender did not argue Nguyen. The court found that petitioner had alleged facts which, if true, would establish justifiable excuse or excusable neglect under Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16-5-402(2)(d), meriting a hearing. The allegation that counsel failed to inform the trial court of the constitutional limitations of petitioner's sentence, which in turn resulted in a sentence twice the constitutionally permissible level, was within the standard for measuring ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland. The public defender could not argue its own office's ineffective assistance due to a conflict of interest, so appointment of other counsel was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals with directions that it return the case to the trial court to appoint conflict-free counsel for petitioner and hold a hearing on the issue of whether petitioner was entitled to relief from the post-conviction time bar based on justifiable excuse or excusable neglect under Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16-5-402(2)(d).</SPAN></P>

The District Court, Water Division 3 (Colorado), upheld the rules. The opponent challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The artesian pressure requirements were valid where new or increased withdrawals from the confined aquifer system would have caused material injury to existing water rights. Thus, the requirements did not violate the Colo. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 6, right to divert unappropriated waters because the waters were not unappropriated. The one-for-one replacement requirement did not violate the constitutional right to divert unappropriated waters for similar reasons. The rules related to non-irrigated native vegetation were valid as they mirrored Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 37-90-137(12)(a) and 37-92-305(6)(c) (2007) and former Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-90-137(12)(b)(I) (repealed 2004). The finding of injury for new withdrawal was permissible as the rules left open the possibility that an applicant would be permitted to withdraw new water. The rules did not violate statutory authority by regulating only new water uses as there was no authority to regulate existing uses. The rules did not violate equal protection as there was a rational basis for treating the groups at issue differently. Finally, the state engineer was not required to follow the state Administrative Procedure Act in adopting the rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff nonprofit entities and individuals sued defendant governor, alleging that the gift ban provisions of Amendment 41, Colo. Const. art. XXIX, &sect; 1 et seq., were unconstitutional. The District Court for the City and County of Denver (Colorado) found that the bans impermissibly chilled plaintiffs' First Amendment rights and preliminarily enjoined enforcement of them. The governor appealed the injunction and review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor was a proper party defendant where the Ethics Commission, which was responsible for implementing the Amendment, had not been appointed at the time the case was filed. The governor, as the state's chief executive officer, was thus the proper defendant. The Amendment was self-executing because even though it did not contain a self-executing clause, the language of the Amendment, the Colorado Legislative Council's analysis, and the nature of initiative amendments as a whole suggested that the voters wanted to minimize legislative involvement. Nonetheless, the First Amendment as applied challenge was not ripe for review because the Commission was not in existence and had not yet developed the means to enforce the gift bans. The relief plaintiffs sought, a declaration that the bans were unconstitutional and leaving only the provisions creating the Commission, was only available in a successful facial challenge. Since there was no actual application of the Amendment or a reasonable possibility of enforcement or threat of enforcement, plaintiffs' claims were not real or immediate. Thus, the district court did not have jurisdiction to grant the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The denial of the motion to dismiss on the proper party and self-execution issues was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted certiorari to review the trial court's statutory authority to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences for defendant's convictions for first degree assault and vehicular assault. Both charges, to which defendant pled guilty, arose out of his head-on collision with the victim's truck after a high-speed chase in which defendant attempted to elude the police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As a sentencing statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-408(3) (2007) could be applied equally to a conviction that arose from a trial or a conviction that arose from the entry and acceptance of a guilty plea. Defendant's act of colliding head-on with a victim's truck while he was engaged in a high-speed chase to elude the police was the basis of both the first degree assault and vehicular assault charges. It was that single collision that resulted in serious bodily injury to the victim. The act that was the basis of defendant's first degree assault conviction could not be logically separated from the act that formed the basis of the vehicular assault conviction. Both convictions were supported by evidence of the collision with the victim's truck and the circumstances under which that collision occurred. Because defendant's assault convictions were supported by identical evidence, the trial court was mandated by statute to impose concurrent rather than consecutive sentences for the first degree assault and vehicular assault convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the trial court did not have the statutory authority to impose consecutive sentences, the court reversed and returned the decision to the court of appeals with directions to remand to the trial court for amendment of the mittimus to reflect that the three-year conviction for vehicular assault was to run concurrent with the 15-year conviction for first degree assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The physician's hospital staff privileges were suspended due to allegations that he failed to properly treat patients. Before the peer review process was completed, the physician filed an action against the hospital. The trial court allowed the physician's claim to proceed, and the hospital objected. The supreme court then issued a rule to show cause. In making the rule absolute, the supreme court held that, pursuant to the Colorado Professional Review Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-36.5-101 to -203 (2007), the physician was required to exhaust all peer review administrative remedies before seeking relief in the trial court. This exhaustion requirement under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-36.5-106(7), (8) applied, even though the physician here was seeking money damages for common law claims arising out of the process. Because no final decision had been rendered in this case, the physician had not exhausted his available administrative remedies. The physician's argument relating to a prompt hearing was meritless since his conduct caused several delays.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6-1-101 to -1120 (2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a workers' compensation claim, the carrier denied coverage for back surgery and drugs prescribed by a specialist. During this dispute, the worker died from unrelated causes. Thereafter, his wife filed the instant action against the carrier. Judgment was entered in favor of the carrier, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court held that bad faith tort claims accrued independently of a workers' compensation proceeding; therefore, the law of the case doctrine did not apply. The bad faith tort claims were barred by limits of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-102(1)(a) (2007); there were no facts to support equitable tolling of these claims. Moreover, there was no fiduciary or quasi-fiduciary relationship between a workers' compensation insurer and the insured. The denial of treatment was a statement of a legal opinion, not a misrepresentation of fact required to support a fraud claim, and no exceptions applied. Finally, the public nature of the workers' compensation program did not satisfy per se the public impact requirement for a CCPA claim, nor did the facts in the record support a finding that the public impact element had been satisfied in this particular case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with a drug offense, and the State sought to introduce a laboratory report under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-309(5) (2006). The report was admitted over defendant's objection. The court of appeals found that the report was nontestimonial in nature under Crawford, but it refused to hear defendant's constitutional challenges. It found that the report was admissible, and this appeal followed. On review, the supreme court determined that the report was testimonial in nature under the Sixth Amendment and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect;&nbsp;16 because it was prepared in anticipation prosecution of a crime. However, the procedural notice requirements of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-309(5) (2006) did not deny the right of confrontation; therefore, it was facially constitutional. Moreover, &sect; 6-3-309(5) was constitutionally applied in this case; defense counsel was able to waive the right to confront the technician who prepared the report by not complying with the procedural requirements of &sect; 16-3-309(5). The right to confrontation fell within the class of rights that could have been waived by defense counsel through strategic decisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile was 13 years old when he committed the burglary, and he was 14 years old when he was charged with the crime. On appeal, the court held that the plain language of &sect; 19-2-517(1)(a)(IV), as it existed when the juvenile was charged, was ambiguous as to whether a juvenile had to be 14 when the charged delinquent act occurred or when the prosecution filed the charge. Given the stated purpose of the juvenile justice code and the legislature's intent in enacting the Children's Code, the court held that a juvenile had to have been 14 years old at the time the delinquent act occurred in order for the prosecution to file directly under &sect; 19-2-517(1)(a)(IV). Because the juvenile was 13 when the alleged burglary and thefts took place, the prosecution did not have the authority under &sect; 19-2-517(1)(a)(IV) to charge him as an adult in district court, and the district court did not have the authority to sentence him as an adult for that offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The People sought review of an order from the District Court, Summit County (Colorado), which suppressed evidence seized from defendant's truck following a traffic stop. The People argued that an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror of the truck justified the stop under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-201(4) (2006). Alternatively, the People argued that the stop was justified under the fellow officer rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Believing defendant was involved in drug activity, a Drug Task Force agent contacted police to request that a patrol officer conduct a traffic stop and seek permission to search defendant's truck. The agent did not inform dispatch about earlier observations that he believed established a basis to stop the truck. Instead, he requested that the officer develop an independent basis for a stop. On appeal, the court held that observing an item hanging from a rearview mirror was not automatically a basis for a traffic stop under &sect; 42-4-201(4); instead, an officer had to reasonably believe the item actually obstructed the driver's vision through the windshield. The court deferred to the trial court's findings in the instant case that the evidence failed to show that the officer reasonably believed that defendant's vision through the windshield was obstructed by the air freshener at the time of the stop. The court rejected the People's alternative argument, holding that the fellow officer rule did not apply. The court reasoned that the agent specifically requested that a patrol officer not rely on existing information and instead develop an independent basis to stop defendant's truck.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant attempted to introduce expert testimony at trial that, due to his intellectual disability, he was highly suggestible under interrogation. The trial court excluded proposed expert and lay testimony because it did not comply with Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-107(3)(b). The Colorado Court of Appeals disagreed, held that the statute did not apply, and ordered a new trial. A petition for certiorari was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted at trial of felony sexual assault. The evidence presented at trial included statements made by him directly to the police during a videotaped interrogation. Before trial, he unsuccessfully challenged the admissibility of those statements as the product of an involuntary confession. The substance of the proposed expert testimony, supported by the literature, was that people with intellectual disabilities are more suggestible in a police interview than a person without those disabilities and that they will agree with statements made by the police, even if those statements are not true. During the trial, defendant also unsuccessfully attempted to introduce lay opinion testimony regarding his suggestibility. The court held that based on the language of the statute, &quot;mental condition,&quot; as used in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-107(3)(b), included intellectual disabilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals' conclusion, that exclusion of defendant's expert testimony at trial was error, was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Arapahoe County District Court (Colorado) of, inter alia, four counts of first-degree murder and received the death penalty. After his motion for postconviction relief was denied, defendant appealed. The State cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State argued that the postconviction court erred by determining that defense counsel performed deficiently by deciding not to run a mental health mitigation case without first obtaining an independent, private mental health evaluation. The supreme court agreed. Presenting a mental health mitigation case would have been risky at best given the substantial amount of damaging evidence from the mental health institute that the State had to rebut defendant's claims. The evidence that would have been put forth by the State to rebut a mental health defense not only involved defendant's statements about the crime and victims, but also included evidence of defendant's misbehavior at the institute and the near unanimous view of the staff and doctors that defendant was malingering his symptoms. The postconviction court found the institute witnesses to be credible, and found that their testimony would have undermined the mitigating value of a mental health defense. Such evidence would not have been cumulative of anything else the jury had heard. Even if trial counsel had acted deficiently, the evidence before the jury demonstrated the lack of actual prejudice in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The holding that trial counsel performed deficiently was reversed. The judgment was otherwise affirmed and the case was remanded to set a date for imposition of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to the first-degree murder of a correctional officer at a correctional facility, where he was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for the first-degree murder. Defendant was sentenced to death by the Douglas County District Court (Colorado) under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-1201(1)(a) (2006) which stated that a capital defendant waived his right to a jury trial on sentencing facts when he pled guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to entering his guilty plea, defendant repeatedly stated that he understood that by pleading guilty he was waiving his right to have a jury determine his sentence under &sect; 18-1.3-1201(1)(a). The court held that because under Colorado law defendant was not eligible for the death penalty until all aggravating factors were weighed against all mitigating factors, the presence of one Blakely-exempt aggravating factor standing alone did not make defendant eligible for the death penalty. The court also held that &sect; 18-1.3-1201(1)(a) violated the Sixth Amendment because it mandated that the court sentence defendant who had pled guilty to a class 1 felony. Under the terms of the statute, the court did not need to procure an additional knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of this Sixth Amendment right as was constitutionally required, but instead had to inform the defendant that by pleading guilty he automatically waived his right to a jury trial on sentencing facts. The court found that defendant's waiver could not have been knowing, voluntary, and intelligent because it was infected by the same constitutional infirmity as the statute--it was inextricably linked to his plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The death sentence was reversed and the case was remanded to the district court. On remand, the district court was ordered to set a new sentencing hearing before a newly impaneled jury unless defendant waived his right to jury sentencing. To be valid, defendant's waiver of his Sixth Amendment right would have to be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and not linked to his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the trial court should have held further proceedings on justifiable excuse and made separate findings of fact and law. The court of appeals separated the inmate's fifth claim into two claims, a claim for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to call certain witnesses and a claim for conflict of interest concerning the public defender's office. It incorrectly held that further proceedings were not needed on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim because there was no constitutional or statutory violation requiring relief under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c)(2)(I) as there was no constitutional or statutory right to postconviction counsel. The court of appeals held that the inmate's conflict of interest claim required further proceedings and remanded the case back to the trial court as to that claim alone. However, in Colorado, there was a limited statutory right to postconviction counsel, and the proper standard to be applied was the Strickland test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals was reversed as to its holding that the inmate could not state an ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel claim, and the court of appeals was affirmed as to its ruling on the inmate's conflict of interest claim concerning postconviction counsel requiring further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of various felonies stemming from a high-speed pursuit, including extreme indifference murder and attempted murder after deliberation. In response to defendant's request to videotape the consumptive DNA testing procedures on a shotgun handle, the Jefferson County District Court ruled that it would suppress the test results unless the prosecution paid part of the costs of a defense expert. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court adopted Standard 3.4(e) of the Criminal Justice Section Standards on DNA Evidence, which noted that courts should consider procedures such as videotaping that allowed for independent evaluation of consumptive testing. However, the standard was not applied as the trial court did not assert its Color. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-309 authority over the evidence, address whether it destruction of the evidence would be permitted, or outline the appropriate procedures to permit independent analysis as a condition of consumptive testing. It also did not make findings about the appropriateness of videotaping as a condition of permitting consumptive testing or make findings and conclusions about the objections to videotaping and whether videotaping should have been a part of the testing procedures in this case. Instead, the trial court focused prematurely on sanctions for unreasonable conduct in failing to preserve evidence. Thus, it abused its discretion when it committed to ordering suppression of DNA results for tests that had not yet been conducted if the testing agency refused to permit videotaping and the prosecution refused to pay the expense of a defense expert.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent parents sued petitioner municipalities after their children drowned in ditches. The municipalities moved to dismiss on the ground that a bill amending the exemption from liability in the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-101 et seq. (2001), for sanitation facilities applied retrospectively. Certiorari was granted to review the Colorado Court of Appeals' decision that the legislation operated retrospectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In response to decisions concluding that the municipalities were subject to suit because the ditches constituted sanitation facilities, the General Assembly adopted Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-103(5.5) (2003) to exclude drainage ditches from the definition of public sanitation facility. The municipalities argued that the newly-adopted legislation applied retroactively to bestow immunity on them. The lower court correctly concluded that the municipalities had not overcome the presumption of prospectivity that had to be employed in determining whether the General Assembly intended the legislative amendment to apply retroactively to these cases. Neither the language of the statute, its legislative history, nor the definition of the term in use prior to the adoption of the legislation supported the municipalities' contention that the General Assembly clearly intended the amendments to take retroactive effect. Accordingly, the lower court properly held that &sect; 24-10-103(5.5) operated only prospectively and that the definitions supplied in the case law had to be used to resolve the two pending cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner juvenile was charged as an adult with two counts of first degree murder. On writ of certiorari to the Colorado Court of Appeals, the supreme court granted certiorari to consider the constitutionality of the direct file statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-517 (2006). Petitioner asserted that the sentencing provisions of the direct file statute required an adult sentence and violated certain constitutional doctrines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The direct file statute authorized the prosecutor to charge petitioner as an adult by filing certain enumerated charges directly in the district court. The parties agreed that even though the direct file statute did not expressly authorize direct filing of charges not enumerated by the direct file statute, unenumerated charges could nonetheless be brought together with enumerated charges in a single prosecution based on ancillary jurisdiction. They disagreed, however, as to whether the statute mandated an adult sentence when petitioner was acquitted of the enumerated offenses but convicted of the unenumerated offenses. The supreme court held that the district court had the discretion to sentence petitioner as an adult or as a juvenile when found guilty of unenumerated charges. The supreme court also held that the direct file statute was constitutional. However, because in petitioner's case it was unclear whether the district court exercised the discretion to decide whether to sentence petitioner as a juvenile before sentencing him as an adult, and because the district court did not make findings before imposing an adult sentence, the case had to be remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals upholding petitioner's sentences and remanded with directions for the district court to conduct a new sentencing hearing and to make adequate findings before imposing an adult sentence on petitioner.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-102 were logically inconsistent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court agreed to consider whether the verdicts were indeed inconsistent. On review, the court reversed the part of the judgment finding the verdicts inconsistent. Knowingly causing the death of another, as a matter of law, was not inconsistent with doing so intentionally and after deliberation under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-503(3). Whether acting intentionally or knowingly under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-501, defendant might do so in a manner demonstrating extreme indifference. Whether or not defendant intended the death of a particular individual, it was the nature and circumstances of the killing act by which he sought to accomplish his purpose that elevated his culpability, rather than his intent or the result of his conduct. Because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-102(1)(d) restricted the required killing act to one evidencing an attitude of universal malice, rather than altering the mental state required for commission of the crime, the court of appeals erred in concluding that findings of extreme indifference and specific intent with regard to a particular individual were logically inconsistent. Further, the evidence was sufficient to permit a finding for both elements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner the People of the State of Colorado sought to hold respondent individual in contempt for violating a court order and Colorado law prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law. The presiding disciplinary judge, acting as a hearing master, recommended that the court hold the individual in contempt, fine her $6000, and assess additional legal costs and attorney's fees. The individual appealed the recommendations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hearing master did not clearly err in finding that the individual had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law where she had written letters to an attorney of two mothers in dependent and neglected child cases instructing him to take specific legal measures and once those instructions were ignored, had prepared legal documents for the mothers to file pro se. The individual had also filed a federal action on behalf of herself and one of the children. Colorado's ban on the unauthorized practice of law was not void for vagueness as Colo. R. Civ. P. 201.3(2)(b) unambiguously delineated the activities that were included in the practice of law and the individual understood what the ban prohibited. The ban did not violate free speech as the individual's speech was not impacted. The ban did not violate her right to petition the government as the freedom did not extend to filing a lawsuit on behalf of another. The court had the power to sanction the individual for her actions in federal court. The individual was not entitled to a jury trial as Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-10-101 did not apply to contempt charges and the fine was petty for purposes of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following an amendment to petitioner City's home rule city charter, respondent citizen filed a complaint challenging petitioner City's continuing obligations under economic incentive agreements it entered into with petitioner real estate developers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the developers and the City contended, inter alia, that the home rule city charter amendment did not apply to the agreements and that any such application would have been retroactive and unconstitutionally retrospective. The supreme court agreed, finding that because Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11 prohibited retrospective legislation, vested contractual rights created in the developers could not be annulled by the amendment requiring voter approval of new grants of development subsidies or incentives. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-1-203 (2005), the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts provided the basis for vested contract rights, and the appellate court erred in ruling that vested contract rights had to have an independent existence. Rather, the developers had a contractual right to expect the City Council to exercise its budgetary discretion on an annual basis to determine whether to appropriate economic incentive funds to be paid to the developers under the agreements. Additionally, the agreements did not create a multiple-fiscal year direct or indirect district debt or other financial obligation, as defined by the Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the child's parents died, he was adopted by the adoptive parents, his maternal aunt and uncle. His paternal grandparents sought, and were granted, visitation rights under &sect; 19-1-117. The appellate court reversed, holding that the trial court erred by failing to give &quot;special weight&quot; to the parents' wishes. On review, the court held that the appropriate standard for issuance of an order of grandparent visitation under &sect; 19-1-117 required (1) a presumption in favor of the parental visitation determination; (2) to rebut this presumption, a showing by the grandparents through clear and convincing evidence that the parental visitation determination was not in the child's best interests; and (3) placement of the ultimate burden on grandparents to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the visitation schedule they sought was in the best interests of the child. Because the trial court did not make sufficient findings of fact or identify the &quot;special factors&quot; to which it gave weight in entering the visitation order, the court reversed and remanded the case for additional factual findings and conclusions of law.</SPAN></P>

Appellant left the scene of the accident, and allegedly he failed to seek help. The supreme court was faced with the People's appeal of the trial court's decision, and on the other hand, the argument that the district attorney's office should be disqualified based on a conflict of interest. The supreme court concluded that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 20-1-107 (amended 2002) eliminated appearance of impropriety as a basis for disqualification of district attorneys. Applying &sect; 20-1-107, the supreme court further concluded that it did not authorize disqualification. Disqualification was only proper when: (1) a district attorney requested his own disqualification; (2) the district attorney had a personal or financial interest in the prosecution; or (3) special circumstances existed. In this case, the supreme court concluded the prosecutor was simply performing his prosecutorial duties, and no conflict of interest existed, although the prosecutor received financial backing from the victim's family. Finally, appellant failed to show that he would receive an unfair trial without disqualification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner general assembly (assembly) challenged a decision of the Colorado Court of Appeals in the an action seeking a determination that respondent governor exceeded his constitutional authority to veto distinct &quot;items&quot; within appropriations bills. The trial court upheld the governor's line item veto of definitional headnotes in two appropriations bills (long bills) and rejected the veto of an appropriation in a separate substantive bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The headnotes defined terms such as &quot;capital outlay,&quot; &quot;lease space,&quot; and others. The court held that the headnotes were not &quot;items&quot; subject to the governor's item veto power under Colo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12. The headnotes for health, life, and dental; multiuse network payments; vehicle leases; short term disability; leased space; lease purchase; and legal services deprived the governor of the ability to allocate resources to pay for outstanding expenditures without first obtaining approval from the legislature to use funds from lines already appropriated. The headnotes thus, violated the separation of powers. The headnote that contained a prohibition from covering outstanding vehicle lease payments, lease space, and lease purchases was unconstitutional because it was intertwined with the individual headnotes that limited the governor to a degree that amounted to legislative supervision. The utilities, and computer services headnotes were both affected by the definition of operating expenses and thus were unconstitutional. However, H.B. 02-1246 partially funded a new program and was not a bill funding program. As such, the item veto of the appropriation made therein was invalid.</SPAN></P>

The objectors argued that the initiative addressed multiple subjects in violation of Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(5.5). The proponents of the initiative asserted, and the Title Board agreed, that the text of the initiative contained only one general subject-time limits for ballot issues that would raise, continue, create, or increase taxes. The state supreme court concluded that the initiative violated the single-subject limitation under Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(5.5) because the initiative presented multiple subjects: (1) time limits for tax measures; (2) time limits for public debt authorizations; and (3) time limits for voter authorized relief from spending limits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant slipped on ice in front of her workplace and hit her head on the sidewalk. The division-sponsored medical examination (DIME) physician rated the claimant's whole person impairment at a total of 29 percent. The 5 percent mental impairment rating, when combined with the physical impairments ratings and converted to a whole person rating, produced a DIME rating of 29 percent, pushing the claimant's impairment rating above 25 percent. The court determined that the issue was whether the claimant could combine a mental impairment rating with a physical impairment rating for the purpose of exceeding the $60,000 cap in favor of the $120,000 cap, both of which were contained in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-107.5. The court ruled that the DIME physician contravened the Colorado General Assembly's intent in calculating a 29 percent whole person rating for the claimant. Colo. Rev.

The &quot;knowingly&quot; mens rea in &sect; 18-9-111(4)(b)(III) did not apply to the statutory phrase &quot;in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to suffer serious emotional distress and does cause that person to suffer serious emotional distress.&quot; Instead, &quot;knowingly&quot; applied to the acts of a defendant who &quot;repeatedly follows, approaches, contacts, places under surveillance, or makes any form of communication with&quot; the victim or another enumerated person. The legislature recognized that the stalker in pursuing the victim might be oblivious to objective reality; he or she might not be aware that the repeated acts engaged in would cause a reasonable person to suffer severe emotional distress.

The El Paso County Distict Court, Colorado, dismissed the CCPA and breach of fiduciary duty claims. The client requested a rule to show cause, and he requested relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding, the supreme court considered whether the Colorado Consumer Protection Act applied to attorneys' allegedly deceptive trade practices. The client was seriously hurt in a car wreck. He alleged that he retained the law firm to handle his personal injury case based on the representations made in its advertisements. The client claimed that the firm's viability and profitability as a business depended upon intentionally shortchanging its clients. The supreme court held that attorneys could be held liable for violations of the CCPA. A plaintiff bringing a private CCPA claim against an attorney was required to allege that the attorney or law firm knowingly engaged in a deceptive trade practice, which occurred in the course of the attorney or firm's business, vocation, or occupation, significantly impacting the public as actual or potential consumers of legal services, and causing injury in fact to a legally protected interest. The client's CCPA claim did not duplicate his malpractice claim. Moreover, the supreme court refused to adopt the entrepreneurial distinction test, upon which the district court had relied in dismissing the CCPA claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court remanded the matter to the district court with directions to permit the client to replead his CCPA claim and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant admitted taking cash from fellow employees' unlocked lockers, totaling approximately $ 163. He was found guilty of third degree burglary, a class five felony, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-204 (2005). The Court of Appeals (Colorado) affirmed the conviction concluding that defendant entered or broke into what was tantamount to a vault. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether the court of appeals erred in concluding that defendant entered a &quot;vault&quot; or &quot;apparatus or equipment&quot; under &sect; 18-4-204(1). The supreme court had to determine whether lockers were included within the concept of a &quot;vault&quot; or &quot;other apparatus or equipment&quot; under &sect; 18-4-204(1). The statute contained items that were almost always used to contain money or valuables exclusively: vaults, safes, cash registers, coin vending machines, product dispensers, money depositories, safety deposit boxes, coin telephones, and coin boxes. Those items had specific uses that were plainly evident: it was that appearance that the supreme court found essential to the class. The court held that for an item to be included within the class of items enumerated by the statute, it had to share the same essential characteristics of those items, including having the design and appearance for the safekeeping of money or valuables. Accordingly, the court found that when a locker, as in the case at bar, was unsecured, unlocked, and did not have the appearance of being employed for the safekeeping of valuables, it was not within the class of items contemplated by &sect;&nbsp;18-4-204(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the conviction for third degree burglary was vacated. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent was convicted of, inter alia, attempted second degree murder and second degree assault. The Colorado Court of Appeals held that evidence of mental slowness could be introduced without complying with the pleading requirements of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-103(1.5) (2005) and that the trial court's supplemental instruction improperly excluded evidence of respondent's mental slowness. Certiorari was granted on the two issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Mental slowness was not a mental disease or defect as defined in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-101.5 (2005). Thus, the evidence of mental slowness did not meet the threshold requirements of the affirmative defense of impaired mental condition and respondent did not have to comply with the Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-103(1.5) (2005) pleading requirements. Based upon his constitutional right to due process, respondent's mental slowness could be considered as factual evidence to show that he lacked the required culpable mental state. Thus, the trial court acted properly by admitting evidence of respondent's mental slowness to contest his guilt for the crimes requiring the culpable mental state of knowingly. As for the issue concerning the instruction given during jury deliberations, when the trial court informed the jury that it could have considered any evidence, other than intoxication, to determine whether respondent possessed the culpable mental state of knowingly, that directive permitted the jury to consider evidence of respondent's mental slowness as to whether he acted knowingly. Thus, the supplemental instruction did not preclude the jury from considering respondent's mental slowness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The holding of the lower court was reversed with respect to the jury instruction. The case was remanded to the lower court with directions to return the case to the trial court to reinstate its original judgments of conviction for the crimes of attempted second degree murder, attempted first degree sexual assault, and first degree burglary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff client sued defendant attorney for damages based on professional negligence and other theories. The attorney moved for dismissal and summary judgment, arguing that his advice did not fall below the requisite standard of care. The trial court determined that, as a matter of law, the attorney's advice did not fall below the standard of care. The Colorado Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The client worked as a nurse at the sheriff's department. She learned that she mistakenly gave an inmate the wrong medication, and the inmate brought suit. In the ensuing investigation, the inmate's medical record was discovered to have been altered. Approximately six months later, the state filed felony criminal charges against the client for forgery, tampering with evidence, and official misconduct. The client claimed that the attorney's advice that she not participate in an internal investigation was negligent because she had received use immunity through the sheriff's advisement. The supreme court held that the sheriff department's advisement that any statements the client made during an internal investigation could not later be used against her in a criminal proceeding did not constitute an enforceable offer of use immunity. When the attorney advised the client not to rely on the advisement; and the employee followed her attorney's advice, the apparent authority doctrine implying a grant of use immunity did not apply. The attorney's advice not to cooperate with the employer did not constitute malpractice because the employer's advisement was too ambiguous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents' sons had killed 12 students and a teacher at a high school. They then killed themselves. According to the sheriff's public report of the investigation it conducted of the murders, the recordings showed the sons plotting and preparing for the murders. In its initial opinion, the appellate court held that the recordings were subject to the Colorado Criminal Justice Records Act (CCJRA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-72-301 et seq. (2005). However, after a petition for rehearing, the appellate court reconsidered and held that the recordings were subject not to the CCJRA but to CORA. The instant court agreed with the newspaper that the records were subject to the CCJRA, not CORA. Because the sheriff obtained the recordings pursuant to a search warrant that had not been invalidated, and used them to investigate crimes connected with the killings, the instant court held that they were criminal justice records under the CCJRA and were subject to the sheriff's exercise of sound discretion to allow the requested inspection or not, utilizing a balancing test taking into account the relevant public and private interests.</SPAN></P>

The victim told the detective that defendant's behavior was bizarre. Defendant claimed that he was mentally slow. The appellate court held that an instruction giving the definition of insanity without naming it as such was reversible error. The court held that evidence offered to support a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity had a legally distinct purpose from evidence offered to negate a culpable mental state. Evidence offered to negate the culpable mental state was directed to disproving an essential element of the crime charged, as opposed to being offered to establish that defendant was mentally incapable of formulating the required mental state in the first instance. The court reversed, finding that while defense counsel argued consistently with the terms of Colorado's statutory affirmative defense of voluntary intoxication, that intoxication made it so that defendant did not have the ability to have specific intent and deliberation, defendant never argued that his mental slowness made him incapable of distinguishing right from wrong.</SPAN></P>

The Colorado Court of Appeals reversed his conviction, holding that a jury instruction constructively amended the charge of reckless child abuse resulting in death. The court of appeals also disapproved of the trial court's use of an obsolete version of the child abuse statute. The People sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was driving with his twin daughters, who were unrestrained, on his lap. Defendant attempted to pass a vehicle that was pulling a trailer. As defendant started to pass, the other vehicle began a left turn. The incident resulted in one child's death and in serious injuries to the other child. At issue on review was the trial court's use of an obsolete jury instruction. In using an obsolete instruction, the trial court informed the jury that it could convict defendant of reckless child abuse resulting in death if defendant had &quot;unreasonably placed his daughter in a situation that may have endangered&quot; her life or health. The operative phrase of the obsolete instruction, &quot;may have endangered,&quot; appeared in previous versions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6- 401(1)(a). The trial court committed plain and reversible error by failing to give an instruction that substantially conformed to the more recent version of the child abuse statute. The instruction's use exposed defendant to a conviction for an act that the jury could perceive as endangering the child's life or health but which did not cause his daughter's death, in other words, a nonexistent crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court upheld the judgment of the lower appellate court, which reversed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought review of decisions of the Colorado Court of Appeals, which affirmed defendants' convictions and held that juror questioning in defendants' cases did not violate their right to a fair trial and impartial jury and that, under the terms of the Colorado Jury Reform Pilot Project, which culminated in the adoption of Colo. R. Crim. P. 24(g), defendants were not prejudiced by the questions posed by the jurors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the presentation of the first defendant's case, defense counsel called an investigator from the district attorney's office to testify about inconsistent statements made by the victim and his girlfriend. After examination by the attorneys, the trial court asked a juror's question regarding how often a witness's story changed. The court held that the practice of allowing jurors to ask questions of witnesses through the trial court was not per se unconstitutional under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 16. The trial court erred in allowing the question because it called for irrelevant expert testimony. The witness was not qualified by the defense as an expert, and the answer had no bearing on the facts of defendant's case. The answer to the question was harmless, however, because one interpretation was that it was common for truthful witnesses to have inconsistent statements and the other was that the witnesses were lying. In the second defendant's trial, the defense and prosecution both agreed that a juror's question called for speculation. The court declined to find an error simply because the jury could have overheard a bench conference where no prejudicial statements were made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decisions of the court of appeals and remanded the cases to that court to return them to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Boulder County District Court (Colorado) that sustained his convictions for disrupting a lawful assembly in violation of Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. Defendant did not challenge the constitutionality of the disruption statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-108, but challenged its application to his case. The court held that &sect; 18-9-108 was constitutionally applied in this case because it was directed at conduct rather than content and the jury was instructed that it must find that defendant intended the disruption and that a significant disruption actually occurred. However, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to sustain defendant's conviction where there was no evidence that his conduct significantly disrupted the rally. The court held there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's obstruction conviction because the evidence showed that the officers reasonably believed that defendant had committed a crime and were justified in detaining him to issue a summons; and defendant's conduct, when viewed as a totality, constituted a knowing obstruction of that process. The court held that the trial court properly rejected defendant's requested instruction that his right to free expression was an affirmative defense to the disruption charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for obstructing a peace officer but reversed his conviction for disrupting a lawful assembly and remanded the case for further consistent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Colorado successfully petitioned for certiorari to review the judgment from the Court of Appeals (Colorado), which reversed defendant's convictions for the attempted second degree murder and first degree assault of his wife, finding that the trial court erred by not permitting defendant to proceed under his claimed affirmative defense of voluntary intoxication under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-804 (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was an insulin-dependent diabetic. Three days before the alleged crimes, his wife had told him she wanted a divorce and he moved out. In anticipation of eating cake and ice cream at his daughter's afternoon birthday party, he injected himself with a large dose of insulin. He did not eat anything following the injection. Later that morning, while he and his wife were running errands for the party, he hit her in the head with a hammer and ran her over with their van. Before his trial, the trial court denied his request to raise involuntary intoxication brought on by hypoglycemia as an affirmative defense. Because the trial court refused to permit him to proceed with this defense and instead ruled that the defense could only be presented with a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, the court of appeals reversed his conviction. On review, the court found that insanity and involuntary intoxication were separate and distinct defenses and that the medical condition of insulin-induced hypoglycemia could constitute the affirmative defense of involuntary intoxication. Accordingly, the court remanded to give both parties a chance to supplement the record on the asserted defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the part of the judgment that found that the trial court erred by not permitting defendant to proceed under his claimed affirmative defense of voluntary intoxication but reversed the judgment of reversal and remanded to the court of appeals with instructions to permit the trial court to permit both parties the opportunity to supplement the record on the issue of defendant's claimed involuntary intoxication defense.</SPAN></P>

The Jefferson County District Court (Colorado) reversed his conviction on grounds that his rights under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 23 were violated when the county court denied his demand for a jury of 12 and instead provided only a jury of six. The State sought certiorari review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After photographs of nude children and stolen property were found in defendant's possession, he was charged with two misdemeanors. Prior to trial, he demanded a jury of 12 pursuant to Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 23. The county court denied the request, finding that both Colo. R. Crim P. 23(a)(2) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-406(1) (2004) provided for a jury of six in misdemeanor cases. The district court reversed, finding that Const. art. II, &sect; 23 implicitly established a right to a jury of 12 in criminal cases. The supreme court disagreed. By looking to the jurisdiction of county and district courts as provided by the Colorado Constitution and the general assembly, the supreme court found there was right to a jury of 12 in felony cases that did not extend to misdemeanor cases. Thus, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-406(1) and Colo. R. Crim. P. 23 were constitutional under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Certiorari was granted to the court of appeals (Colorado), which affirmed the trial court's sentence, to consider whether Apprendi and Blakely invalidated the aggravated sentence imposed by the trial court against defendant where he was returned for sentencing on his deferred judgment for possession of a controlled substance after being convicted of vehicular homicide during the deferral period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had tested positive for drugs during his deferred sentence and drug treatment was unsuccessful. The trial court found a relationship between the original drug possession charge and the vehicular homicide incident involving alcohol, suggesting a pattern of conduct. The court held that defendant's aggravated sentence under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(6) (2004) was not unconstitutional. Defendant's Colo. R. Crim. P. 11 advisement notified him that he could be sentenced to 12 years if the judge found extraordinary aggravating circumstances present, but it alone did not authorize the judge's use of other facts defendant did not admit to aggravate the sentence. The court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(6) (2004) could be applied constitutionally, and that the prior conviction facts based on his convictions in the vehicular homicide case adequately support the aggravated sentence. Thus, under the circumstances of this case, the vehicular homicide convictions were proper Blakely-exempt aggravating factors for the possession sentence because the facts were reflected in a jury's verdict that was entered before the deferred possession sentence was imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution appealed a judgment of the Arapahoe County District Court (Colorado), which held that, because defendant could not have been constitutionally sentenced to death as of the last day of his trial and because the current sentencing scheme was unconstitutional, the prosecution could not seek the death penalty. The prosecution appealed the trial court's ruling to the instant court pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-12-102(1) (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to defendant's trial, the prosecution announced its intention to seek the death penalty. Three days into defendant's trial the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Arizona capital sentencing statute, which was similar to Colorado's statute, violated a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. In response, the Colorado legislature enacted Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.4-102(1)(e), which provided that if the prosecution announced by July 12, 2002, that it was seeking the death sentence, the sentence could still be determined by the trial judge. Defendant and one other person were the only two people to whom the provisions of that section could ever apply. The court upheld the district court's ruling that &sect; 18-1.4-102(1)(e) was unconstitutional on the grounds that it contravened the prohibition on special legislation in Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 25. The court noted that &sect; 18-1.4-102(1)(e) came within at least one enumerated prohibition in Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 25. The court also determined that a class that was drawn so that it would never have any members other than those targeted by the legislation was illusory and that &sect; 18-1.4-102(1)(e) created such a class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld the ruling of the district court and remanded for imposition of a life sentence without the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-11-1106(2) (2004). Petitioner real estate company made the claim for reformation against respondent public highway authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company was the assignee of a parcel of land that the original owner donated to the authority. The owner asserted that the authority agreed to return the land to the owner if it was not used as a highway, as intended by the parties. The authority did not use the land as a highway but did not return the land to the owner. In the company's original action against the authority, both the owner and the authority sought quiet title to the parcel. It was incumbent upon each party to raise any claims, issues, and defenses it may have had that would affect the adjudication of rights in the parcel. Not only could the owner have raised its statutory reformation claim as affecting its rights in the parcel, but the owner should have raised the claim because the claim directly involved the adjudication of its rights in the parcel as part of the quiet title claim. The court held that in absence of any clear intent to abrogate the common law doctrine of res judicata, &sect; 15-11-1106(2) did not provide an exception to res judicata such that the company could raise the statutory reformation claim in a subsequent judicial proceeding when the claim could have been raised in the previous action.</SPAN></P>

Appellant Washington County Board of Equalization disallowed the request.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The oil company operated 10 oil wells on six leasehold sites. The following issues were presented: (1) whether the further extraction and separating of crude oil from emulsion at an oil well lease converted the product from unprocessed to processed for purposes of valuing oil producing leaseholds; (2) whether an oil producer's price that was received at a sale at the leasehold should be the selling price at the wellhead for purpose of ad valorem taxes; (3) whether the term &quot;well site&quot; included the separation and storage facilities of crude oil located at or near the well bore for purposes of defining deductions for manufacturing/processing, gathering and transportation. The applicable constitutional and statutory provisions were Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3(1)(b) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-7-101(1)(d) (2004). The legislature intended &quot;wellhead&quot; to mean the physical location where the extracted material emerged. The general assembly implemented &sect; 39-7-101(1)(d) by basing tax assessment on a taxpayer's declaration of the selling price at the wellhead. The netback method for reporting selling price at the wellhead effectuated the intent of the constitutional and statutory provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted of murder in 1958 and brought his postconviction motion, claiming ineffective assistance of trial counsel, in 1995, after counsel died.

Stat. &sect; 16-5-402 (2004) did not impose an absolute statutory limitation on the period in which a defendant could bring a collateral attack against a class one felony, time bars could arise from application of the doctrine of laches. Trial courts had the flexibility to assess cases individually. In the case at bar, the record supported the laches finding. The inmate's conviction was affirmed in 1960, and since that time his life sentence had been commuted and he had been paroled three times. More than three decades after his conviction, and a mere eight months after his original defense counsel died, he filed a motion asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. The issue was available to him in the 1960's, and during his parole, he had the opportunity to contact counsel and pursue postconviction matters.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to the effective date of a 1999 amendment to the Workers Compensation Act, respondent employer provided petitioner employee a final admission of liability (FAL) that failed to provide notice of the new, retroactive time limit. Respondent Industrial Claim Appeals Office (ICAO) upheld the striking of the employee's division independent medical examiner (DIME) report as untimely. The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Amendments to the Act retroactively altered the timeline for a claimant's selection of a DIME. The court of appeals found that the effective date of the 1999 amendment was the triggering event for the new 30-day period. Based on that trigger, the employee failed to meet the deadline, even though the FAL gave no notice of the new time limit. On further review, the court reversed. The court reasoned that Colo. Div. of Workers' Comp. Rule IV(L)(3), 7 Colo. Code Regs. &sect; 1101-3 (2004), provided a procedure whereby employers or insurers could choose to provide amended notice to claimants with pre-amendment FALs in order to preserve their time-bar defenses to the selection of DIMEs. The court found that this procedure correctly emphasized the importance of administrative notice, while still providing a way to expedite particular open cases. The rule thus bridged the gap between the legislature's primary intent to expedite cases and its concern for adequate administrative notice. The employee did not receive any notice that would have triggered the 30-day time limit of the 1998 and 1999 amendments. Therefore, those time limits did not apply to his case and his DIME selection was timely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded with directions to reinstate the employee's claim and DIME report and to return the case to the administrative law judge for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer investigating suspicious activity followed two individuals into the back room of the liquor store. Other officers were called to the scene and, while standing in the back room, discovered bricks of marijuana. An officer seized a store surveillance video tape upon seeing defendant attempting to stuff it into his pants. The video showed defendant placing what officers believed to be bricks of marijuana in the back room. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized from the liquor store, finding that defendant had standing to assert Fourth Amendment protection on the basis of his reasonable expectation of privacy in the back room. The supreme court affirmed. Defendant, as the night manager and the sole person in control of the store, maintained a reasonable expectation of privacy from government intrusion in the back room of the store, an area without public access, such that he was entitled to assert the Fourth Amendment's protection. The use of a surveillance system reviewable only by the night manager and the owner of the store did not diminish his reasonable expectation of privacy from government intrusion.</SPAN></P>

The State made repeated assurances that both children would testify at trial, and the supreme court based its decision on those assurances. Because the hearsay declarants would be testifying at trial and would thus be subject to cross-examination, admission of their out-of-court statements did not violate the Confrontation Clause.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner was injured when he attempted to dive into an above-ground pool on the premises. The court of appeals held that respondents had no duty to warn of the open and obvious danger of diving into an above-ground swimming pool. The court held that the language of the premises liability statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-311-15 (2004) evidenced the general assembly's intent to establish a comprehensive and exclusive specification of the duties landowners owed to those injured on their property. The plain language preempted prior common law theories of liability, and established the statute as the sole codification of landowner duties in tort. The court concluded that the open and obvious danger doctrine was not intended to be one of the defenses to the existence of a landowner's duties. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals stating that it erroneously considered respondents' common law open and obvious danger defense and that summary judgment was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Colorado Court of Appeals dismissed defendant's appeal from the district court's judgment convicting him of driving under the influence of alcohol for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-6-310 (2004) provided that further appeal from the final judgment of a district court, in a case appealed from a county court, was only by writ of certiorari. The supreme court granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court granted certiorari to determine whether the court of appeals erred in rejecting defendant's appeal on the grounds that his only remedy was to request a writ of certiorari issued in the discretion of the supreme court. The supreme court noted that, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-6-310(2), as well as under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-12-101, the defendant did not have an appeal as of right from a judgment of the district court that only modified the county court judgment. The supreme court read Colo. R. Crim. P. 37(h) to provide that, only in cases tried de novo by the district court would the district court judgment be subject to direct appeal. While the defendant's appeal as of a right from county to district court was satisfied when the district court acted in its appellate capacity, that right was not satisfied when the district court entered the judgment from a trial de novo. Because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-12-101 granted defendant at least one appeal from the proceeding resulting in his conviction, that appeal as of right meant a direct appeal to an appellate tribunal, which was the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a high profile sexual assault case, the District Court for Eagle County, Colorado, issued an order directing the destruction of transcriptions of in camera proceedings. Seven media entities filed a petition, asking that the state supreme court exercise jurisdiction to review the district court's order and set it aside as an unconstitutional prior restraint against publication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This criminal prosecution for sexual assault received extraordinary media attention, fueled by defendant's reputation as an all-star professional basketball player. The district court maintained an electronic scheduling archive on the Colorado Courts' webpage containing links to publicly accessible documents. The district court issued an order that in camera proceedings involving rape shield evidence and transcripts of them were not to be made publicly accessible. The court reporter mistakenly transmitted the transcribed in camera proceedings for June 21 and 22, 2004, along with the transcribed public proceedings for June 21, to recipients preparing news stories. The district court signed an order June 24, 2004, preventing further release of the contents of the in camera transcripts. The Supreme Court of Colorado upheld the district court's order as a constitutional form of prior restraint. The State had an interest in providing a confidential evidentiary proceeding under the rape shield statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. tit. 6, &sect; 18-3-407 (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court's prohibition against revealing the contents of the transcribed in camera proceedings of June 21 and 22, 2004, was upheld. The portion of the district court's order requiring the recipients to delete the electronic transmission and destroy all copies of the in camera transcripts was stricken. The district court was ordered to make its determinations regarding the evidence it heard in the rape shield in camera proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent assistant attorney regulation counsel appealed a decision from the (Colorado) Presiding Disciplinary Judge (PDJ), which, pursuant to an attorney's motion, found that the counsel violated Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An attorney told the assistant counsel who was investigating his noncompliance with his child support duty that the measures he had taken to comply with his duty was to apply for Social Security retirement that would go to his son. Because the attorney did not obtain a court modification of his child support order even after the counsel told him to, the counsel filed a complaint alleging a Colo. R. Prof. Conduct 8.4(c) violation in his forms. The attorney obtained a directed verdict and filed a motion for Colo. R. Civ. P. 11 sanctions against the attorney, and the PDJ found that the counsel violated Rule 11. On appeal, the court held that because the counsel sought and obtained information from the attorney, had her investigator obtain court records and interview the attorney's child's mother, and conducted legal research on the issues, the counsel complied with her Rule 11 duty to investigate the matter. Because the counsel presented the facts to the Colorado Attorney Regulation Committee, which authorized the complaint, and because the complaint did not state that the attorney knowingly violated Colo. R. Prof. Conduct 8.4(c), the counsel did not violate Colo. R. Civ. P. 11.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, minor child and parents, sought review of the decision of the Adams County District Court (Colorado), which found in favor of defendant hospital, holding that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-64-205(1)(f) (2001) of the Health Care Availability Act (HCAA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-64-101 et seq., was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother gave birth to a son on September 2, 1996 and as a result, the mother suffered severe pelvic damage during the delivery and the son incurred severe cerebral palsy from birth trauma.

The supreme court reversed the trial court's judgment in part, stating that the trial court erred in determining that the periodic payment provision of the HCAA was unconstitutional. The trial court was instructed to order periodic payment of the child's future damages, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-64-203 (2003). The son did not meet the criteria set forth in Colo. Rev.

The District Court of the City and County of Denver, Colorado, concluded that the Pilot Program was unconstitutional as it interfered with the local school districts' discretion to allocate their funding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the Governor contended the local control provisions of Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 15 did not place any impediment in the way of the general assembly's power to enact the Pilot Program. The supreme court disagreed, finding that the Pilot Program did violate the local control requirements of &sect; 15 because it directed the school districts to turn over a portion of their locally-raised funds to nonpublic schools over whose instruction the districts had no control. Irrespective of the fact that the goals of the program and the policy considerations underlying it were laudable, the supreme court could see no way to reconcile the structure of the program with the requirements of the Colorado Constitution. To hold otherwise would have rendered the local control provisions of &sect; 15 meaningless. As such, the trial court properly found that the Pilot Program was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court reversed a constitutional challenge to a ballot issue approved by voters raising taxes to allow a cost-of-living increase for the school district. He filed his action nearly four months after the election seeking to overturn the election, arguing that the ballot title and the notice sent to voters violated Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20. The school district court countered that the taxpayer's claims were time-barred by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-11-203.5 (2003). The trial court ruled in favor of the school district on the merits and the appellate court transferred the case to the supreme court, which affirmed the trial court's decision not to overturn the election. Section &sect; 1-11-203.5 was constitutional and its time limits were reasonable and were carefully crafted to avoid a conflict with the State constitution. All of the taxpayer's justiciable claims were time-barred either by &sect; 1-11-203.5 or by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-11-213 (2003), which required a claimant who contested the result of an election to filed a written statement of intent within 10 days of the filing of the official survey of returns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners argued, inter alia, that they were entitled to $ 197,000 in cash in addition to the surplus of $ 197,000 in special benefits received. However, under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 15, the landowners were entitled to receive the value of which they were deprived and &quot;just compensation&quot; was not synonymous with a cash payment. The landowners received the compensation to which they were entitled. As a result of the taking, they were owed $ 1,323,691 for the property actually taken and $ 100,000 for damages to their remaining property, which came to a total of $ 1,423,691. As compensation, they received a cash payment of $ 1,126,691 and $ 297,000 in special benefits, for a total of $ 1,423,691 received. Thus, the landowners received the value of which they had been deprived. Therefore, the trial court's application of Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, juveniles, were all adjudicated juvenile delinquents and charged with felony escape, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-208(2) (2003). The Weld County District Court, Colorado, found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-210.1 (2003) violated Colo. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4 by impermissibly modifying the definition of &quot;felony.&quot; A rule to show cause was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court reasoned that adjudication as a juvenile did not qualify as a felony under the Colorado Constitution, and therefore a juvenile adjudication could not provide the basis for a subsequent felony charge under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-208(2). The reviewing court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-210.1 did not conflict with Colo. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 4, because the statute's sole effect was to criminalize escape when it was committed by an adjudicated juvenile delinquent who was confined because he committed an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult. The power to criminalize such conduct lied firmly within the purview of the Colorado Legislature, and, absent a constitutional infirmity, there was no basis to interfere with that power, Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-210.1 did not re-classify adjudicated delinquents as felons. Rather, it authorized the State to bring felony escape charges against a sub-set of juvenile offenders who committed acts that, if committed by an adult, would have been a felony. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-210.1 did not deem this sub-set of adjudicated juvenile offenders felons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, state employees and their associations, filed suit against respondents, the Governor of Colorado and the Personnel Director in their official capacities, in an attempt to contest a new policy strictly limiting automatic payroll deductions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-50-104(8) did not define which deductions were state-sponsored for all state employees, and thus statutorily entitled to automatic deductions. The Governor by Executive Order designated the Colorado Combined Campaign as the only entity state-sponsored for all state employees and thus, the only non-statutory program to be exempted from executive review and approval. In response to the Executive Order, the Personnel Director issued a payroll deduction policy, cancelling all automatic deductions except those authorized by statute or executive order and those repaying money owed to the state. The reviewing court held that petitioners had standing to challenge the payroll deduction policy. Petitioners alleged injuries sufficient to satisfy the injury-in-fact prong of the standing test when they alleged that they were using a state-provided service, but were now precluded from doing so by a change in government policy and practice. Also, petitioners were deprived of the right to even be considered for a payroll deduction, satisfying the legally protected interest prong of the standing test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both the trial court and the court of appeals found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-25-127(1), which required a preponderance standard in &quot;civil cases,&quot; applied to a motion to set aside a default judgment and therefore replaced the common law burden of clear and convincing proof. The court disagreed. The term &quot;civil action&quot; was limited to substantive actions. A motion for the setting aside of a default judgment was procedural and therefore subject to the court's power to promulgate rules governing procedural matters. Thus, the common law standard, not &sect; 13-25-127, applied. As a matter of judicial economy, the court addressed the issue of whether defendant had met the greater burden based on the trial court's factual findings and found that she had. Defendant presented clear, strong, and satisfactory proof that she was not served. The only evidence of service was a return signed by a deputy, who was inconsistent at best. Conversely, the trial court found no reason to doubt defendant's claim that she was not served. She had no incentive to deny service, given her insurance company's participation, and her insurance representative corroborated her testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-401(1)(7)(a)(III) (2003). The Colorado Court of Appeals reversed his conviction on the basis that the trial court instructed the jury on two alternative theories of culpability for the crime and the evidence did not support both of those theories beyond a reasonable doubt. The court granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury was presented with evidence that defendant shook his girlfriend's baby, that he was aware of the seriousness of its resulting medical condition, and that he failed to seek or prevented medical treatment. He did not dispute the sufficiency of the evidence that he knowingly or recklessly caused serious bodily injury to the baby. There was also sufficient evidence, under the alternative theory on which the jury was charged, that, by failing to seek treatment, defendant permitted the baby to be unreasonably placed in a situation posing a threat of injury. However, the evidence was insufficient on that theory to find that the failure to seek treatment resulted in further injury. The court nevertheless affirmed the conviction, overruling a prior decision. The court held that, where the evidence was otherwise sufficient to support a determination of guilt, it did not violate the due process clause of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25 to provide the jury with an instruction containing a factually insufficient theory of liability for the same charged offense. The court also held that the decision to admit expert testimony on the force associated with subdural hematoma was not plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder. The State filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-1201(3) (2003). Defendant filed a notice of mental retardation, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-1102(1). The Adams County District Court, Colorado, declared the statute unconstitutional. The State filed a petition for a rule to show cause. The rule was issued, and the parties briefed the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's first-degree murder charge involved the death of his wife. The trial court declared Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-1102&nbsp;unconstitutional, because it required defendant to prove mental retardation by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the trial court at a pre-trial proceeding. The trial court found that the statute impermissibly placed on defendant the burden of proving his mental retardation. To cure that problem, the trial court ordered the State to prove that defendant was not mentally retarded by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant argued that the prohibition announced in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Atkins v. Virginia, could not be sustained by requiring him to bear the burden of proof concerning the fact of mental retardation. Defendant insisted that the State must prove his lack of mental retardation beyond a reasonable doubt. The reviewing court ruled that the standard of proof required under the statute was constitutionally permissible. Imposing upon defendant the burden of proving his mental retardation by clear and convincing evidence for the purpose of capital punishment offended no constitutional mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents, a district attorney, a board of county commissioners, and two voters, and petitioner Colorado Secretary of State filed a joint petition for a writ of certiorari to challenge a decision from the Pueblo County District Court (Colorado), which determined that district attorneys were subject to the term limits set forth in Colo. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 11(1), and that the board had authority to refer a term limit measure to the voters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Colo. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 11(1) limited the term of certain officials in Colorado. The Secretary informed the district attorney that he was unable to run for office again because he had already been in office for 20 years. Thereafter, the district attorney, the board, and the voters filed a declaratory action against the Secretary. When the district court determined that the district attorney was subject to the term limits under &sect; 11(1) and that the board was permitted to submit the matter to the voters, both parties sought review. In affirming, the court determined that district attorneys were &quot;nonjudicial elected officials&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 11(1), and were subject to the term limits of &sect; 11(1). The provision of &sect; 11 which allowed the voters to modify or eliminate term limits for a particular office was self-executing, requiring no further action by the legislature for implementation. Thus, because the boundaries of the judicial district and the county were coextensive, with identical electors, the board validly referred a measure to the voters of the judicial district regarding the elimination of term limits for their district attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by terminating her parental rights. The supreme court disagreed. Testimony showed that the mother had lived at 13 different places in a year's time, either in a motel or with friends or family. At the time of the hearing, the mother was not working and had not had stable employment since the case began - approximately two and a half years. The mother discontinued her drug and alcohol monitoring and her failure to obtain stable housing and employment represented a failure to comply with the recommendations of the psychological evaluation. Expert testimony established that the mother's permanent psychological state was such that she would likely never be emotionally intimate with her children and that she failed to demonstrate any ability to keep a safe, secure home for her children or herself. The mother's inability to trust others severely inhibited her capacity to seek the help she needed to become a fit parent. While the evidence showed that the mother tried to improve her situation, she had had little success during the crucial treatment period, which was the best indicator of the mother's future ability to parent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot and killed her boyfriend. At the crime scene and at the hospital, defendant refused to answer any questions regarding the shooting. At trial, defendant raised the defense of not guilty by reason of insanity. To prove that she was sane at the time of the crime under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-105.5(2) (2003), the People presented evidence of defendant's pre-arrest silence. Defendant sought review after she was convicted of first degree murder. An appellate court reversed the conviction, and the People sought review. In affirming the appellate court's decision, the court determined that evidence of defendant's pre-arrest silence was not admissible. The fact that defendant was unable to respond to questioning was so lacking in probative value that it was inadmissible under Colo. R. Evid. 401. She may have been unable to respond due to a lack of memory, confusion, disorientation, or the pain of her own gunshot wounds. Further, the unfair prejudicial impact far outweighed any possible probative value, rendering the evidence also inadmissible under Colo. R. Evid. 403. Finally, the admission of the evidence did not amount to a harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The attorney general filed the instant action requesting an injunction to prevent implementation of the new plan. In response, the secretary of state requested dismissal of the attorney general's petition, claiming that he could not bring an original proceeding of that type. The court issued a rule to show cause in both cases and made the rule absolute in the attorney general's case. The court first held that the attorney general had authority to sue the secretary, because the resolution of the redistricting plan dispute was a matter of great public importance. The court further held that U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, granted only limited authority to the state for congressional redistricting and that Colo. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with unlawful use of marihuana in a detention facility, in violation of section Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-406.5 (2003). The District Court, Chaffee County (Colorado), found that the statute violated defendant's equal protection rights and granted defendant's motion to dismiss the prosecution. The People appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court agreed with defendant that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-406.5 (2003) was unconstitutional, as it imposed a higher punishment on marihuana users than it did on users of more serious drugs. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the lack of an addiction treatment option under &sect; 18-18-406.5 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25, even though the treatment option was available for users of drugs considered to be more dangerous to society. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-404 (2002), which provided the treatment option, specifically excluded marihuana offenses. Therefore, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-406.5 (2003) was directly related to the legislature's purpose of punishing those who used marihuana in a detention facility. Defendant failed to show that the statute was based on an arbitrary distinction not based on real differences. The court noted that symmetry of punishment was not required. The court also noted that the classification of treating marihuana crimes differently was rationally based on real differences between the substances. Therefore, the lack of a treatment option for marihuana offenses was not completely arbitrary or irrational.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While investigating misconduct allegations against respondent attorney, petitioner Attorney Regulation Counsel (ARC) subpoenaed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) documents and provided copies to the attorney. The attorney publicly disclosed the documents, which implicated third parties named in the documents. The presiding disciplinary judge (PDJ) issued a protective order, and both the ARC and the attorney sought to have the order vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the ARC argued that the order misconstrued the ARC's obligations when the investigative subpoena was issued, that it overextended the concept of confidentiality in Colo. R. Civ. P. 251.31, and that it hindered the ARC's investigation of the attorney. The attorney also filed a motion for leave to intervene in support of the ARC's petition, arguing that the protective order violated his First Amendment right to free speech. The supreme court held that the attorney, who was the target of the investigation, was a &quot;party&quot; to the investigative proceedings. As such, the ARC had to provide the attorney with notice of the subpoenas and copies of the subpoenaed documents. The PDJ's protective order directing that the documents subpoenaed from the FBI be treated as confidential was proper. The supreme court further held that, under both the two-pronged balancing test of Seattle Times and the &quot;good cause&quot; showing required under Colo. R. Civ. P. 251.31(e), the protective order did not violate the attorney's First Amendment rights. However, the protective order had to be modified, as it unduly hindered both the ARC and attorney's ability to further their respective cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Four initiatives were proposed to the Board. The purpose of the initiatives was to liberalize the procedure for initiative and referendum petitions. They contained a provision that excluded lawyers from membership on the Board. The Board refused to set title for two of the initiatives after finding that they violated Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(5.5) because they contained more than one subject. Titles were set for the other two initiatives after the wording was changed. The challengers then filed an action to challenge the Board's decision. On review, the court determined that all four initiatives violated &sect; 1(5.5) because they contained more than one subject. However, the court based its decision on broader grounds. The court found that the initiatives limited the substantive political rights of all attorneys. This right was impacted in situations in which one specifically identifiable group of individuals was prohibited from seeking to enact protective legislation. The prohibition did not have a necessary or proper connection to the purpose of the proposed measures. As such, the Board should not have set titles on any of the proposed initiatives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a DUI case, the Pueblo County District Court (Colorado) ruled that blood test results would not be admitted without the testimony of a lab technician. The county court also held Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-309(5)(2002) was not applicable in a trial for a DUI charge. On appeal, the district court ruled that the statute applied to all criminal cases where laboratory tests were required. The State petitioned for certiorari review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Supreme Court of Colorado granted certiorari in this DUI case to consider two issues: first, whether Colo.

The court concluded that &sect; 16-3-309(5) did apply in a DUI case and was constitutional on its face, as it did not infringe upon a defendant's confrontation rights. Under &sect; 16-3-309(5), a defendant wishing to confront the technician who prepared the report could do so by notifying the prosecution, at least 10 days before trial, that he wanted the technician present at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed, as to application of the statute allowing criminalistics laboratory reports to be admitted at trial without the testimony of the lab technician in a DUI proceeding.

The trial court rejected defendant's argument that Colo. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 18-18-404(1) (2002), prohibiting use of a controlled substance. Defendant had pled guilty to possession of cocaine. The supreme court affirmed the appellate court's decision, stating that defendant's sentence under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-405(1)(a), the possession statute, did not offend equal protection. Section 18-18-405(1)(a), prohibiting possession of a controlled substance, and Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a discipline proceeding, the Colorado Attorney Regulation Counsel (ARC) investigated allegations regarding respondent attorney. Both matters concerned, in part, statements the attorney made, asserting that two Colorado judges had purchased and used cocaine. The presiding disciplinary judge (PDJ) issued a protective order to prevent public disclosure of discovery materials. The ARC and the attorney petitioned to have the order vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A witness stated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had investigated both judges, and had evidence of the judges' cocaine use. Because the attorney was entitled to the documents themselves as a &quot;party&quot; to the proceedings, ARC forwarded him copies that had been redacted by the FBI. The attorney then publicly distributed the FBI documents, by filing them in various courts of record. The appellate court held that the attorney, who was the target of the investigation, was a &quot;party&quot; to the investigative proceedings. Because Colorado rules governing discovery by the ARC incorporated certain provisions of the rules of civil procedure, the ARC had to provide the target attorney with notice of the subpoenas and copies of the subpoenaed documents. However, the PDJ's protective order limiting further dissemination of the documents involving the two judges was appropriate. Under Seattle Times and the &quot;good cause&quot; showing required under Colo. R. Civ. P. 251.31(e), the protective order did not violate the attorney's First Amendment rights. The PDJ was required to modify the protective order to allow the limited use of the FBI documents by both parties, the attorney and the ARC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The rule was made absolute in part and discharged in part, and the case was remanded to the disciplinary judge with directions to modify the protective order consistent with the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by improperly determining that it breached the settlement agreement. The supreme court disagreed. The plain language of the contract identified the behavior of each party in relation to when the company filed its tariffs. Therefore it was not necessary that the agreement specifically stated that the tariffs must be filed. The language of the agreement did not say &quot;if&quot; the company filed tariffs, the district could not object to an application for an extension of time in which to do so. Rather, the district agreed not to object to an extension of time up to December 31, 1996, within which the company would file tariffs. The company breached the settlement agreement, as it failed to timely file the tariffs. Further, the company could not rely on the agreement, as it repudiated the agreement by informing the district that it would not be filing tariffs at all. The company materially breached the contract not only by seeking another extension of time beyond the December 31, 1996, deadline, but also by filing the tariffs beyond the December 31, 1996, deadline. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district court certified a class of injured indigent employees and struck down Colo. Rev.

Code Regs. 1101-3 as unconstitutional on due process and equal protection grounds. The appellate court determined that, once the employer admitted liability, the Act entitled the employee to property interests that included temporary benefits and medical treatment. The fee requirement violated the Fourteenth Amendment, as the employees were denied any opportunity to be heard before they were deprived of the benefits and treatment. There was a high degree of hardship imposed by the termination on indigent employees. The group got no opportunity for an independent evaluation, no benefit of the statutory presumptions accorded to the evaluation, no administrative hearing, no administrative appeals, and no right to appeal to the court system. It was unclear how providing evidentiary hearings to indigent employees to protect their statutory property rights imposed additional costs or burdens on the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of three counts of aggravated robbery. The Colorado Court of Appeals reversed one of the convictions on the grounds that two of the charges were multiplicitous. The State appealed. Defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court properly dismissed one of the counts as multiplicitous, as he committed only one aggravated robbery during the first incident, as there was only one violent taking of property from a common owner. The supreme court disagreed. Both clerks, who were counting the money in the cash register, had sufficient control over the store's property when defendant brandished a hatchet and demanded money from the register. Defendant directed threats to both employees when he sought and obtained control over the store's money. While it was the second clerk who handed over the money, the property was taken from the presence of the first clerk, who would have been able to retain control over it but for the threats by defendant to the second clerk. Because the common property taken from the second clerk was also taken from the presence of another, the first clerk, the robber's acts constituted different offenses as to each victim. Therefore, the judgments of conviction for both clerks were not multiplicitous, as defendant was being punished for two separate offenses, or the robbery of each clerk, and not for the same offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed on the issue of defendant's multiple counts and convictions arising from a single incident. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, Colorado Department of Revenue, challenged the judgment of the Colorado Court of Appeals, holding that respondent, driver, had to be convicted of a driving offense committed while the driver's operating license was revoked before the Department could extend the driver's license revocation under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-138(3) (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver failed to appear at the scheduled revocation hearing, and the Department revoked his license for three months. During this time, the driver was driving when another vehicle rear-ended him. The driver was ticketed for driving under restraint, and at the end of the initial revocation period, the Department issued the driver a new driver's license. However, after receiving the accident report, the Department revoked the driver's operating license for an additional year. The appellate court construed Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-138(3) to prohibit the department from revoking the license of a driver who drove while his license was under restraint. The appellate court required, as a condition for extension or renewal of revocation, that the driver be actually convicted of another driving offense or violation. The reviewing court ruled that the Department, upon receiving the accident report for a person who was driving under revocation, could impose an additional period of revocation under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-138(3), after finding that the person was driving under restraint at the time of the accident.</SPAN></P>

Because the legislature empowered the Commissioner to do whatever was necessary to accomplish the conversion, the supreme court held that the Commissioner could award attorney fees under the common fund doctrine, where there was no legislative abrogation of the common law right; the legislature did not otherwise prohibit an award of fees; and the participation of the attorneys, representing the general public interest, was necessary to effectuate the conversion. On remand, the Commissioner had to determine: whether the attorneys' efforts were necessary to effectuate the conversion and substantially responsible for enhancing the consideration paid; whether a percentage-based award of fees was appropriate; and whether the attorneys should receive compensation for nonpecuniary benefits to the conversion process.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the use of a three-judge panel to impose a death sentence was unconstitutional under the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Ring v. Arizona, which held that only a jury could find an aggravating circumstance necessary to raise the maximum punishment for an offense from life to death. The death sentences had to be reversed. The court could not use the discretion granted to it by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.4-102 (2002) to remand the cases to the trial courts for resentencing before a jury because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-105(5) (2002) (now Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-405 (2002)), which was in effect at the time of the original sentencing, mandated imposition of a life sentence without parole.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated appeal, petitioners, former spouses of the decedents, sought a writ of certiorari to the Colorado Court of Appeals challenging its finding in favor of respondent estates in the application of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-11-804(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former spouses argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-11-804(2) did not apply to revoke revocable rights granted during a marriage that dissolved before the statute became effective and one ex-spouse died after that effective date. The appellate court found that the plain language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-17-102 (2001) indicated the legislature's intent that the death of a decedent on or after the date the statute became effective triggered its application, notwithstanding that the insurance contract may have been entered into, and the divorce may have occurred, before the statute's effective date; the statute would be retroactive under such circumstances. The retroactive application of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-11-804(2) was not retrospective with regard to the beneficiaries' interests. The decedents could expect that their life insurance policies would be regulated by statute. The spouses did not have a contract clause claim because they were not parties to the contract, but third-party beneficiaries. Because the statute only addressed the donative aspect of the insurance contract, the contract between the decedents and the insurance companies was not impaired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of reckless second degree assault with a deadly weapon in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-203(1)(d) (2001). The Colorado Court of Appeals held that the conviction violated defendant's equal protection rights under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25, because it imposed a more severe penalty for the same behavior proscribed by the vehicular assault statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-205(1)(a) (2001). The court granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of reckless second degree assault after he ran over the victim with his vehicle, which put the victim in a coma. The court found no equal protection violation because the court concluded that the statutes for reckless second degree assault and vehicular assault proscribed different conduct. The vehicular assault statute was limited to acts concerning a vehicle, and both statutes differed in terms of causation. The trial court did not commit reversible error in failing to give the jury an intervening cause instruction because the facts did not warrant the instruction. The act of defendant in driving forward and running over the victim's head was the actus reus for which defendant was convicted, and the victim's prior act of jumping on the car did not cause defendant's subsequent act of running over him. While the trial court erred in allowing an investigating officer to testify as an expert without complying with Colo. R. Evid. 702, the error was harmless because the officer's testimony was corroborated and did not result in any unfairness in the trial. The trial court was entitled to consider defendant's appeal bond without waiting for a limited remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment that defendant's conviction violated his equal protection rights, and reinstated the conviction. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision that the appeal bond was properly heard by the trial court without a limited remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant failed to appear at his trial, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was thereafter arrested in another county on the warrant. While in custody, and without being given Miranda warnings, defendant made incriminating statements that he knew there was a warrant for his arrest. At trial, defendant did not testify, but his wife testified he possessed poor cognitive ability and therefore did not know about the hearing. The State impeached defendant's wife's statement with defendant's incriminating statements. Defendant was convicted, and the court of appeals reversed, holding the admission of his custodial statements was constitutional error. The supreme court initially noted when impeaching with a prior inconsistent statement, it was axiomatic that the prior inconsistent statements needed to belong to the testifying witness. The supreme court held a defendant's voluntary, unwarned, custodial statements could only be used to impeach the defendant, if he testified at trial, and, if the defendant did not testify at trial, such unwarned custodial statements could not be used either to rebut a defense theory or to impeach a witness other than the defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A patient sustained injuries while he was receiving treatment at a hospital. He initiated a medical malpractice action against the hospital and two physicians as he was left incapacitated. Before trial, the patient settled with his treating physician. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the non-treating physician. Following trial against the hospital, the jury rendered judgment in favor of the patient. The state supreme court granted certiorari to review several legal issues in the case. The state supreme court concluded as follows: (1) The patient did not waive his right to appeal by accepting attorney's fees as a result of the judgment against the hospital; (2) the non-treating physician still owed the patient a common law duty of reasonable care; and (3) Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-64-205, which provided that the patient, as an incapacitated person, could not elect to receive future medical and non-economic damages in a lump-sum payment, did not violate equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 16-11-309(1)(a) (2001). He requested a proportionality review of his sentence. The trial court declined to conduct a proportionality review of defendant's 60-year sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After reviewing federal and state case law discussing the issue of proportionality review of a defendant's sentence, the supreme court concluded that a criminal defendant who was sentenced under the crime of violence statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-309(1)(a) (2001), was entitled, upon request, to an abbreviated proportionality review of his sentences. If, and only if, that abbreviated proportionality review gave rise to an inference of gross disproportionality would an extended proportionality review be required. Given the gravity and seriousness of the crimes included in the crime of violence statute, the necessity of conducting an extended proportionality review and thus a successful challenge to a sentence imposed under that statute would be exceedingly rare. The supreme court found that the trial court and the court of appeals were authorized to conduct a proportionality review of defendant's sentences; however, the supreme court held that the sentences imposed were not grossly disproportionate to the offenses and affirmed the judgments and sentences imposed.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that a defendant was entitled, upon request, to an abbreviated proportionality review of a sentence under the habitual criminal statute as amended in 1993, even when the sentence imposed was less than a life sentence. Thus, in the instant case, defendant was entitled to an abbreviated proportionality review.

The officials appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue in this case was whether the notice-of-claim provisions of the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA), applied to a claim against the university officials sued in their individual capacities for retaliation under FLSA. The officials argued that the employee's FLSA retaliation claim was barred by sovereign immunity because it was really a claim against the state and the officials were only nominal defendants. The employee argued that she sued the officials in their individual capacities for their willful and wanton retaliatory conduct, and not as nominal defendants. The employee claimed that the officials did not enjoy sovereign immunity. The instant court held that the officials did not enjoy sovereign immunity because they were sued in their individual capacities and relief was sought from them personally. The CGIA's notice-of-claim provisions were intended to apply to such claims despite the lack of sovereign immunity. However, because the FLSA preempted the notice-of-claim provisions, the notice-of-claim provisions did not apply to the employee's claim against the officials in their individual capacities for retaliation under the FLSA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff bookstore brought suit, seeking to restrain defendant city's police from executing a search warrant of the bookstore. The District Court of the City and County of Denver, Colorado, granted a restraining order with respect to a request for a criminal suspect's 30-day purchasing history, but it allowed the police to discover information related to a mailing envelope found in the suspects' garbage. The bookstore appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This case required the instant court to decide what test should be applied to balance the constitutional rights of individuals and bookstores against the duty of law enforcement officials to investigate crime. The bookstore argued that it should not be required to disclose any information regarding customer purchase records. The city argued that the information sought was necessary: (1) to prove that the operator of an illicit drug lab acted with the level of intent necessary to secure a conviction; (2) to prove the identity of the perpetrator; and (3) to &quot;connect&quot; a suspect to the drug lab. The instant court held that the Colorado Constitution required that the bookstore, as an innocent bookseller, be afforded an opportunity for an adversarial hearing prior to execution of a search warrant seeking customer purchase records. Applying a balancing test, the instant court concluded that the search warrant in this case was not enforceable and should not have issued. The city failed to demonstrate that its need for the customer purchase record was sufficiently compelling to outweigh the harm that would have been caused to constitutional interests, if the search warrant were executed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The instant court reversed the judgment of the district court, with respect to the police request for information related to the books mailed in the envelope found in the suspects' garbage. The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the instant court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The State Democratic Party filed an action in the district court to begin the court process of redistricting. The district court allowed seventeen parties to intervene. The district court issued its ruling adopting a map created by Republican leaders. Members of the Democratic Party appealed, alleging the Republican map violated equal protection rights. On review, the state supreme court considered whether the redistricting map in effect diluted minority voting strength contrary to the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1971 (1988). Upon determining the case was ripe for adjudication, the state supreme court determined that the process utilized by the district court in adopting a redistricting plan was thorough, inclusive, and non-partisan. The approximately 3 percent drop in the Hispanic population of District 1 did not give rise to a finding of unconstitutional voter dilution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was granted an absolute surface water right, based upon an historical appropriation for irrigation.

A year and a half later, plaintiff, claiming to be a party entitled to receive mailed notice of the action, filed its petition alleging: (1) its failure to protest the application was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect; (2) the legal description of the historically irrigated property submitted by defendant included plaintiff's property; and (3) the stock pond was actually located on plaintiff's property. The supreme court held that it was unnecessary to determine whether the due process requirement of reasonable notice was satisfied to give the water court personal jurisdiction over plaintiff. Under the circumstances, plaintiff's failure to protest in a timely manner was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-92-304 (2001).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners home-rule municipalities challenged whether certain provisions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-4-110.5 and 42-3-112(14) (2001) regulating the use of automated vehicle identification systems (AVIS), popularly known as photo radar and photo red light, unconstitutionally infringed on their powers under Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect;6. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the provisions. The municipalities appealed by writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Affirming the trial court, the supreme court held that the regulation of AVIS to enforce traffic laws was a matter of mixed local and state concern, and it held that the challenged provisions of &sect;&sect; 42-4-110.5 and 42-3-112(14) were not superseded by the cities' local ordinances or charters. The constitutionality of the challenged provisions were upheld. Without uniform state legislation, drivers might have been subject to a significant variety of conflicting local legislation, further increasing the potential for confusion and substantially affecting their expectations. Important to the supreme court's uniformity analysis was the fact that cities wishing to ticket traffic violators using automated systems must access those drivers' names and addresses through the state motor vehicle registration office. Thus, a certain level of cooperation between a city and the state was necessary to make the system work. The need for cooperation between cities and the state was an important factor in the supreme court's analysis. Thus, the regulation of automated vehicle identification systems affected the residents of the state as a whole, as opposed to simply affecting local residents.</SPAN></P>

Upon its review, the appellate court held that the Adopted Plan did not comply with the criteria of Colo. Const. art.

Defendant operators of a senior water right placed calls to curtail the diversions.

The District Court for Water Division No. 2 dismissed the complaint and issued an injunction ordering cessation of the diversions. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">For over 12 years, the association diverted water to fill ponds for recreational use by residents of a subdivision. Although it made diversions under periodic approvals by the state engineer, it failed to initiate a water court augmentation plan proceeding. The operators of the senior water right placed frequent calls upon the association's pond-filling activities. On appeal of the injunction curtailing its out-of-priority diversions, the association contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-80-120, when combined with the state engineer's approval of its out-of-priority diversions, conferred upon it a legally protected water right. The appellate court held that the association lacked standing to invoke the enlargement or futile call doctrines against the operators of the senior water right, as their out-of-priority diversions required a judicially decreed augmentation plan that authorized them. The state engineer's enforcement discretion under &sect; 37-80-120 did not alleviate the duty of the association to obtain a decree for an augmentation plan. The water court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining the association's diversions pending adjudication authorizing them.</SPAN></P>

The district filed a motion to dismiss, or alternatively a motion for summary judgment. The district court granted the district's motion. The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the school did not have standing. The school appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court addressed several issues, inter alia: (1) whether the school could sue the school district to enforce its service agreement contract; and (2) whether the school could sue the school district to enforce governing policy provisions in its charter contract. The supreme court held that: (1) Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-30.5-104(7)(b) expressly authorized the school to sue the district for enforcement of its services contract created pursuant to &sect; 22-30.5-104(7)(b), therefore, because the services at issue were clearly controlled by &sect; 22-30.5-104(7)(b), the school had standing to sue for enforcement of those contractual claims and the trial court erred in dismissing the suit; and (2) the school, if dissatisfied with the result of its dispute resolution process, could seek board review of that resolution, however, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-30.5-108(3)(d) provided that, once the board had reached its decision, that decision was final and unappealable; the legislature made it clear that charter schools did not have standing to sue their school districts for disputes arising from implementation of the governing policy provisions in their charter contracts.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed it was error to deny him a hearing to present mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of his trial. The state supreme court agreed with the trial court's finding that the additional evidence tendered in support of reduction of the sentences were nearly identical to that presented at the sentencing hearing, which the jury had considered during the penalty phase and nonetheless rendered a verdict of death. Furthermore, the trial court adequately demonstrated that it considered the mitigating factors in defendant's motion, and explained its reasoning in support of its denial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals held that previous quasi-judicial PUC determinations did not preclude the inverse condemnation, trespass, and nuisance claims by the property owners as a result of the effects of the upgrade, rejecting the utility's argument that this would allow the owners to indirectly seek reversal of the PUC's approval of the upgrade itself. The court of appeals further concluded that the owners adequately alleged each of the torts claimed in their complaint. The supreme court affirmed in part, holding that PUC decisions were not adjudications of property rights, and thus did not preclude private rights of action regarding property rights. The court further held that while a plaintiff could not assert a claim for intentional nuisance unless a defendant's conduct was both intentional and unreasonable, here the owners successfully stated such a claim. The court reversed in part, holding that the owners could not assert a claim for inverse condemnation where the alleged taking concerned intangible impacts, namely noise and electromagnetic fields, and where the alleged damages were a depreciation in property value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that part of the court of appeals's decision that approved the claims seeking to adjudicate property rights, and affirmed the ruling sustaining the owners' nuisance claim. The court reversed in part, denying the claims for inverse condemnation and trespass, and remanded to allow litigation of the nuisance claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Supreme Court of Colorado granted certiorari to the Colorado Court of Appeals to review four decisions that reversed the trial court's denial of the defendants' Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motions and determined that parole following sexual offenses committed between July 1, 1996 and November 1, 1998 was discretionary under the provisions in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 17-2-201(5)(a.5), 18-1-105(1)(a)(V)(C) (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court addressed the question of the extension of its opinion in Martin, issued the same day, which held that under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-2-201(5)(a) (2000), a person convicted of a sexual offense committed before July 1, 1996 was subject to discretionary parole no longer than the remainder of the maximum sentence or five years, whichever was shorter. In the instant case, the four defendants committed their sexual offenses after July 1, 1996 but before November 1, 1998, thereby bringing into question the effect of &sect; 17-2-201(5)(a.5). The court concluded that the exact same language in &sect; 17-2-201(5)(a), (5)(a.5) had the identical meaning, and that as in Martin, they prevailed over the general sentencing provisions in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 17-22.5-403(7)(a), 18-1-105(1)(a)(V) (2000). Therefore, a person convicted of a sexual offense committed after July 1, 1996 but before November 1, 1998, was subject to a period of discretionary rather than mandatory parole, no longer than the remainder of the maximum sentence of incarceration imposed by the court.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals reversed. The state supreme court granted certiorari to determine the meaning of the requirement set forth in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-41-301(2)(a) (2000) whereby any request for workers' compensation arising from a claim of mental impairment had to be proven by evidence supported by the testimony of a licensed physician or psychologist. On review, the state supreme court affirmed. The court determined that &sect; 8-41-301(2)(a) encompassed any species of proof legally presented by the parties at trial through the medium of witnesses, records, documents, concrete objects, and the like. This claimant submitted reports, handwritten notations, and other documents authored by the licensed professionals. The agency wrongly denied her benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Secretary argued that the case was not moot because the Attorney General may bring an action pursuant to the FCPA as it existed at the time of the alleged violations, and because the case involved matters of great public importance since the constitutionality of the old contribution limits was still at issue in other litigation. The supreme court determined that the instant case was moot because: (1) the court declined to afford the Secretary an exception to the mootness doctrine on grounds that she may decide to prosecute these parties or others based upon the previous version of the FCPA; (2) the Secretary's concerns regarding other pending litigation in which the constitutionality of the prior statutes may be raised was collateral to the present case; and (3) the question of attorney fees in a related case could not alone resurrect the case from operation of the mootness doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Certiorari granted to consider the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-3-108(2)(a) of the Colorado Labor Peace Act, which made all residential picketing arising from labor disputes an unfair labor practice. The provision was facially unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Section 8-3-108 made an impermissible distinction between lawful and unlawful conduct based on the subject of the picket. The statute did not establish a minor place restriction on an extremely broad category of communications, it impermissibly curtailed speech on a narrowly drawn category of expression. The content-based restriction affecting property in a traditional public forum was not narrowly drawn to serve a compelling state interest. Any valid interest the state may have had in preserving residential privacy and tranquility was not furthered by selective prohibition of labor picketing. The trial court's order enjoining peaceful picketing outside the residence of a non-striking employee was invalid to the extent that it relied on &sect; 8-3-108. On remand the trial court must have clarified whether the union-related misconduct was enjoinable under the state police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed. The case was remanded to determine whether respondent authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct of its members and to clarify whether the union-related misconduct was enjoinable under the state police power, and if so, to what extent the injunction was based on that police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The knife petitioner was arrested for carrying was a T-handled push knife. The handle had finger grooves similar to metallic knuckles and was attached to a knife-blade that was less than three and one-half inches in length. Petitioner argued that the knife he carried did not fit the definition of &quot;knife&quot; for purposes of the concealed weapons statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-12-105 (2000). There was no evidence, other than the outward appearance of the knife, that petitioner intended to use it as a weapon. In overturning petitioner's conviction on the concealed weapons charge, the instant court concluded that to sustain a conviction under the concealed weapons statute in a case involving a knife with a blade less than three and one-half inches in length, the prosecution had to prove that petitioner used or intended to use the short-bladed knife as a weapon. Because neither the trial court nor the appellate court made a determination of petitioner's intent based on all the relevant circumstances, petitioner was entitled to a new trial on the concealed weapon charge.</SPAN></P>
