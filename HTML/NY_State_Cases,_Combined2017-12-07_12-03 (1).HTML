</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company was taxed as a merchant and appealed the decision of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York) which rejected plaintiff's claim that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 186 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company, owner and operator of a natural gas pipeline system which spanned numerous states, sought a tax refund for three specific years it had been taxed. Plaintiff challenged the tax as violative of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The trial court held that because N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 186 taxed gross earnings from New York sources only, plaintiff had not demonstrated that the tax was unconstitutional. Plaintiff contended that because, nationwide, it transported a higher volume of natural gas as a common carrier than it sold as a merchant, it should have been taxed as a transportation business under N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 183, 184 rather than as a merchant under &sect; 186. The court affirmed the decision because the record failed to demonstrate how the taxed income was grossly distorted or out of all proportion to the company's business in New York.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because plaintiff failed to demonstrate that taxation under the statute was not fairly apportioned, and therefore failed to show that tax violated the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Tax on Natural Gas Suppliers - Commerce Clause </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petitioner, an out-of-State corporation with a natural gas pipeline system extending over several States which was required to pay franchise taxes as a gas supplier pursuant to Tax Law &sect; 186 because it derived greater than 50% of its gross receipts from the sale of gas, has failed to demonstrate how taxation under Tax Law &sect; 186 violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl [3]).  In determining whether a State tax unduly burdens interstate commerce, it must be determined whether the tax is fairly apportioned so as to prevent each State from taxing any more than its fair share of an interstate transaction.  Petitioner challenges the tax insofar as it applied to gross earnings from sales of natural gas delivered in New York, without apportioning a segment of those gross earnings to activities outside the State that contributed to the company's New York sales.  Although the record establishes that Tax Law &sect; 186 taxed only gross earnings from New York sources, it does not demonstrate the extent to which gross earnings from New York sources came from sales, transportation, or other sources.  Even assuming, arguendo, that the &quot;overwhelming amount&quot; of gross earnings came from sales, the record still fails to demonstrate how the income attributed to New York is grossly distorted or out of all proportion to petitioner's business in New York.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged, in a consolidated appeal, New York trial court rulings finding that their nonmedical malpractice actions were time-barred by an amendment to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214(6) shortening the limitations period applicable to such actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought various nonmedical malpractice claims. The limitations period applicable to such claims was shortened by an amendment to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214(6), and the trial courts found that appellants' claims were time-barred. Appellants sought review. The statutory amendment was intended to apply both retrospectively and prospectively. Due process required that a party bringing such a claim had to be given a reasonable period to bring their action before it was time-barred. Since the legislature did not establish such a grace period, it was the proper function of the courts to do so. A case-by-case approach to this determination did not provide adequate notice to potential litigants or trial courts. Balancing the legislative intent of the amendment, the reasonable expectations of potential claimants, and the importance of the subject matter affected, an outside one-year grace period was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Some of the trial court rulings were affirmed and some were reversed by the appellate court's determination that nonmedical malpractice claims barred as of the effective date of the amendment to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214(6), shortening the limitations period, had the shorter of the remaining time under the former six-year limitations period or one year from the amendment's effective date to sue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Retroactive Application of Statute - Three-Year Statute of Limitations for Nonmedical Malpractice Actions - Remedial Nature of Statutory Amendment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. It was the intention of the Legislature that an amendment to CPLR 214 (6), which shortened the limitations period in nonmedical malpractice claims to three years regardless of whether the underlying theory is based in contract or tort, and which was to &quot;take effect immediately,&quot; was to apply to claims which had accrued before its effective date but were not commenced until after that date.  The history of the amendment indicates that its purpose was to rewrite a judicial interpretation of the nonmedical malpractice Statute of Limitations and to &quot;reaffirm&quot; the original legislative intent for a universally applied three-year limitations period in all malpractice cases other than those brought against professional health care providers.  The Legislature determined that a six-year period was unduly prolonged, and the amendment was seen as necessary to remediate the impact of judicial decisions which had held that nonmedical malpractice claims, when based on a contract theory, were governed by the six-year limitations period applicable to contract actions.  The remedial purpose of the amendment would be undermined if it were applied only prospectively.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Retroactive Application of Statute - Three-Year Statute of Limitations for Nonmedical Malpractice Actions - Procedural Due Process - Reasonable Time Requirement </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. It was the intention of the Legislature that an amendment to CPLR 214 (6), which shortened the limitations period in nonmedical malpractice claims to three years regardless of whether the underlying theory is based in contract or tort, was to apply to claims which had accrued before its effective date but were not commenced until after that date.  Although a potential litigant has no vested interest in or right to a specific limitations period, when such a period is statutorily shortened or created, due process requires that potential litigants be afforded a reasonable time to commence their actions before the bar takes effect.  Where an amendment does not contain a legislatively prescribed grace period, courts may uphold the constitutional validity of a retrospective application of a new statute by interpreting it as authorizing suits upon otherwise time-barred claims within a reasonable time after the statute's effective date. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Retroactive Application of Statute - Three-Year Statute of Limitations for Nonmedical Malpractice Actions - Procedural Due Process - Reasonable Time Requirement - General Rule </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. It was the intention of the Legislature that an amendment to CPLR 214 (6), which shortened the limitations period in nonmedical malpractice claims to three years regardless of whether the underlying theory is based in contract or tort, was to apply to claims which had accrued before its effective date but were not commenced until after that date.  Where an amendment does not contain a legislatively prescribed grace period, courts may uphold the constitutional validity of a retrospective application of a new statute by interpreting it as authorizing suits upon otherwise time-barred claims within a reasonable time after the statute's effective date. In determining what constitutes a reasonable time, a general rule should be applied to all cases in preference to a case-by-case analysis.  The shortcomings of a case-by-case approach are that it fails to provide adequate and clear notice and guidance to potential litigants, as well as to lower courts, of what might constitute a reasonable time and all but inevitably results in uneven application.  Accordingly, the Court shall make a balanced determination of what definite time period would fairly be necessary to afford a reasonable opportunity to interpose nonmedical malpractice claims, and then apply that period generally to all otherwise time-barred suits.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Retroactive Application of Statute - Three-Year Statute of Limitations for Nonmedical Malpractice Actions - Procedural Due Process - Reasonable Time Requirement - One Year or Time Remaining under Previous Statute&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. An amendment to CPLR 214 (6), which shortened the limitations period in all nonmedical malpractice claims to three years, applies to claims which had accrued before its effective date but were not commenced until after that date.  Given the absence of a legislatively prescribed grace period, the Court shall determine what constitutes a reasonable time after the statute's effective date within which affected litigants may commence an action.  The goal of the Legislature in amending subdivision (6) was immediately to curtail application of a six-year period of limitations in nonmedical malpractice cases resulting from two judicial decisions.  Giving accrued nonmedical malpractice claims the shorter of the time remaining under the former six-year period or three full years from the 1996 amendment's effective date fails to accomplish the intended result.  Moreover, fairness to litigants whose claims would otherwise be time-barred upon the effective date does not require extending the new limitations period to the shorter of either six years from accrual or three years from the amendment's effective date. However, giving nonmedical malpractice plaintiffs immediately barred as of the effective date of the amendment the shorter of either the remaining time under the former six-year limitations period or one year from the amendment's effective date in which to commence their actions, strikes the appropriate balance between State and litigants' personal interests for procedural due process purposes, comports with the legislative goal and the reasonable expectations of potential claimants, and gives due consideration to the importance of the &quot;subject matter&quot; of the claims affected.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes - Retroactive Application of Statute - Three-Year Statute of Limitations for Nonmedical Malpractice Actions - Procedural Due Process - Reasonable Time Requirement - Claims Not Immediately Barred </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. An amendment to CPLR 214 (6), which shortened the limitations period in all nonmedical malpractice claims to three years, applies to claims which had accrued before its effective date but were not commenced until after that date.  Due process requires that litigants affected by the amendment be given a reasonable time within which to commence their actions.  Cases not immediately barred by the amendment need to be examined to see if the time remaining provides a reasonable opportunity to interpose a claim.  Four months is unreasonably brief; such a drastic curtailment of a plaintiff's right to sue is not dictated in order to fulfill the legislative objective. Time barring a plaintiff for a four-month delay presents an element of unfairness given that other plaintiffs whose actions would have been immediately barred by the application of the amendment are to be given up to one year from the effective date to sue, thereby treating a diligent litigant more harshly than a less diligent one.  Accordingly, the same bright-line rule developed for litigants whose claims were immediately extinguished by the amendment shall apply to those whose claims temporarily survived the amendment; they shall have no less than one year after the amendment's effective date. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant requested review of a judgment by the Appellate Division (New York) which affirmed his conviction of burglary and related charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim reported he heard noise and called 911, saw defendant kick in victim's sliding glass door while holding a snow shovel, and that he struggled with defendant, prior to defendant running away. Appellant was apprehended after a chase near the victim's home. Appellant claimed he was strung out and shoveling victim's snow. Portions of video tape of remarks of a news reporter covering the burglary were presented to the grand jury. The grand jury returned an indictment. Defendant pled guilty to burglary and related charges and was convicted. The court affirmed his conviction on appeal. While defendant's constitutional right to be prosecuted on a jurisdictionally valid indictment survived the guilty plea, his right to challenge evidence in the fact-finding process engaged in by the grand jurors did not. Inadmissible evidence, inadvertently introduced into criminal proceedings, did not necessarily alter the validity of the proceedings; rather, such a defect rendered the indictment dismissible when the remaining evidence was insufficient to sustain the indictment. After a guilty plea, however, the sufficiency of the evidence before the grand jury could not be challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. While defendant's constitutional right to be prosecuted on a jurisdictionally valid indictment survived his guilty plea, his right to challenge evidence in the fact-finding process engaged in by the grand jurors did not. The challenged evidence was a video tape of remarks of a news reporter covering the burglary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant, by pleading guilty, forfeited the right to contend that the fact-finding process of the Grand Jury was impaired by the prosecutor's introduction of inadmissible videotaped hearsay, since defendant's claim does not activate a question of jurisdiction or a constitutional defect implicating the integrity of the process.  While defendant's constitutional right to be prosecuted on a jurisdictionally valid indictment survived the guilty plea, his right to challenge this evidence did not.  To allow such a right to survive would be fundamentally inconsistent with the plea of guilty, because the claim essentially relates to the quantum of proof required to satisfy the factual elements of the crimes considered by the Grand Jury.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state officials appealed a decision of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Fourth Department (New York), that granted plaintiff Monroe County Court judges' summary judgment motion and declared unconstitutional salary disparities between plaintiffs and Albany County judges. Plaintiffs cross-appealed denial of pre-judgment interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Monroe County judges challenged disparities in New York's judicial salary schedules that resulted in their being paid five percent less than judges in nearby Albany County. In response to their equal protection challenge, defendant state officials argued significant cost of living differences. The court, applying a rational basis level of scrutiny, held that if economic differentials in median home values and per capita income supported a salary disparity, it was constitutional. The intermediate appellate court had improperly looked to a totality of economic indicators test. Looking only to home values and per capita income, the court found large cost of living differentials between the two counties justified a five percent salary differential.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order, denied summary judgment to plaintiffs, and granted defendants' summary judgment motion.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judges - Judicial Salaries - Pay Disparity - Equal Protection - Rational Basis - Albany and Monroe Counties </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disparity between the salaries of County Court Judges in Albany and Monroe Counties survives equal protection constitutional scrutiny, since sufficient record evidence of reliable statistics indicating a rational economic basis for the disparate salaries exists to support the geographical pay differential. Economic differentials in median home values and per capita income can alone provide a rational basis for a salary disparity. Here, data indicating that the median home value was between 34% and 50% higher in Albany County than in Monroe County, and that Albany County Court handled 46% more filings and 45% more dispositions per Judge than Monroe County Court provide a rational basis for the less than 5% pay differential. Plaintiffs have therefore failed to satisfy their heavy burden of proving that there is no reasonably conceivable state of facts which rationally supports the distinction.  Moreover, a finding of unconstitutionality may not be based on an application of the &quot;totality of economic indicators&quot; test, since that test has been expressly rejected as contrary to the essential governing rational basis test. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandamus does not lie to compel a County Court to entertain petitioner's offer to plead guilty to all counts of the indictment charging him with capital murder, before the filing by the District Attorney of a notice of intent to seek the death penalty and prior to the expiration of the 120-day statutory period within which such notice may be filed (CPL 250.40 [2]), notwithstanding that CPL 220.10 (2) and 220.60 (2) generally permit defendants to plead guilty to an entire indictment upon arraignment and at any time before verdict.  Until the completion of the statutorily provided deliberative process, either by the filing of a death penalty notice, announcement of an intention not to seek that sanction, or by the expiration of the statutory period to make that decision, a capital defendant does not have an unqualified right to plead guilty to the entire indictment. If petitioner had an unqualified right to plead guilty to an entire capital crime indictment, two critical powers conferred on the District Attorney in the 1995 death penalty legislation could be preempted.  The defendant could thereby prevent the prosecution from pursuing the death penalty even after a notice of intent to seek the death penalty was filed under CPL 250.40 (1), and could preclude the District Attorney from even exercising the statutory right to consider, over time, whether to seek the ultimate sanction in a capital murder case.  Moreover, giving precedence to the subsequently enacted, specific provision of section 250.40 over the earlier enacted, more general provisions of CPL 220.10 (2) and 220.60 (2) is consistent with the canon of statutory interpretation that what is special or particular in the later of two statutes supersedes as an exception whatever in the earlier statute is unlimited or general.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged order of Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, which found that the primary purpose of appellant's purchase of second series certificates of an airline company was champertous and dismissed appellant's complaint of a breach of fiduciary duty against respondent bank.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court dismissed appellant's breach of fiduciary action against respondent bank on an appeal of respondent's motion to dismiss, finding that appellant had purchased second series certificates of an airline company in bankruptcy in order to bring a suit against respondent. The appellate court concluded that the record did not support a finding of champerty under N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 489 as a matter of law for summary resolution because it could not be determined on the record and in the procedural posture of the case that champerty was appellant's primary motivation or sole basis for acquiring the second series certificates. Thus, dismissal of the complaint was improper at this stage. The lower court's order was reversed and respondent's motion to dismiss on champerty grounds was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Champerty and Maintenance - Purchase of Investment Certificates - Intent to Sue - Primary Purpose - Summary Disposition </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In an action by the holder of a series of certificates of corporate indebtedness, alleging a breach of fiduciary duty against the trustee of that series of certificates, it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that plaintiff's purchases of the certificates were in violation of the prohibition against champerty contained in Judiciary Law &sect; 489.  Section 489 requires that the acquisition of a claim be made with the intent and for the purpose of bringing an action or proceeding.  It is impossible to determine whether the acquisition of the claims against defendant was an incidental part of, or the driving force behind, plaintiff's purchases of the certificates where plaintiff has offered various reasons for its purchases: to gain leverage to settle a related action; to profit on the certificates, which were purchased at a greatly reduced cost; and to at least be economically indifferent as to the result of the related action.  By purchasing the certificates, plaintiff could have simply been covering varying risks and potentialities, and its reasons qualify as a sufficient business motivation for the purchases.  Although plaintiff admitted that a lawsuit against defendant was a consideration at the time plaintiff began to purchase the certificates, the decision to sue cannot automatically become synonymous with champerty, for litigation can be an appropriate and commonly used strategy.  Moreover, the Appellate Division found evidence of a litigation-oriented &quot;primary purpose&quot; on the basis of a plainly mistaken fact and an inappropriate credibility determination. A finding of champerty as a matter of law might engender uncertainties in the free market system in connection with untold numbers of sophisticated business transactions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Champerty and Maintenance - Purchase of Investment Certificates - Intent to Sue - Primary Purpose </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In order to constitute champertous conduct in the acquisition of rights that would then be nullified in violation of Judiciary Law &sect; 489, the foundational intent to sue on that claim must at least have been the primary purpose for, if not the sole motivation behind, entering into the transaction.  The words, &quot;sole&quot; and &quot;primary,&quot; are not synonymous generally or in law.  A purpose that is the sole purpose is, by necessity, the primary purpose. However, a purpose that is primary is not necessarily the sole purpose. Yet, the distinction is one without a legal difference when the &quot;primary&quot; element is present.  Section 489 requires that the acquisition be made with the intent and for the purpose of bringing an action or proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, indicted for murder, claimed the Appellate Division (New York) erred by reversing a county court's finding that the definition of the term &quot;command&quot; contained in N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal required a determination of whether the statutory meaning of the word &quot;command&quot; contained in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27(1)(a)(vii) was impermissibly vague. The case evolved out of plaintiff People's theory that defendant, from his jail cell, commanded the murder of a material witness. The lower court found that the term &quot;command&quot; had a commonly understood meaning that met standard due process strictures. Defendant's claim that the term &quot;commanded,&quot; as transposed over into N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.27, was unconstitutionally vague was rejected. The term had a common-sense core of meaning that criminal juries would have been capable of understanding.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The word &quot;command,&quot; as used to define felony first degree murder in Penal Law &sect; 125.27 (1) (a) (vii), has a commonly accepted meaning, is not unconstitutionally vague, and survives the standard due process constitutional attack. The commonly accepted meaning of &quot;command&quot; for ordinary legal and constitutional purposes is &quot;to direct authoritatively,&quot; and it is significant that a &quot;command&quot; is the only type of accomplice liability activity for which a confederate may become liable for first degree murder. That selective precision manifests the Legislature's confidence and understanding that &quot;command&quot; is a distinctive term which is different from &quot;solicits,&quot; &quot;requests,&quot; or &quot;importunes.&quot; Moreover, &quot;commands&quot; has been retained throughout the development of the accomplice liability statute, while other terms have been recast.  </SPAN></P>

I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legitimate reach of N.Y. Penal Law &sect;235.22 outweighed its arguably impermissible applications. A person of ordinary intelligence could reasonably know that the statute was meant to prevent the intentional luring of minors to engage in sexual conduct through the dissemination of harmful, sexual images. It was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court held the statute survived first amendment strict scrutiny, because it curtailed the use of speech in a way which did not merit first amendment protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disseminating Indecent Material to Minors - Constitutionality - Overbreadth </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Penal Law &sect; 235.22, which criminalizes the use of sexually explicit communications, via a computer communications system, designed to lure children into harmful conduct, is not overbroad on the ground that it exposes individuals to criminal liability who unintentionally address a minor through sexually-oriented communication.  Under the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, statutes attempting to restrict or burden the exercise of First Amendment rights must be narrowly drawn, but a statute is subjected to less scrutiny where the behavior sought to be prohibited by the State moves from pure speech toward conduct and that conduct--even if expressive--falls within the scope of otherwise valid criminal laws that reflect legitimate State interests.  Where conduct and not merely speech is involved, the overbreadth doctrine can be invoked only where the overbreadth is substantial.  Section 235.22 is not directed at the mere transmission of certain types of communication over the Internet.  The terms &quot;importune,&quot; &quot;invite&quot; or &quot;induce&quot; used in the second part of the statute--the &quot;luring prong&quot;--describe acts of communication, not the content of one's views, and they identify forms of conduct which may provide a predicate for criminal liability. Moreover, the statute should be read as requiring that an individual intend to initiate this kind of communication with a minor and thereby further intend to &quot;importune, invite or induce&quot; the minor to engage in sexual conduct for the sender's benefit.  The term &quot;harmful to minors&quot; found in Penal Law &sect; 235.22 (1) is not overbroad on the ground that it allows New York to impose its community standards nationwide.  Thus, the legitimate reach of Penal Law &sect; 235.22 outweighs its arguably impermissible applications.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disseminating Indecent Material to Minors - Constitutionality - Overbreadth of Term &quot;Harmful to Minors&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. With respect to Penal Law &sect; 235.22, entitled &quot;Disseminating indecent material to minors in the first degree,&quot; which was enacted to address the convergence of predatory pedophile activity with Internet technology, the term &quot;harmful to minors,&quot; used to describe the type of communication deemed indecent, is not overbroad on the ground that it allows New York to impose its community standards nationwide.  Rather, that term was specifically defined according to the guidelines enunciated by the Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miller v California</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (413 US 15), and was further limited to &quot;actual or simulated nudity, sexual conduct or sado-masochistic abuse&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see also,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 235.20 [2], [3], [5]).  It is difficult to envision a situation where that conduct would not be considered harmful to minors outside New York when the statute seeks specifically to prohibit the intentional dissemination of this type of material to a minor in conjunction with the sender's enticement or invitation to the child to engage in sexual activity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disseminating Indecent Material to Minors - Constitutionality - Predatory Pedophile Activity on Internet - Vagueness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Penal Law &sect; 235.22, which is entitled &quot;Disseminating indecent material to minors in the first degree,&quot; and was enacted to address the convergence of predatory pedophile activity with Internet technology, is not unconstitutional on the ground of vagueness.  The phrases &quot;importunes, invites or induces,&quot; and &quot;sexual conduct for [the defendant's] benefit,&quot; used to describe how and why a defendant influences the conduct of his minor victim, provide adequate notice of what is prohibited and permit evenhanded application of the law both by law enforcement authorities and fact finders called to interpret the speech at issue.  Each and every term in the statute is either defined in the Penal Law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&sect; 235.20) or has a plain and ordinary meaning.  A person of ordinary intelligence would reasonably know that the statute is meant to prevent the intentional luring of minors to engage in sexual conduct through the dissemination of harmful, sexual images.  There is no possibility of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement: the combination of precise terms and the clearly pronounced elements adequately define the criminal conduct.  The statute employs objective, ascertainable standards which do not provide room for law enforcement officials to apply the statute based upon their own personal ideas of right and wrong.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disseminating Indecent Material to Minors - Constitutionality - Predatory Pedophile Activity on Internet - Content-Based Restriction - Strict Scrutiny </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Penal Law &sect; 235.22, which is entitled &quot;Disseminating indecent material to minors in the first degree,&quot; and was enacted to address the convergence of predatory pedophile activity with Internet technology, is not an unconstitutional content-based restriction.  Although the statute is content-based, since it affects sexually explicit communication, it survives First Amendment strict scrutiny because it curtails the use of speech in a way which does not merit First Amendment protection, and is a carefully tailored means of serving a compelling State interest of protecting children from sexual exploitation.  The speech conduct sought to be prohibited by the statute--the endangerment of children through the dissemination of sexually graphic material over the Internet--does not merit First Amendment protection, and, in any event, the statute does not effectuate a total ban on the dissemination of sexual content communication, but merely limits its use.  While the statute may incidentally burden some protected expression in carrying out its objective, it serves the compelling interest of preventing the sexual abuse of children and is no broader than necessary to achieve its purpose.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Disseminating Indecent Material to Minors - Constitutionality - Predatory Pedophile Activity on Internet - Commerce Clause - Burden on Interstate Trade </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Penal Law &sect; 235.22, which is entitled &quot;Disseminating indecent material to minors in the first degree,&quot; and was enacted to address the convergence of predatory pedophile activity with Internet technology, does not unduly burden interstate trade in violation of the Commerce Clause.  The statute, which prohibits individuals from luring children into sexual conduct, does not discriminate against or burden interstate trade; it regulates the conduct of individuals who intend to use the Internet to endanger the welfare of children.  There is no legitimate commerce that is derived from the intentional transmission of sexually graphic images to minors for the purpose of luring them into sexual activity. The conduct sought to be sanctioned by the statute is of the sort that deserves no &quot;economic&quot; protection.  Thus, section 235.22 is a valid exercise of the State's general police powers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Promoting Sexual Performance by Child - Constitutionality - Overbreadth </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. Penal Law &sect; 263.15, which prohibits the promotion of any performance which includes sexual conduct by a child under the age of 16, is not unconstitutional on the ground of overbreadth. The statutory scheme allows the fact finder to make a determination on the evidence submitted whether the performance involves an individual under 16, and defendant was permitted to introduce expert testimony challenging whether the images he transmitted to the undercover police officer posing as a 15-year-old girl actually depicted children or had been digitally spliced to &quot;manufacture&quot; the picture of a child performing a sexual act.  Of the many images transmitted by defendant, defendant's expert could point to only one that may have been digitally altered, and defendant did not object to the court's charge concerning the proof of age of the children in the pictures. The jury was thus instructed to consider, from the evidence before it, if a child who participated in the performance was under 16.  Accordingly, the statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad as applied to defendant.  </SPAN></P>

Chapter 5 of the Laws of 1999, which rescinded the personal income tax imposed by the City of New York on State resident commuters who work in the City while retaining the tax on out-of-State commuters who work in the City, and further provided that if a court declared the new law void, the entire tax authorization statute would be repealed, is not invalid on the ground that since it did not repeal the sections of the Administrative Code of the City of New York which implemented the tax, those provisions still have life, since chapter 5 repealed the authority on which the Code provisions are based; therefore, they are no longer effective.  Moreover, chapter 5 does not unlawfully delegate the Legislature's power by allowing a court to effectuate a repeal of the tax.  Legislative anticipation of judicial interpretation of a statute is nothing new.  Although the anticipation is ordinarily reflected in severability clauses that call for a legislative act to continue if one section is stricken, the direction that the entire statute falls if certain sections are invalidated was an appropriate legislative choice, and cannot be construed as delegating legislative power to the judiciary.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Chapter 5 of the Laws of 1999, which rescinded the personal income tax imposed by the City of New York on State resident commuters who work in the City while retaining the tax on out-of-State commuters who work in the City, and further provided that if a court declared the new law void, the entire tax authorization statute would be repealed, does not violate the home rule provisions of the State Constitution (art IX, &sect; 2 [b] [2]).  While chapter 5 is concededly a special law applying only to the City, it did not require a home rule message since it is supported by a substantial and legitimate State interest: to provide tax relief to State residents who live outside the City and to make the City more attractive for investment and growth, both goals with obvious implications for the State. The power to tax rests solely with the Legislature, and although the City alleges that the true motivation of chapter 5 was political, a court of law cannot inquire into the motives by which law was produced, since speculation on the &quot;political&quot; motivation of the Legislature as a judicial construct for statutory analysis would be a slippery and dangerous slope.  Rather, the court shall rely on the stated purpose and legislative history of an act to find or reject a substantial State concern.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxation - Personal Income Tax - Repeal of New York City Commuter Tax on State Residents Who Work in New York City - Home Rule Message Not Required for State Legislative Action - Enactment of Tax Pursuant to Home Rule Message Not Determinative of Need for Message on Repeal </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Chapter 5 of the Laws of 1999, which rescinded the personal income tax imposed by the City of New York on State resident commuters who work in the City while retaining the tax on out-of-State commuters who work in the City, and further provided that if a court declared the new law void, the entire tax authorization statute would be repealed, does not violate the home rule provisions of the State Constitution (art IX, &sect; 2 [b] [2]).  Although the Legislature requested a home rule message when the enabling law was initially enacted in 1966 (and on several occasions extending the tax since), a home rule message was not required prior to passage of chapter 5, since prior requests for home rule messages are not determinative of whether such messages are constitutionally required. Although the State appropriately authorized the City to implement the commuter tax, it never ceded its taxing authority to the City, nor pursuant to article XVI, &sect; 1 of the State Constitution could it.  Accordingly, a home rule message was not required.  The statute addresses a subject of substantial State concern, bears a reasonable relationship to that concern, and accomplishes the clearly expressed legislative objective of easing the burden on those State residents working in New York City, but living outside the City limits by repealing the commuter tax.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Chapter 5 of the Laws of 1999, which rescinded the personal income tax imposed by the City of New York on State resident commuters who work in the City while retaining the tax on out-of-State commuters who work in the City, violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution (art IV, &sect; 2) which requires a &quot;substantial equality of treatment&quot; for the citizens of a taxing State and nonresident taxpayers.  In assessing whether &quot;substantial equality&quot; exists between residents and nonresidents, the commuter tax may not be deemed an offset to an aggregation of general revenue taxes.  The &quot;substantial equality&quot; of the tax is measured by the impact of the tax in question on nonresident and residents, and does not employ a determination of each group's relative tax burdens, which would relegate constitutional analysis to a difficult, if not impossible, tax calculation that might vary between neighboring States and the lifestyles of individual commuters. The State, which asserts that balancing the tax burden between in-State and out-of-State resident commuters constitutes a &quot;substantial reason&quot; for chapter 5, has failed to satisfy the test of &quot;substantiality&quot;: the legislative history of chapter 5 reveals no &quot;tax equalization&quot; rationale for in-State and out-of-State commuters; rather, the State was concerned with providing a tax break to New York State resident commuters who work in the City, as well as attracting business to New York City.  </SPAN></P>

Chapter 5 of the Laws of 1999, which rescinded the personal income tax imposed by the City of New York on State resident commuters who work in the City while retaining the tax on out-of-State commuters who work in the City, violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution (art IV, &sect; 2) which requires a &quot;substantial equality of treatment&quot; for the citizens of a taxing State and nonresident taxpayers. There has been no showing that any differential tax burden exists such that repeal of the tax for New York residents but not for out-of-State residents yields &quot;substantial equality.&quot; Many of the &quot;offsetting&quot; taxes burdening State residents, such as on sales, unearned income, liquor and gasoline, are paid by all New York residents whether or not they work in New York City, and are also paid by out-of-State commuters who purchase goods and services while in New York.  Moreover, the State's position is contradictory: it alleges that City residents pay more to the State in revenue than they receive from the State in expenditures.  Thus, the City is not a net drain on the financial strength of the rest of the State, and resident commuters are not supporting the City through the numerous taxes.  Nor is it of any consequence that nonresident commuters may benefit from City services.  The tax on nonresident commuters is not a &quot;fee&quot; for those services; the tax is not predicated on a &quot;cost&quot; for the City services commuters use, nor is it correlated to State subsidies of those services.  </SPAN></P>

Chapter 5 of the Laws of 1999, which rescinded the personal income tax imposed by the City of New York on State resident commuters who work in the City while retaining the tax on out-of-State commuters who work in the City, violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution (art IV, &sect; 2) which requires a &quot;substantial equality of treatment&quot; for the citizens of a taxing State and nonresident taxpayers.  The State has made no showing that nonresidents are a &quot;peculiar source of evil&quot; at which chapter 5 is aimed.  There is no evidence that nonresident commuters pay less in taxes than their New York State counterparts, and there is no reasonable relationship between the &quot;danger&quot; of a disparate tax burden between New Yorkers and nonresident commuters as a class to justify the discrimination practiced against them.  Commuting into the City is not a taxable event substantially equivalent to the events on which the other taxes are based.  The language of the statute plainly and frankly discriminates against nonresidents, and the discrimination is so great that both its purpose and effect are exclusionary.  Chapter 5 operates as a general rule and intentionally creates inequality between resident and nonresident commuters in violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, which plainly and unmistakably protects the right of the citizens of one State to be exempt from any higher taxes or excises than those imposed by another State upon its own citizens.  </SPAN></P>

Chapter 5 of the Laws of 1999, which rescinded the personal income tax imposed by the City of New York on State resident commuters who work in the City while retaining the tax on out-of-State commuters who work in the City, violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution (art I, &sect; 8, cl [3]) since it discriminates against interstate commerce by imposing a tax on out-of-State commuters, but not on in-State commuters. A taxing scheme that taxes only nonresidents who work in New York City favors resident commuters. It treats in-State and out-of-State economic interests differently and taxes nonresidents simply because they cross State lines. Thus, the tax scheme benefits residents of New York State and burdens residents of other States who commute to New York City on a daily basis.  The law promotes economic protectionism and is incompatible with a single national economic unit.  It therefore is facially invalid, and may survive Commerce Clause scrutiny only if the State can show that the tax advances a local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives; however, tax relief for residents does not justify a discriminatory tax on nonresident workers.  The movement of persons across State lines is a form of commerce; the commuter tax impacts interstate commerce, and the Commerce Clause protects commuters. </SPAN></P>

The litigation represented the State's obligation to defend the constitutionality of a tax law that was passed by the State Legislature and signed by the Governor. Accordingly, an award of attorneys' fees is not appropriate.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendants appealed orders of Appellate Division (New York) affirming defendants' separate convictions in the supreme court and holding that the supreme court properly applied N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendants challenged the replacement of jurors under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 270.35[2][a]. In the first case, juror did not appear for the continuation of the trial and was replaced with an alternate. In the second case, two jurors, sworn and seated for trial, called in and stated that they could not be in court that day. The jurors were replaced with alternates. In the final case, during the court's final charge to the jury, a sick juror was unable to return for the afternoon session and was replaced with an alternate. All defendants were convicted, and the appellate division affirmed. The court of appeals affirmed all three cases holding that having determined the jurors would not be within two hours after the time set for the trial to resume, the trial courts complied with the statute and were well within their discretion in replacing the jurors with alternates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Jurors - Discharge of Juror - Replacement by Alternate of Juror Who Will be More than Two Hours Late </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Once a trial court has conducted a reasonably thorough inquiry into an absent juror's whereabouts and possible time of his or her return, CPL 270.35 (2) permits the court, in the exercise of its discretion, to replace the juror with an alternate, if it determines that the juror will not appear within two hours after the time the trial is scheduled to resume. The two-hour rule is a bright-line rule and does not apply only to unreachable, missing jurors since, by its terms, it applies not only &quot;if such juror fails to appear&quot;--the missing juror scenario--but also &quot;if the court determines that there is no reasonable likelihood such juror will be appearing&quot;--an ill or otherwise indisposed juror. The statute makes no distinction between a missing and a sick juror that would warrant applying the two-hour rule to one but not the other.  There is no reason to treat differently missing jurors who remain out of contact from those who explain their absence.  Both situations delay a trial, and the legislative history of the statute clearly evinces an intent to avoid delays and provide precise guidelines to trial courts deciding whether to discharge jurors who fail to appear.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Jurors - Discharge of Juror - Replacement by Alternate of Juror Who Will be More than Two Hours Late - Two-Hour Time Period Neither Arbitrary nor Unconstitutional&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Once a trial court has conducted a reasonably thorough inquiry into an absent juror's whereabouts and possible time of his or her return, if it is determined that the juror will not appear within two hours after the time the trial is scheduled to resume, CPL 270.35 (2) permits the court, in the exercise of its discretion, to replace the juror with an alternate, and the two-hour time period is not an arbitrary time limit that interferes with a defendant's right to trial by jury guaranteed by article I, &sect; 2 of the State Constitution.  The dictates of CPL 270.35 (2) provide good cause for discharging and replacing a juror. The &quot;reasonably thorough inquiry&quot; required by the statute insures against arbitrary decision-making regarding the substitution of alternates. Moreover, the two-hour rule is not an arbitrary cut-off point, but strikes a constitutionally acceptable balance between the need to avoid uncertainty and delay, and the defendant's right to an orderly jury trial. Accordingly, where a juror became ill before the Trial Judge's eyes and was sent home, and the court contacted the juror at home after the lunch recess and determined that she was still not feeling well and was too ill to return for the afternoon session, replacing that juror was clearly proper and did not offend constitutional principles.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Jurors - Discharge of Juror - Replacement by Alternate of Juror Who Will be More than Two Hours Late - Conclusive Presumption </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Once a trial court has conducted a reasonably thorough inquiry into an absent juror's whereabouts and possible time of his or her return, CPL 270.35 (2) permits the court, in the exercise of its discretion, to replace the juror with an alternate, if it determines that the juror will not appear within two hours after the time the trial is scheduled to resume. Although the statute states that &quot;the court may presume such juror is unavailable,&quot; the incorporation of a rebuttable presumption into the statute is at direct odds with the legislative purpose of providing clear guidelines for trial courts to follow as to how long a Trial Judge must wait for an absent juror. Given the clear indication of purpose, it is illogical to view the two-hour period as creating only a presumption that could be dispelled by showing that an absent juror could be available some time after the two-hour period. Rather, the juror who is or who the court reasonably believes will be more than two hours late can be conclusively presumed to be unavailable and is subject, in the court's discretion, to discharge.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Jurors - Discharge of Juror - Replacement by Alternate of Juror Who Will be More than Two Hours Late - Court's Duty to Make Reasonably Thorough Inquiry </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Once a trial court has conducted a reasonably thorough inquiry into an absent juror's whereabouts and possible time of his or her return, CPL 270.35 (2) permits the court, in the exercise of its discretion, to replace the juror with an alternate, if it determines that the juror will not appear within two hours after the time the trial is scheduled to resume. A rule permitting discharge after two hours does not render that part of the statute requiring the court to conduct a &quot;reasonably thorough inquiry&quot; unnecessary, since holding that a trial juror who is absent for more than two hours could be discharged and replaced does not jettison a trial court's statutory duty to conduct a reasonably thorough inquiry into a juror's availability.  To the contrary, this inquiry, which the statute mandates, is a prerequisite to obtaining the presumption that a juror is unavailable. Without a reasonably thorough inquiry, the exercise of the court's discretion on the ultimate issue of whether or not to replace the juror would be uninformed.  A trial court has significant discretion to reach a balanced determination on replacing a juror based on the entirety of the circumstances, which can include the ability of an absent juror to return, the stage of the trial, the need to avoid delay, the possibility of prejudice, and the effect on the many other participants involved.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were public assistance recipients required by defendant New York City Department of Social Services, under welfare reform legislation, to participate in a Work Experience Program. They were assigned to various not-for-profit organizations and New York City agencies. Defendant calculated the required hours of participation by dividing the amount of benefits received by the Federal minimum wage. Plaintiffs sought judicial relief to require defendant to re-figure the calculations based on the pertinent prevailing wage rate pursuant to N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court held that: (1) plaintiffs were not &quot;in the employ of&quot; anyone because they did not receive wages; (2) the city agencies and not-for-profit organizations to which plaintiffs were assigned were not &quot;contractors or sub-contractors&quot; within the meaning of the constitutional provision; and (3) plaintiffs were not engaged in &quot;public work&quot; within the envisioned scope of that constitutional term of art.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prevailing wage provision of NY Constitution, article I, &sect; 17 does not apply to public assistance beneficiaries who are statutorily required to participate in the Work Experience Program as a condition of continued receipt of monetary grants.  Therefore, using the typically lower minimum wage rate to compute the number of hours a beneficiary must work in order to satisfy his requirement does not facially violate the Constitution, since such beneficiaries are not &quot;in the employ of&quot; anyone within the intendment of the Constitution.  Further, municipal agencies and not-for-profit organizations to which beneficiaries are assigned as a part of the Program are not &quot;contractors or subcontractors&quot; within the meaning of the constitutional provision, and such beneficiaries are not engaged in &quot;public work&quot; within the envisioned scope of that constitutional term of art.  The expectations of &quot;public work&quot; reflected in the record of the debate on the constitutional provision in question are specifically and intentionally related to construction projects, rather than general services. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Local Law No. 44 (2012) of City of New York, which relates to the disclosure on a public website of information regarding &quot;affordable housing&quot; projects that defendant Department of Housing Preservation and Development initiates, funds, or otherwise participates in, was not preempted by articles of the Private Housing Finance Law and General Municipal Law that delegate powers to defendant to make loans or grants to develop both private and public properties for affordable housing under the doctrine of field preemption. The statements of legislative findings and purposes contained in the Private Housing Finance Law and General Municipal Law contained no statement of general preemption, nor could any intent to preempt the entire field of affordable housing be implied from the policy and purposes underpinning the relevant articles. The purpose of those articles is to improve the quantity, quality and affordability of housing in the City of New York, allow the City to assist the private sector in the development of affordable housing by authorizing it to expend funds to do so, and allow the City to build affordable housing and dispose of property. The legislative materials merely reflected the legislature's efforts to create a framework for the financing of affordable housing projects and to defer operational functions to local municipalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws--Preemption by State--Conflict Preemption--Regulation of Affordable Housing Projects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Local Law No. 44 (2012) of City of New York, which relates to the disclosure on a public website of information regarding &quot;affordable housing&quot; projects that defendant Department of Housing Preservation and Development initiates, funds, or otherwise participates in, was not preempted by articles of the Private Housing Finance Law and General Municipal Law that delegate powers to defendant to make loans or grants to develop both private and public properties for affordable housing under the doctrine of conflict preemption. Local Law No. 44 does not directly conflict with the state statutory scheme for affordable housing or wage reporting and does not improperly contravene the state legislature's specific statutory delegations of responsibility to defendant or restrict the manner in which the agency exercises its delegated authority. Nor does the law prohibit what would be permissible for defendant under the General Municipal Law or the Private Housing Finance Law or impose prerequisite additional restrictions on defendant's rights to provide loans or grants under those laws. Compliance with the local law is not a condition for access to housing finance funding and, thus, the law did not interfere in any way with defendant's financing, loan, and land disposition processes. While the City Charter provides that, where the City is providing grants or loans related to affordable housing, the programs must be run by defendant, defendant was subject to the oversight of the City Council and certain powers were delegated to the Mayor and City Council as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiffs, a trade association for the affordable housing industry and contractors or subcontractors that have worked on affordable housing projects, failed to establish that Local Law No. 44 (2012) of City of New York, which relates to the disclosure on a public website of information regarding &quot;affordable housing&quot; projects that defendant Department of Housing Preservation and Development initiates, funds, or otherwise participates in, was unconstitutional because it violated the Due Process Clause of the New York State Constitution under the &quot;stigma plus&quot; rule. Plaintiffs did not show that they had been stigmatized, since defendant had not published any consumer complaints and had not yet issued regulations under the local law setting forth a protocol for vetting consumer complaints before their publication on its website. Nor did plaintiffs show that they had been deprived of any future employment opportunities, and it was speculation to say that they might ever be thus deprived. Further, the local law does not provide that, in the event consumer complaints about contractors are received, the contractors would not be considered for affordable housing projects.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs, a trade association for the affordable housing industry and contractors or subcontractors that have worked on affordable housing projects, failed to establish that Local Law No. 44 (2012) of City of New York, which relates to the disclosure on a public website of information regarding &quot;affordable housing&quot; projects that defendant Department of Housing Preservation and Development initiates, funds, or otherwise participates in, was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the New York State Constitution on the basis that it discriminated against corporations in favor of individuals. The rational basis for making a distinction between corporations and individuals was to protect small businesses from the costs of reporting. The local law was not invalid under rational-basis review simply because it may be underinclusive or fail to address all aspects of the problem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff taxpayers had common-law standing to challenge the constitutionality of New York's &quot;tax cap&quot; legislation (Education Law &sect; 2023-a) which imposes a tax levy cap on school districts unless the levy is approved by a supermajority of 60% of school budget voters. Plaintiffs established that they voted for budgets requiring levies that exceeded the cap which failed to achieve the required supermajority approval, and alleged that the tax cap impaired their constitutional rights, including the right to participate in the governance of their own schools, and degraded their ability to provide school funding as they saw fit. These allegations met the common-law standard for standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">-- Standing -- Citizen Taxpayer Standing -- Challenge to Property Tax Freeze Credit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff taxpayers had standing under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b (1) to challenge the constitutionality of New York's property &quot;tax freeze&quot; credit (Education Law &sect; 2023-b; Tax Law &sect; 606 [bbb]), which provided a two-year income tax credit to eligible homeowners who had paid real property taxes to schools that abided by New York's property &quot;tax cap&quot; (Education Law &sect; 2023-a), where they alleged that the legislation authorized a wrongful expenditure, misappropriation, misapplication, or illegal or unconstitutional disbursement of state funds due to its allocation of those funds for a tax credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- State Aid to School Districts -- Constitutional Challenge to Property Tax Cap and Property Tax Freeze Credit -- Education Article Claim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff taxpayers' complaint challenging the constitutionality of New York's &quot;tax cap&quot; legislation (Education Law &sect; 2023-a), which imposes a tax levy cap on school districts unless the levy is approved by a supermajority of 60% of school budget voters, and property &quot;tax freeze&quot; credit (Education Law &sect; 2023-b; Tax Law &sect; 606 [bbb]), which provided a two-year income tax credit to eligible homeowners who had paid real property taxes to schools that abided by New York's property tax cap, failed to state a cause of action under the Education Article of the New York Constitution (NY Const, art XI, &sect; 1). The Education Article enshrines in the Constitution a state-local partnership in which people with a community of interest and a tradition of acting together to govern themselves make the basic decisions on funding and operating their own schools. The provision is intended to ensure that education is a responsibility of the State, and fundamentally protects against failures by the State to provide adequate instruction and facilities commensurate with that responsibility. Here, plaintiffs' claims were not viable because they failed to allege that the challenged legislation so impaired local financing ability that it implicated the State's duty to provide funding sufficient to bring the educational inputs locally available up to a minimum standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- State Aid to School Districts -- Constitutional Challenge to Property Tax Cap and Property Tax Freeze Credit -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff taxpayers' claims that New York's &quot;tax cap&quot; legislation (Education Law &sect; 2023-a), which imposes a tax levy cap on school districts unless the levy is approved by a supermajority of 60% of school budget voters, and property &quot;tax freeze&quot; credit (Education Law &sect; 2023-b; Tax Law &sect; 606 [bbb]), which provided a two-year income tax credit to eligible homeowners who had paid real property taxes to schools that abided by New York's property tax cap, failed to state a cause of action for deprivation of equal protection under the law. Education is not a fundamental right under either the Federal or New York Constitutions and, absent any allegation that the challenged legislation discriminates against a suspect class, the rational basis test is the appropriate standard. The rational basis test is not demanding, and a statute will pass muster under it unless a challenger meets the tremendous burden of demonstrating that no facts can reasonably be conceived to show the existence of a rational basis in support of some legitimate state interest in drawing the distinction. Here, the tax cap and the tax freeze were designed with the legitimate goal in mind of restraining onerous property tax increases that were believed to be depressing economic activity in the state. While these enactments incentivized districts and their residents to avoid property tax increases over the tax cap, neither prevented such increases if sufficient community support existed for them. The differences in the services offered by various school districts accordingly resulted from a permissible consequence of local control over schools, namely, the variable willingness of the taxpayers of different districts to pay for and to provide enriched educational services and facilities beyond what the basic per pupil expenditure figures would permit. Inasmuch as there was nothing irrational in this, plaintiffs' equal protection claims failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- State Aid to School Districts -- Constitutional Challenge to Property Tax Cap and Property Tax Freeze Credit -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiff taxpayers' claims that New York's &quot;tax cap&quot; legislation (Education Law &sect; 2023-a), which imposes a tax levy cap on school districts unless the levy is approved by a supermajority of 60% of school budget voters, and property &quot;tax freeze&quot; credit (Education Law &sect; 2023-b; Tax Law &sect; 606 [bbb]), which provided a two-year income tax credit to eligible homeowners who had paid real property taxes to schools that abided by New York's property tax cap, failed to state a cause of action for a deprivation of due process. A law that impinges upon a fundamental right is subject to strict scrutiny, whereas one that does not burden a fundamental right is valid if it bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. The tax cap did not impair the fundamental right to vote because a supermajority requirement passes constitutional muster unless it discriminates against or authorizes discrimination against any identifiable class, and here, nothing of the sort was alleged. While the denial of a tax freeze credit to an individual who engages in certain forms of speech may penalize them for such speech, here, taxpayers remained free to vote as they wished in school budget elections, and their individual votes (or nonvotes) had no direct role in deciding their access to the tax freeze credit. Taxpayers in school districts where budgets with tax levies exceeding the property tax cap were proposed and adopted were not denied a tax credit because they engaged in constitutionally protected activities, but were simply required to pay for school property taxes entirely out of their own pockets rather than receiving a subsidy to offset those costs. Given that no fundamental rights were implicated, and that both the tax cap and the tax freeze were rationally related to the legitimate government interest of restraining crippling property tax increases, plaintiffs' substantive due process claims were properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial court properly granted the New York State Attorney General's pre-answer motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint because Penal Law &sect;&sect; 120.30 and 125.15 provided a valid statutory basis to prosecute licensed physicians who provided aid-in-dying to their patients, the word &quot;suicide&quot; had a straightforward meaning, and whatever label one put on the act that the plaintiffs were asking to be permitted, it unquestionably fit that literal description, since there was a direct causative link between the medication proposed to be administered by physicians and their patients' demise; [2]-The plaintiffs failed to show that a ban on aid-in-dying violated their state constitutional equal protection and due process rights because, even giving plaintiffs the benefit of every reasonable inference, aid-in-dying was not an issue where a legitimate consensus had formed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 120.30, which provides that &quot;[a] person is guilty of promoting a suicide attempt when he [or she] intentionally causes or aids another person to attempt suicide,&quot; and 125.15 (3), which provides that &quot;[a] person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when [he or she] intentionally causes or aids another person to commit suicide,&quot; prohibit physician-assisted suicide (aid-in-dying) and provide a valid statutory basis to prosecute licensed physicians who provide aid-in-dying. The word &quot;suicide,&quot; which has a straightforward meaning, is traditionally defined as the act or instance of taking one's own life voluntarily and intentionally, especially by a person of years of discretion and of sound mind. Aid-in-dying unquestionably fits this literal description since there is a direct causative link between the medication proposed to be administered by plaintiff physicians and their patients' demise. While plaintiffs argued that aid-in-dying reflected a starkly different choice than suicide--that of death by a quick and painless means over death that is equally certain to happen in reasonably close temporal proximity but in a manner that is sure to be unbearably painful--no rule of statutory construction allowed the plain language to be ignored simply because there was a possibility that the legislature, writing on a blank slate, would have chosen to carve out of that definition a particular application of the term. Further, legislative history revealed that section 125.15 (3) was intended to apply even where the defendant was motivated by sympathetic concerns, such as the desire to relieve a terminally ill person from the agony of a painful disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law--State Constitutional Law--Equal Protection--Aid-in-Dying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. New York's prohibition on physician-assisted suicide (aid-in-dying) (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect;&sect; 120.30, 125.15 [3]) does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the New York Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 11). New York's Equal Protection Clause is no broader in coverage than the federal provision, and New York's distinction between the right to refuse medical treatment and the prohibition on aid-in-dying is permissible under the United States Constitution. New York's prohibition on aid-in-dying does not violate equal protection as the refusal of treatment and the affirmative administration of life-ending medication are fundamentally different things. New York does not treat anyone differently from anyone else or draw any distinctions between persons. Everyone, regardless of physical condition, is entitled, if competent, to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment; no one is permitted to assist a suicide. Plaintiffs failed to establish that the Court should reconsider whether aid-in-dying was functionally indistinct from the refusal to be kept alive as they failed to sufficiently demonstrate a societal evolution on the question of aid-in-dying such that, if the ban was upheld, the Court would be paying blind adherence to outmoded thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law--State Constitutional Law--Due Process--Aid-in-Dying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. New York's prohibition on physician-assisted suicide (aid-in-dying) (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect;&sect; 120.30, 125.15 [3]) does not violate the Due Process Clause of the New York Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 6). A ban on aid-in-dying does not implicate a fundamental liberty interest under the United States Constitution, and is rationally related to a state's interests in preserving human life, protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession, and ensuring the welfare of vulnerable groups. New York has, at times, found that the State Due Process Clause may be more protective of rights than its federal counterpart, and has treated a person's freedom of choice with respect to his or her own body and medical treatment as a vitally important right to be subordinated to the State's prerogatives under only compelling circumstances. However, such circumstances all involved a patient's right to refuse medical treatment, and were rooted in the same concepts that gave rise to a cause of action for medical malpractice based on the lack of informed consent--that every person of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what should be done with his or her own body, and a surgeon who performs an operation without the patient's consent commits an assault for which the surgeon is liable in damages. Here, plaintiffs failed to establish that the same principles applied to the affirmative act of taking one's own life. Plaintiffs offered nothing other than conclusory arguments for why, unlike the United States Constitution, the New York State Constitution should be construed to extend the right to refuse treatment and let nature take its course to a fundamental right to receive treatment that does the opposite. Plaintiffs also failed to establish that the Court should reconsider whether the ban on aid-in-dying was rationally related to a legitimate government interest as they failed to sufficiently demonstrate a societal evolution on the question of aid-in-dying such that, if the ban was upheld, the Court would be paying blind adherence to outmoded thinking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-In a CPLR art. 78 proceeding, the trial court properly annulled a determination of the Board of Parole denying an inmate's request for parole release because the inmate was 16 years old when he was convicted of murder in the second degree and sentenced, in 1979, to a prison term of 22 years to life, but the Board failed to consider the significance of the inmate's youth and its attendant circumstances at the time of the commission of the crime before making a parole determination; the inmate was entitled to a de novo parole release hearing; [2]-The trial court erred in precluding one of the Board's commissioners from participating in any future parole proceeding because the inmate did not request such relief, and the record provided no basis for a conclusion that the commissioner at issue was either unqualified or biased.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, a juvenile homicide offender who was sentenced to a term of 22 years to life and had been denied parole release nine times since becoming eligible, was entitled to a de novo parole release hearing where the parole board failed to consider the significance of petitioner's youth and its attendant circumstances at the time of the commission of the crime before making its parole determination and thus denied him a meaningful opportunity for release. As a person serving a sentence for a crime committed as a juvenile, petitioner had a substantive constitutional right not to be punished with a life sentence if the crime reflected transient immaturity. The procedural requirement necessary to implement this substantive guarantee at the sentencing stage is a hearing where youth and its attendant characteristics are considered in order to separate out those who can be punished by a life in prison from those who cannot. Moreover, a constitutional life sentence for a juvenile homicide offender--for all but the rare case of an irreparably corrupt juvenile--guarantees, at some point, a meaningful opportunity to obtain release. A parole board is no more entitled to subject an offender to the penalty of life in prison in contravention of this rule than is a legislature or a sentencing court, and an analogous procedural requirement is necessary at the parole release hearing stage. Thus, for those persons--like petitioner--convicted of crimes committed as juveniles who, but for a favorable parole determination will be punished by life in prison, the parole board must provide a meaningful opportunity for release by considering youth and its attendant characteristics in relationship to the commission of the crime at issue before making its parole determination. Here, neither the hearing transcript nor the parole board's written determination reflected that the parole board met its constitutional obligation to consider these factors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A 2013 amendment to Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 25-a (1-a), which closed the reopened case fund to newly reopened claims as of January 1, 2014 and provided that any reopened claims that would have been transferred to the fund under the former law would become the obligation of the carrier, impermissibly imposed on plaintiff private insurance companies that underwrite workers' compensation insurance policies significant additional liability retroactively with respect to contracts issued before October 1, 2013. The reopened case fund provided for the payment of workers' compensation benefits to employees whose cases were closed and later reopened and was financed by an annual assessment from workers' compensation insurers. Its existence meant that reopened claims were not included when insurers' premium rates for their occurrence-based policies were calculated and approved. Premiums charged for policies approved prior to October 1, 2013 took into account the transfer to the fund of reopened claims under former Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 25-a, and did not account for potential future liability relating to such claims, which were expected to qualify for a transfer to the fund. While policies approved on or after October 1, 2013 included premium increases to cover the additional liability resulting from the closure of the fund, a benefit payable on a reopened claim made after January 1, 2014 but arising out of an accident that occurred before October 1, 2013 would impose on the insurer a liability that was not contemplated when the premium for the pre-October 1, 2013 policy was calculated. The fund's closure failed to provide for this unfunded liability. Even though the statute mandated only the payment of future benefits, it nonetheless impermissibly attached new legal consequences to a relationship completed before its enactment.</SPAN></P>

The amendment impermissibly imposed on plaintiff private insurance companies that underwrite workers' compensation insurance policies significant additional liability retroactively with respect to contracts issued before October 1, 2013. The amendment violated the Contract Clause because it retroactively impaired an existing contractual obligation to provide insurance coverage where the insurer did not have the right to terminate the policy or change the premium rate. Defendants failed to show that the impairment was reasonable and necessary to serve a significant and legitimate public purpose. The legislation's stated purpose of preventing a windfall to insurance carriers was based upon the erroneous premise that premiums already covered this new liability. Retroactive application also constituted a regulatory taking as it imposed severe retroactive liability on a limited class of parties that could not have anticipated the liability, and the extent of that liability was substantially disproportionate to the parties' experience.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Rights--Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation--Refusal to Host Same-Sex Wedding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a proceeding pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 298, the determination of respondent State Division of Human Rights (SDHR) finding that petitioners, the owners and operators of facilities rented to the public as a venue for wedding ceremonies and receptions, were subject to the Human Rights Law and engaged in unlawful discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation when they refused to host a same-sex wedding for respondents, a same-sex couple, was confirmed. SDHR properly found that petitioners' wedding facilities fell within the broad definition of &quot;place of public accommodation&quot; under Executive Law &sect; 292 (9). That the wedding ceremonies occurred on private property and pursuant to written contracts did not remove petitioners' facilities from the reach of the Human Rights Law, the critical factor being that the facilities were made available to the public at large. Further, the finding that petitioners engaged in unlawful discrimination was supported by substantial evidence. Petitioners displayed no unwillingness to allow respondents to marry at their facility until it was revealed that respondents were a same-sex couple. Petitioners could not distinguish their conduct from that prohibited under Executive Law &sect; 296 (2) (a) by claiming that their decision not to host same-sex marriages was based solely upon their religious beliefs, as the act of entering into a same-sex marriage is conduct that is inextricably tied to sexual orientation. There is no basis for distinguishing between discrimination based on sexual orientation and discrimination based on someone's conduct of publicly committing to a person of the same sex. Further, petitioners' purported willingness to offer some services to respondents did not cure their refusal to provide a wedding ceremony. The Human Rights Law does not permit businesses to offer a limited menu of goods or services to customers on the basis of a status that fits within one of the protected categories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law--Freedom of Religion--Mandated Hosting of Same-Sex Wedding--Free Exercise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 298, the remedy imposed by respondent State Division of Human Rights requiring petitioners, the owners and operators of wedding facilities who were found to have illegally discriminated against respondents, a same-sex couple, by refusing to host their wedding, to cease and desist from engaging in discriminatory practices and establish anti-discrimination training and procedures did not violate petitioners' rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal or State Constitutions. The Human Rights Law (Executive Law art 15) does not target religious beliefs, nor is its objective to infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation. Rather, the Human Rights Law generally forbids all discrimination against a protected class in places of public accommodation regardless of the motivation. The fact that some religious organizations and educational facilities are exempt from the statute's public accommodation provision did not demonstrate that it was not neutral or generally applicable so as to violate petitioners' First Amendment free exercise rights. Moreover, balancing the competing interests involved, petitioners failed to show that respondent's determination constituted an unreasonable interference with their religious freedom under New York's Free Exercise Clause. While the burden placed on petitioners' right to freely exercise their religion was not inconsequential, it did not require them to participate in the marriage of a same-sex couple and left them free to adhere to and profess their religious beliefs that same-sex couples should not marry. To be weighed against petitioners' interests in adhering to the tenets of their faith was New York's long-recognized, substantial interest in eradicating discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law--Freedom of Speech--Mandated Hosting of Same-Sex Wedding at Venue Open to Public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 298, respondent State Division of Human Rights' directive that petitioners, the owners and operators of facilities open to the public as a venue for weddings, cease and desist from their practice of prohibiting same-sex marriage ceremonies did not violate the free speech rights guaranteed to them by the Federal and State Constitutions. The conduct allegedly compelled was not sufficiently expressive as to trigger First Amendment protections in that there was no real likelihood that petitioners would be perceived as endorsing the values or lifestyle of the individuals renting their facilities as opposed to merely complying with anti-discrimination laws. Respondent's determination did not compel petitioners to endorse, espouse or promote same-sex marriages, and instead simply required them to abide by the law and offer the same goods and services to same-sex couples that they offered to other couples. Further, there was nothing in the record to indicate that petitioners' wedding business was organized for specific expressive purposes, rather than for the purpose of making a profit through service contracts with customers, so as to invoke the First Amendment's protection for expressive association. Even if petitioners were deemed to be an expressive enterprise, a customer's association with a business for the limited purpose of obtaining goods and services, as opposed to becoming part of the business itself, does not trigger the First Amendment's protection for expressive association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Rights--Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation--Compensatory Damages Award and Civil Penalty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 298, there was no basis upon which to disturb either the compensatory damages award or the civil fine assessed by respondent State Division of Human Rights against petitioners, the owners and operators of wedding facilities who were found to have illegally discriminated against respondents, a same-sex couple, by refusing to host their wedding. Respondents were the victims of discrimination based on their sexual orientation, and the record reflected the hurt, humiliation and mental anguish that they suffered as a result of petitioners' conduct. The compensatory damages awards to each of them were well in accord with those sustained in similar cases. Mindful that respondent State Division of Human Rights has been empowered to take appropriate action to fulfill the extremely strong statutory policy of eliminating discrimination, the $10,000 civil fine imposed upon petitioners did not constitute an abuse of discretion as a matter of law (Executive Law &sect; 297 [4] [c] [vi]).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The court affirmed the judgment of trial court declaring New York's Sexual Assault Reform Act, Executive Law &sect; 259-c(14), was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied to a parolee because SARA imposed no restrictions, punishment, or penalty over and above that to which parolees were already subject to, was not enacted with a punitive intent, and did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, US Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The mandatory 1,000-foot buffer zone contained in New York's Sexual Assault Reform Act (Executive Law &sect; 259-c [14]) (SARA), which prohibited petitioner, a sex offender parolee who had been convicted before SARA was passed and amended, from residing or traveling near schools or other institutions where minor children congregate, did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution (art I, &sect; 10). Both SARA, as originally enacted, and the 2005 amendments, were intended to be civil measures designed to protect children from victimization by sexual predators by limiting access that certain previously adjudicated sex offenders could have to defined public areas where children regularly congregate and travel. The child-focused language in the statute itself strongly supports the legislative intent to protect children as opposed to further punishing sex offenders. Although the residency and travel restrictions SARA imposes constitute affirmative restraints, bear some resemblance to historical criminal punishment and serve the goal of deterrence, SARA only applies to parolees, who otherwise have restricted liberty. Because the actual restraints SARA places on parolees are no greater than the restrictions or conditions to which they are otherwise subject, they do not transform SARA's civil regulatory scheme into criminal punishment. Moreover, there is a sufficient rational connection between SARA's nonpunitive intent of deterring recidivism and its effect of limiting access to potential victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">--Sex Offenders--Sexual Assault Reform Act--Residence and Travel Restrictions--Substantive Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. New York's Sexual Assault Reform Act (Executive Law &sect; 259-c [14]) (SARA), which prohibited petitioner sex offender parolee from residing or traveling near schools or other institutions where minor children congregate, did not deprive petitioner of his liberty or the right to intrastate travel in violation of the Due Process Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions (US Const Amends V, XIV; NY Const, art I, &sect; 6). Even assuming there is a fundamental right to intrastate travel, SARA does not violate any such right. Parolees subject to SARA have only conditional liberty. They have no liberty interest, let alone a fundamental right, to be free from special conditions of parole. Even if SARA were to implicate a deprivation of petitioner's liberty right, that right would not be a fundamental one. Therefore, the inquiry is whether SARA bears a rational relationship to the legitimate government interest it seeks to advance. On a rational basis review, a statute will be upheld unless the disparate treatment is so unrelated to the achievement of any combination of legitimate purposes that it is irrational. Under such a highly deferential standard, SARA did not violate any of petitioner's substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In an action challenging the constitutionality of the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act (SAFE Act), heightened review of the facts justifying the message of necessity was not required, even though the SAFE Act impacted upon fundamental rights. NY Constitution, article III, &sect; 14 requires that a bill be printed and placed upon the desks of legislators &quot;at least three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage,&quot; unless the governor &quot;certifies the facts which in his or her opinion necessitate an immediate vote thereon,&quot; but the sufficiency of those facts is not subject to judicial review. Inasmuch as the message of necessity provided a factual justification, no further judicial review was warranted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right to Bear Arms -- Prohibition of Assault Weapons and Large-Capacity Magazines</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In an action challenging the constitutionality of the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act (SAFE Act), the core prohibitions of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines contained in the SAFE Act did not violate the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. Accepting for purposes of discussion that the SAFE Act substantially burdened the right to keep and bear arms so as to subject it to Second Amendment scrutiny, and assuming that the weapons and feeding devices addressed were not the type of dangerous and exotic weaponry that merited no Second Amendment protection, the challenged provisions were subject to intermediate scrutiny, surviving if they bear a substantial relationship to the achievement of an important governmental objective. With regard to the SAFE Act's objective, New York has compelling governmental interests in public safety and crime prevention. Plaintiff challengers provided no proof to call the well-established premise behind the challenged provisions into question, namely, that the governmental interest in public safety is substantially furthered by reducing access to weapons designed to quickly fire significant amounts of ammunition and the ammunition feeding devices required to hold that ammunition. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ISSUE: Was a motorist's application for an order, granting him a new driver's license and declaring emergency regulations under 15 NYCRR 136.5&nbsp;unconstitutional, properly dismissed. HOLDINGS: [1]-The motorist's challenges to regulatory provisions imposing a lifetime license revocation and requiring the issuance of a restricted license and the installation of an ignition interlock device were nonjusticiable; [2]-The New York Legislature did not preempt the field of driving while under the influence law by enacting Vehicle and Traffic Law art. 31 because the Legislature vested the New York State Commissioner of Motor Vehicles with broad authority to promulgate regulations to regulate and control the exercise of the New York State Department of Motor Vehicle's powers (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 215(a)); [3]-15 NYCRR 136.5(b)(3) did not conflict with Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193(2)(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Justiciable Questions -- Regulations Affecting Relicensing of Recidivist Drivers by Department of Motor Vehicles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a combined CPLR article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action, Supreme Court properly dismissed, as nonjusticiable, petitioner's challenges to regulations adopted by respondent Department of Motor Vehicles that impose a lifetime license revocation upon certain recidivist drivers and require the issuance of a restricted license and the installation of an ignition interlock device. A controversy is justiciable when the plaintiff in an action for a declaratory judgment has an interest sufficient to constitute standing to maintain the action. As to the challenge to the lifetime license revocation, petitioner did not have five or more alcohol- or drug-related driving convictions or incidents during his lifetime, or three or four alcohol- or drug-related driving convictions or incidents and a &quot;serious driving offense&quot; (15 NYCRR 136.5 [a] [2]) within a 25-year look-back period; thus, he was not subject to a lifetime license revocation under the regulatory scheme (15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [1], [2]). As for his challenge to the imposition of a restricted license and the installation of an ignition interlock device (15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [3] [ii]), such harm could not eventuate until petitioner's revocation period had expired and, even then, only if a relicensing application was subsequently approved by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Alternatively, petitioner could apply for and be granted an exemption from the restricted license and ignition interlock device requirements (15 NYCRR 136.5 [d]). As the harm sought to be enjoined was contingent upon events which might not come to pass, the claim too was nonjusticiable as speculative and abstract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Delegation of Legislative Power -- Relicensing of Recidivist Drivers by Department of Motor Vehicles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature granted the Department of Motor Vehicles regulatory authority over the relicensing of persons with multiple alcohol- and/or drug-related driving offenses, as evidenced by the scope and language of relevant provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. Within the broad regulatory authority vested in the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, he or she has the sole authority to approve or deny relicensing applications, including those submitted by persons whose licenses were revoked for alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;&sect; 215 [a]; 510 [5], [6] [a]; 1193 [2] [c] [1]). Furthermore, while the Vehicle and Traffic Law establishes minimum periods of revocation for alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses, it also provides that revoked licenses may only be restored in the discretion of the Commissioner (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 [2] [c] [1]) and that the Commissioner may, on a case-by-case basis, refuse to restore a license which otherwise would be restored under the statute, in the interest of the public safety and welfare (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 [2] [b] [12]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Separation of Powers -- Promulgation of Regulations Affecting Relicensing of Recidivist Drivers by Department of Motor Vehicles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) did not run afoul of the constitutional separation of powers doctrine by promulgating regulations that impose a lifetime license revocation upon certain recidivist drivers and require the issuance of a restricted license and the installation of an ignition interlock device (15 NYCRR 136.5 [b] [1], [2], [3] [ii]). DMV did not act on its own ideas of public policy, but rather implemented the Legislature's policies of promoting highway safety and reducing instances of impaired and intoxicated driving. Inasmuch as the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles has the discretion to continue license revocations beyond the statutory minimum period (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 [2] [c] [1]) and recidivist drivers pose a heightened risk to the safety of public roadways, DMV promulgated 15 NYCRR 136.5 (b) (3) in furtherance of legislatively-defined policy and thus engaged in permissible, interstitial rulemaking. Furthermore, since the early demise of proposed legislation to impose stricter penalties upon recidivist drivers could be an expression of the Legislature's intent to keep intact the Commissioner's broad discretionary authority over relicensing, it could not be concluded based on that factor alone that DMV exceeded its authority. Moreover, inasmuch as DMV relied on its own empirical data regarding the number of statewide personal injuries and deaths caused by recidivist drivers, a fair amount of expertise was required to promulgate the regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- No Conflict with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Relicensing of Recidivist Drivers by Department of Motor Vehicles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. 15 NYCRR 136.5 (b) (3), which allows the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to impose, in addition to the statutory minimum, a five-year license revocation period upon anyone who has committed three or four alcohol- or drug-related driving offenses within a 25-year look-back period, does not conflict with the Vehicle and Traffic Law. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1193 (2) (b) sets &quot;minimum periods&quot; during which the Commissioner cannot reissue a revoked license, but also vests the Commissioner with complete discretion to determine whether relicensing is appropriate once the statutory minimum revocation period expires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Ex Post Facto Law -- Regulations Affecting Relicensing of Recidivist Drivers by Department of Motor Vehicles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Department of Motor Vehicles' denial of petitioner recidivist driver's request for a new license did not constitute an impermissible retroactive application of 15 NYCRR 136.5 (b) (3) or a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the US Constitution. Legislation is retroactive when it takes away or impairs vested rights or alters past transactions or considerations. However, a driver's license is a personal privilege subject to reasonable restrictions and revocation by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles in his or her discretionary powers, not a vested right. Furthermore, regulations affecting the relicensing of recidivist drivers are not retroactive merely because they permit the consideration of an alcohol- or drug-related driving conviction that occurred before their promulgation to determine a person's eligibility to enjoy the privilege of possessing a driver's license. Moreover, the prohibition contained in the Ex Post Facto Clause of the US Constitution applies only to penal statutes and not to regulations such as those here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-While the trial court could consider defendant's undocumented immigration status in deciding whether he should be incarcerated or placed on probation, in ordering his incarceration, it erred in relying solely on his immigration status to the exclusion of all other relevant factors, as doing so violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. and N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Waiver of Right to Appeal -- Constitutional Claims </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's otherwise valid waiver of the right to appeal did not foreclose his appeal from a judgment convicting him of driving while intoxicated, for which County Court sentenced him to a period of incarceration rather than to a term of probation based solely on his undocumented immigration status. A defendant may not waive his right to appellate review of certain claims, such as constitutional claims that implicate a larger societal interest in their correct resolution which embraces the reality of fairness in the process itself.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review -- Appellate Division -- Interest of Justice Jurisdiction </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The Appellate Division exercised its interest of justice jurisdiction to reach unpreserved issues raised by defendant on his appeal concerning whether County Court's denial of probation in favor of incarceration based solely on defendant's undocumented immigration status violated his constitutional rights. Defendant's appeal raised a novel issue in New York that was likely to reappear in the future, and provided the Court with an opportunity to discuss how and to what extent a defendant's undocumented immigration status may be considered by a sentencing court.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Probation -- Undocumented Immigration Status </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. A defendant's undocumented immigration status may be considered by a sentencing court in determining whether a sentence should include probation, but courts may not rely solely upon a defendant's undocumented immigration status in imposing a sentence of incarceration to the exclusion of all other relevant factors. Accordingly, County Court violated defendant's constitutional rights by denying him probation solely on the basis of his status as an undocumented immigrant under the flawed belief that defendant's continuing violation of federal immigration laws would constitute an automatic violation of the standard conditions of probation. A court's consideration of a defendant's status as an undocumented immigrant is not, in and of itself, a violation of the constitutional separation of powers doctrine. Such consideration is proper given that, pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 65.00 (1) (a), a sentencing court must consider the &quot;history, character and condition of the defendant.&quot; However, a sentencing court's refusal to consider a sentence of probation for an undocumented defendant solely on the basis of his or her immigration status violates the Due&nbsp;Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal and New York Constitutions by treating certain defendants differently from others based upon their undocumented presence in this state. Nothing would have prevented County Court from modifying the standard conditions of probation to provide that, while defendant must obey all laws, his undocumented immigration status would not be a basis, in and of itself, for the filing of a violation of probation petition. A sentencing court may consider, in a proper case, potential ways to modify the standard conditions if the defendant might otherwise be an appropriate candidate for probation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Search Warrant -- Warrant Served on Online Social Networking Service -- Pre-Enforcement Challenge on Behalf of Target </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petitioner, an online social networking service, could not litigate on its customers' behalf the constitutionality of digital search warrants for customer accounts obtained in connection with a large-scale investigation into the fraudulent filing of Social Security disability claims prior to enforcement. There is no constitutional or statutory right to challenge an alleged defective warrant before it is executed and there was no basis for providing petitioner a greater right than the targets of the warrants are afforded. The sole remedy for challenging the legality of a warrant under the Criminal Procedure Law is by a pretrial suppression motion as there is no mechanism for a motion to quash a search warrant or for taking an appeal from a denial of such a motion. Petitioner's motion to quash the search warrants could not be considered as analogous to a motion to quash a subpoena. While the warrants were issued prior to any pending criminal proceeding, the relief petitioner sought would necessarily impact the subsequent criminal actions. Further, petitioner did not have the right to contest the warrants under the Stored Communications Act (18 USC &sect;&sect; 2701-2712) (SCA), which provides an Internet Service Provider (ISP) with the right to contest any order or subpoena served upon it. Section 2703 (d) gives the ISP the right to object to court orders and subpoenas issued under section 2703 (b) or (c). The SCA is not a catchall statute designed to protect the privacy of stored Internet communications and it distinguishes disclosure devices under subsections (b) and (c) from warrants which are governed by subsection (a) and require the government to make the traditional and more stringent showing of probable cause. As a finding of probable cause was made by the reviewing judge, the warrants, which required petitioner to disclose electronic content in its electronic storage, were akin to SCA section 2703 (a) warrants. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The trial court properly declared that the 2001 amendments to a city's adult use zoning regulation violated the First Amendment, because, while the amendments were justified as a measure to eradicate the potential for sham compliance with the original ordinance and the signage evidence in the adult video and book stores had been changed to reduce the adult focus and there was no evidence in the record that the floor configurations made the non-adult sections difficult to access, most of the book and video stores and the adult eating and drinking establishments retained a predominant, ongoing focus on sexually explicit activities that included peep shows, topless dancing, and lap dancing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Zoning Amendments Restricting Adult Establishments </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 2001 amendments to New York City Zoning Resolution &sect; 12-10, enacted to address concern that certain adult establishments (60/40 establishments), while superficially complying with 1995 zoning amendments requiring that at least 60% of their business be devoted to nonadult uses, retained a predominant, ongoing focus on sexually explicit materials or activities, were an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment. To prove its theory that the 60/40 establishments' technical compliance with the 1995 amendments was merely a sham, defendant municipality bore the burden of establishing that the essential characteristics or features of the 60/40 uses were similar to those adult uses that were previously found to cause negative secondary effects in the community, based upon criteria such as the presence of large signs advertising adult content, a significant emphasis on the promotion of materials exhibiting &quot;specified sexual activities&quot; or &quot;specified anatomical areas,&quot; the exclusion of minors from the premises on the basis of age, and difficulties in accessing nonadult materials. Most of the signage of the adult bookstores and video stores was not graphic, and there was no evidence that any of the stores had adult signs that were larger than those of nearby nonadult businesses, or that the signs advertising adult content were large. The signs had been significantly modified, and signs advertising nonadult stock had been added so as to limit, if not eliminate, any emphasis on adult material. Although the stores still placed a significant emphasis on promoting sexually focused adult materials and activities, most of the stores kept the nonadult materials in the front of the stores. With respect to adult eating and drinking establishments, although the evidence clearly demonstrated an emphasis on the promotion of materials exhibiting &quot;specified sexual activities&quot; or &quot;specified anatomical areas,&quot; indicating a predominant sexual focus, there was little to no evidence presented as to the nature of the outward signage and the difficulty in accessing the nonadult material or the nonadult section. There was also no evidence presented as to the nature of the pre-1994 or 100% clubs. That the 60/40 clubs regularly featured topless dancing did not automatically mean that they retained a predominant sexual focus. </SPAN></P>

The disputed assets converted water to steam and steam to water and were continuously engaged, even when the turbines were shut down and no electricity was being produced. As all of the disputed assets were necessary to the power plants' ultimate purpose of producing electricity and the separate components created water and steam only to serve that purpose, it was not irrational for the Tribunal to analyze the disputed assets as part of the larger system and conclude that the claimed assets were principally used in the production of electricity rather than water or steam. Even when analyzed in isolation, there was a rational basis for the Tribunal's determination that the assets were not engaged in manufacturing or processing. The ongoing conversion of water to steam and then back to its original form as water made no permanent change in the water and yielded no final product, making it more akin to recycling.  </SPAN></P>

While the federal government has exclusive authority under the doctrine of preemption to regulate the construction and operation of nuclear power plants, making a tax credit available to an eligible taxpayer does not constitute controlling the taxpayer's activities or processes. Tax Law former &sect; 210 (12) (b) (iii) merely set out the criteria for eligibility for pollution tax credits and charged DEC with certifying that those criteria were met. If the preemption doctrine prevented state governments from establishing eligibility criteria for tax credits for nuclear power plants, it would necessarily also prevent them from allowing tax credits to such facilities at all. Petitioner failed to show that, in charging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with the duty to regulate the operation and construction of nuclear power plants, it was also the clear and manifest purpose of Congress to preempt the allowance of state tax credits to such facilities or the establishment of criteria for such credits.  </SPAN></P>

Petitioner neither showed that it met the requirements for certification nor that it was treated differently from similarly situated taxpayers and petitioner did not negate every conceivable basis which might support the certification requirement.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy of respondent Administrative Board of the Courts of New York State that &quot;no judge henceforth certificated for service as a Justice of the Supreme Court pursuant to Judiciary Law &sect; 115 may receive, concurrent with receipt of a salary for such service, a retirement allowance for prior judicial service within the Unified Court System&quot; violated Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 212, Judiciary Law &sect; 115 (3) and NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 7. Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 212 (1) explicitly allows New York public employees, including Supreme Court Justices, to retire in place and continue to work while collecting their state pension, without mention of employers or an employer's discretion to condition recertification upon suspension of a statutory right. Moreover, the statute's history supports the conclusion that the legislature intended to give such a right to public employees, not subject to diminishment based on an employer's interests. Respondent's policy effectively created two classes of justices: those who could receive either private retirement benefits or solely nonjudicial public service retirement benefits, and those who were eligible for judicial public service retirement benefits but were not allowed to receive them. Judiciary Law &sect; 115 does not empower respondent to make a certificated judgeship a lesser class of employment than a noncertificated judgeship. A certificated judge is a justice of the Supreme Court in the district in which he or she resides for purposes that include &quot;salary&quot; and &quot;rights&quot; (Judiciary Law &sect; 115 [3]; NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [b]). Nor does a Supreme Court Justice's pension-taking fall under the category of necessity when determining a justice's eligibility for certification (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [b]).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ISSUE: Whether applicant, an undocumented immigrant authorized to be present in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy and otherwise eligible for admission to the bar, could satisfy the standard of good character and general fitness. [1]-To the extent 8 USC.S. &sect; 1621(d) required a state law to be the sole mechanism by which New York exercised its authority under &sect; 1621(d) to opt out of &sect; 1621(a)'s restrictions on the issuance of law licenses, it unconstitutionally infringed on the State's authority to divide power among its three branches of government; [2]-The judiciary's authority under Judiciary Law &sect; 53(1) to regulate the granting of law licenses included opting out of &sect; 1621(a)'s restrictions to the extent they applied to the admission of attorneys to the bar; [3]-Applicant's immigration status did not reflect adversely on his competence to practice law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and Client -- Admission to Practice -- Undocumented Immigrants -- Admission Eligibility </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An undocumented immigrant, who is authorized to be present in the United States under the auspices of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy of the federal government, and who meets the statutory eligibility requirements and the rules of court governing admission to the practice of law in the State of New York, may satisfy the standard of good character and general fitness necessary for admission. Nor is such an individual barred from admission to the practice of law by 8 USC &sect; 1621, which generally prohibits the issuance of state professional licenses to undocumented immigrants unless an individual state has enacted legislation affirmatively authorizing the issuance of such licenses. The undocumented status of an individual applicant does not, alone, suggest that the applicant is not possessed of the qualities that enable attorneys to vigorously defend their client's interests within the bounds of the law, nor does it suggest that the applicant cannot protect, as an officer of the court, the rule of law and the administration of justice. Further, a narrow reading of 8 USC &sect; 1621 (d), so as to require a state legislative enactment to be the sole mechanism by which the State of New York exercises its authority granted in 8 USC &sect; 1621 (d) to opt out of the restrictions on the issuance of licenses imposed by 8 USC &sect; 1621 (a), unconstitutionally infringes under the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution on the sovereign authority of the State to divide power among its three coequal branches of government. In light of New York's allocation of authority to the judiciary to regulate the granting of professional licenses to practice law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Judiciary Law &sect; 53 [1]), the judiciary may exercise its authority as the state sovereign to opt out of the restrictions imposed by section 1621 (a) to the limited extent that those restrictions apply to the admission of attorneys to the practice of law in the State of New York. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In related RPTL article 7 proceedings challenging respondents' 2008, 2009, and 2010 assessments of petitioner's real property, the three-year moratorium of RPTL 727 (1) was applicable, based upon a consent judgment reducing the assessment for the years 2006 and 2007 entered in tax certiorari proceedings commenced by the prior owner of the property, warranting dismissal of the petitions. RPTL 727 (1), which provides that when an assessment is found to be unlawful, unequal, excessive or misclassified by a final court order or judgment, &quot;the assessed valuation so determined shall not be changed for such property for the next three succeeding [annual] assessment rolls,&quot; applies, even where, as here, the final order or judgment is entered upon stipulation of the parties. The plain language of RPTL 727 (1) imposes a moratorium upon further challenges to the property's tax assessment for a three-year period which, in this instance, comprised the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. Petitioner's own tax proceedings could not qualify as the &quot;final order or judgment&quot; for the moratorium to be measured against, as petitioner's proceedings resulted in no judicial findings that the assessed valuations for 2008 through 2010 were &quot;unlawful, unequal, excessive or misclassified,&quot; as expressly required by RPTL 727 (1).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In related RPTL article 7 proceedings challenging respondents' 2008, 2009, and 2010 assessments of petitioner's real property, the three-year moratorium on tax certiorari proceedings provided in RPTL 727 (1) was applicable, based upon a consent judgment reducing the assessment for the years 2006 and 2007 entered in tax certiorari proceedings commenced by the prior owner of the property, despite the change in the property's ownership. The recognized exceptions to the three-year moratorium address situations where changes in circumstances defeat the statute's purpose of locking in judicially settled assessments to maintain the status quo, because the changed circumstances themselves upset the status quo (RPTL 727 [2]). A change in a property's ownership is not listed in the statute as an exception, and under the doctrine of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, the presence of exceptions in RPTL 727 (2), without inclusion of a property sale exception among them, must be inferentially construed as the Legislature's intent not to except circumstances where property is sold to a new owner. Logically, the sale of property to a purchaser would not be an appropriate exception to include within the enumerated exceptions of RPTL 727 (2), as such an exception might encourage sales to &quot;straw buyers&quot; as a means of circumventing the three-year moratorium of RPTL 727 (1) and thereby defeat the purpose of the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment -- Three-Year Moratorium on Tax Certiorari Proceedings -- Constitutionality of Application to Successor Property Owner </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In related RPTL article 7 proceedings challenging respondents' 2008, 2009, and 2010 assessments of petitioner's real property, the application of the three-year moratorium on tax certiorari proceedings provided in RPTL 727 (1), based upon a consent judgment reducing the assessment for the years 2006 and 2007 entered in tax certiorari proceedings commenced by the prior owner of the property, was not unconstitutional. Petitioner could have undertaken procedural steps to participate in the negotiations that resulted in the assessment reduction, but did not do so. Despite being aware of the prior owner's proceedings and of settlement negotiations that lasted for approximately a year, and aware that those proceedings could affect its pecuniary interests, petitioner made no timely effort to intervene in those proceedings or to join or consolidate them with its own tax certiorari proceedings. Thus, petitioner was not a &quot;noncomplicit transferee,&quot; as it had negotiated the purchase of the property fully cognizant of the prior owner's tax proceedings, as demonstrated by the contract of sale, without negotiating a mechanism for adjusting the purchase price for the property to take into account those ongoing proceedings. Furthermore, the record failed to establish that the reduced $2,618,551 assessment exceeded the property's fair market value so as to render the assessment unconstitutional under New York Constitution, article XVI, &sect; 2. The assessment equated to a market value of $8,250,000, and petitioner had listed the property with a commercial real estate broker for $ 9,750,000. With regard to the property's sale price between the prior owner and petitioner, the sale had all the indicia of a distress sale and was not reflective of a fair market value. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tax certiorari proceeding challenging the assessed valuation of petitioner's property for 2007, where the parties agreed to a reduced assessment for the 2007 tax year and the local school district issued petitioner a refund for the 2007-2008 school tax year pursuant to that agreement, petitioner was also entitled to a refund for the 2008-2009 school tax year, notwithstanding that it did not commence a tax certiorari proceeding for the 2008 tax year. RPTL 727 (1) imposes a three-year freeze to the &quot;next three succeeding assessment rolls&quot; from the &quot;date of the most recent assessment under review&quot; where an order or judgment is issued determining that the assessment is unlawful, unequal, excessive, or misclassified. A stipulation between the parties agreeing to a lower assessment has the same effect. The assessment under review here was for the 2007 tax year, and therefore the assessment rolls from 2008 through 2010 were required to have that same assessment. Thus, the application of RPTL 727 (1) resulted in an automatic reduction in the assessment for the 2008-2009 school tax year, without the need for any filing of a tax certiorari proceeding for the 2008 tax year. Requiring petitioner to commence a tax certiorari proceeding for the 2008-2009 school tax year would go against the interest in reduced litigation contemplated by the statutory respite period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proceeding pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law article 10 seeking civil commitment of respondent as a dangerous sex offender was dismissed on the ground that the State failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that respondent has or will have serious difficulty controlling his behavior. The New York statutory structure requires the State to prove that the individual is dangerous and the dangerousness must be coupled with a mental abnormality, which incorporates the additional requirement that the offender have serious difficulty with behavioral control. Besides relying on respondent's criminal history, which occurred prior to his 33-year incarceration, the State relied primarily on two expert witnesses, both of whom diagnosed respondent as suffering from two abnormalities (paraphilia not otherwise specified [paraphilia NOS] and antisocial personality disorder [ASPD]). However, a diagnosis of ASPD cannot serve as the factual predicate of sexual abnormality under article 10. Moreover, as to paraphilia NOS, neither expert conducted a quantified analysis of the factors that led to their conclusion of lack of control, and concluding that a respondent has a volitional impairment from only a diagnosis of sexual abnormality violates the requirement that the State prove separately from the abnormality that a sex offender has serious difficulty controlling his behavior. The concept of predisposition and volition are separate and distinct. Respondent spent 33 consecutive years in prison and there was no evidence that he engaged in any inappropriate sexual behavior during that prolonged period to suggest that he had serious difficulty controlling his behavior in such an environment. Rather, defendant voluntarily attended anger management and sex offender treatment programs while in prison. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Respondents, the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP) and its Commissioner, did not usurp the legislature's prerogative by promulgating 9 NYCRR 386.1, which establishes smoke-free areas in certain limited outdoor locations under OPRHP's jurisdiction and prohibits smoking in each state park located in New York City, with limited exceptions (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;9 NYCRR 386.1 [a] [2]). OPRHP did not improperly balance economic and social concerns against its stated goal in order to act on its own ideas of sound public policy. All aspects of the regulation are grounded in OPRHP's stated purpose--to allow all patrons to enjoy the fresh air and natural beauty of its outdoor facilities; the choices made by OPRHP were not very difficult or complex; and the designation of no smoking areas is not a continued subject of great public debate. Furthermore, OPRHP did not write on a clean slate, creating its own comprehensive set of rules. The legislature has instructed OPRHP to &quot;[o]perate and maintain&quot; its sites while &quot;[p]rovid[ing] for the health, safety and welfare of the public using [those sites]&quot; (PRHPL 3.09 [2], [5]). Nor did OPRHP improperly intrude upon an area that is a matter of legislative debate. Finally, sufficient agency expertise from OPRHP was required to enact the rule such that it did not intrude upon legislative authority. OPRHP considered the nature of the properties under its jurisdiction in order to determine how best to locate the no smoking areas, as evidenced by the rule's treatment of parks in New York City, which differ in size and setting from the parks elsewhere in the state.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- Smoke-Free Regulation Promulgated by Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation -- Applicability of Regulation to State Parks Located in New York City</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. 9 NYCRR 386.1, which establishes smoke-free areas in certain limited outdoor locations under the jurisdiction of respondent Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP), was not arbitrary and capricious in that it treated state parks located in New York City differently from those throughout the rest of the state. Pursuant to 9 NYCRR 386.1, smoking is prohibited throughout state parks located in New York City, except that the Commissioner of OPRHP may allow smoking in limited areas, whereas, in parks throughout the rest of the state, smoking is permitted except in designated nonsmoking areas. As determined by respondents, the greater restriction in New York City parks was due to their smaller size, which permitted patrons to easily walk to an area outside of a park to smoke. Furthermore, since smoking was already prohibited in New York City's public parks, respondents determined that the nearby state parks should be managed in a consistent manner. OPRHP's different treatment of parks located in New York City was not unreasonable. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-An amendment barring reimbursement of petitioner county's Medicaid claims was not unconstitutional because it did not retroactively extinguish a vested right to reimbursement, under Social Services Law &sect; 368-a(1)(h), but only imposed a statute of limitations; [3]-A failure to set a grace period was cured because the statute was interpreted to permit filing otherwise time-barred claims within six months of the reversal of the trial court's declaration that the amendment was unconstitutional; [4]-It was no error to order respondent Department of Health (DOH) to pay the county's claims because Social Services Law &sect; 368-a(1) stated DOH &quot;shall&quot; reimburse such expenditures without requiring a claim, and the state could not avoid this duty, so the county was entitled to mandamus relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Medicaid Reimbursement Payments -- Reimbursement of Overburden Expenditures -- Timeliness of Claims</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The 2012 amendment (L 2012, ch 56, &sect; 1, part D, &sect; 61) to the Medicaid Cap Statute (L 2005, ch 58, &sect; 1, part C, &sect; 1), cited by respondent Department of Health as the basis for denying petitioner county's reimbursement claims for overburden expenditures incurred prior to 2006, is not unconstitutional since it did not retroactively extinguish petitioner's vested right to such reimbursement pursuant to Social Services Law &sect; 368-a (1) (h). Under Social Services Law &sect; 368-a (1) (h), petitioner's right to reimbursement of overburden expenditures accrued when it made payment to the State for those expenses for which no local share was owed, i.e., prior to January 1, 2006. The 2012 amendment did not specifically repeal any part of Social Services Law &sect; 368-a or affect the counties' inherent right to reimbursement. Rather, the amendment simply imposed a statute of limitations for the payment of reimbursement claims by barring claims submitted after a certain date. A statute of limitations does not impair an underlying substantive right, but may deprive a litigant of any remedy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Retroactive Application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- New Statute of Limitations for Submission of Certain Medicaid Reimbursement Claims to State -- Procedural Due Process -- Reasonable Grace Period</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Social services districts may submit claims to the Department of Health for the reimbursement of any pre-2006 overburden expenditures pursuant to Social Services Law &sect; 368-a (1) (h) within six months of the Appellate Division's reversal of the Supreme Court's declaration that the 2012 amendment (L 2012, ch 56, &sect; 1, part D, &sect; 61) to the Medicaid Cap Statute (L 2005, ch 58, &sect; 1, part C, &sect; 1) was unconstitutional; any claims submitted thereafter are barred as untimely. Although potential litigants have no right or vested interest in any specific limitations period, when a limitations period is statutorily shortened, or created where none existed before, due process requires a reasonable grace period before the time bar takes effect. While the legislature did not expressly set a grace period in the 2012 amendment, the constitutional validity of the retrospective application of a new statute may be upheld by interpreting it as permitting the filing, within a reasonable time after the statute's effective date, of claims that would otherwise be time-barred. However, due to possible reliance by potential claimants on Supreme Court's declaration that the 2012 amendment was unconstitutional, it was reasonable to run the grace period from the date of the Appellate Division's decision reversing that declaration, rather than from the enactment of the statute.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Mandamus -- Department of Health's Reimbursement for Medicaid Overburden Expenditures Incurred by County</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Since respondent Department of Health's obligation to reimburse social services districts for Medicaid overburden expenditures is mandatory and ministerial and does not involve any discretion, petitioner county was entitled to a writ of mandamus requiring respondent to review its records to identify any individuals who may not have been properly coded as overburden patients, and all medical services that were provided to individuals who were or were not properly coded as overburden patients, then process all pre-2006 overburden expenditure reimbursements to petitioner. Social Services Law &sect; 368-a (1) states that respondent &quot;shall&quot; reimburse petitioner for, among other things, overburden expenditures; the statute does not include any requirement that petitioner make a claim for those payments. Thus, respondent Commissioner was required to pay those reimbursements even without any claims being made, and should have done so by 2006. </SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, and the Due Process Clause, N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 were not violated as &sect; 167(1)(a) did not employ terms that signalled an intent to create a contractual or vested right; [3]-Section 167(1)(a) reflected a policy determination as to the State's contribution rate towards retiree health insurance premiums that was subject to change at the will of the legislature; [4]-Section 167(8) was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority as the standard provided in &sect; 167(8) provided adequate guidance for the state agency's exercise of its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Retirement and Pension Benefits -- Reduction in State's Percentage Contribution Toward Retirees' Health Insurance Premiums</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a hybrid CPLR article 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action by petitioners, former New York State employees receiving a fixed percentage retirement allowance from the state pursuant to Civil Service Law &sect;167 (1) (a), challenging the state's reduced contribution towards their health insurance benefits after the state and an employee organization entered into a collective bargaining agreement that reduced the state's contribution to current employees' health insurance premiums, respondents' extension of the reduced contribution rates to petitioners was lawful and in compliance with Civil Service Law &sect;167. Nothing in the language of Civil Service Law &sect;167 (1) (a) constituted clear and irresistible evidence that the legislature intended to create a contractual or vested right to the higher contribution rates set forth therein. In amending section 167, the legislature's use of the phrase &quot;[n]otwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law&quot; in subdivision (8) expressed its intent to preempt any other potentially conflicting statute, including the fixed contribution rates set forth in subdivision (1) (a). The legislature also expressly granted the Civil Service Commission the discretion to extend modifications in contribution rates to &quot;employees or retirees&quot; not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the plain and unambiguous language of Civil Service Law &sect;167 (8) permitted reductions in the state's contribution towards petitioners' health insurance premiums in the event that a collective bargaining agreement between the state and an employee organization so provided. Moreover, since the Commission's discretion was entirely dependent upon and limited by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, reasonable safeguards and standards were in place such that the statute did not amount to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers made a compelling argument that under the previous law, those payments were not taxable by New York; [3]-The three-and-one-half year length of the retroactive period favored the taxpayers; [4]-The public purpose for retroactive application factor favored the taxpayers as raising money for the state budget did not warrant retroactivity where the other factors militated against it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An amendment to section 632 (a) (2) of the Tax Law was impermissibly applied retroactively to a transaction entered into by plaintiff nonresident taxpayers more than 3&frac12; years earlier. Plaintiffs reasonably relied on the old law in structuring their transaction, and had no forewarning of the change in the legislation. In light of plaintiffs' reliance on the prior law, the excessive length of the retroactive period, and the absence of a compelling public purpose, a due process violation occurred by the retroactive application of the statute.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Plaintiff taxpayers satisfied the first prong of three-prong test to determine whether the retroactive application of a tax statute passes constitutional muster with regard to an amendment to section 632 (a) (2) of the Tax Law, which changed the manner of computing the tax on a taxpayer's sale of stock of a subchapter S corporation. Plaintiffs had no actual forewarning of the change made by the amendment, which was not even proposed to the legislature until long after plaintiffs had entered into the transaction which the state sought to tax retroactively. Thus, plaintiffs had no warning and no opportunity to alter their behavior in anticipation of the impact of the amendment. Plaintiffs made a compelling argument that under the previous law the payments for the sale of the stock of their subchapter S corporation were not taxable, and, hence, they reasonably relied on existing law to conclude that those payments were not taxable. While defendants asserted that there was a long-standing policy of taxing transactions similar to plaintiffs', the record contained no evidence that the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance took any steps to inform taxpayers of that policy. Plaintiffs were not required to seek an advisory opinion from the Department before entering into the transaction in question, inasmuch as a reasonable reading of the Tax Law as it then existed was that the transaction was not subject to New York tax. Moreover, the law does not require plaintiffs to show a specific proposed alternative course of action to demonstrate that they reasonably relied on the existing scheme of taxation.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Plaintiff taxpayers satisfied the second prong of three-prong test to determine whether the retroactive application of a tax statute passes constitutional muster with regard to an amendment to section 632 (a) (2) of the Tax Law, which changed the manner of computing the tax on a taxpayer's sale of stock of a subchapter S corporation, where the amendment was enacted some 3&frac12; years prior to the challenged transaction, nearly three times longer than a period that had been found excessive by the Court of Appeals in a prior case examining the retroactive applicability of statutes (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">James Sq. Assoc. LP v Mullen</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 21 NY3d 233, 993 NE2d 374, 970 NYS2d 888 [2013]). The excessive period of retroactivity was long enough so that plaintiffs gained a reasonable expectation that they would secure repose in the existing tax scheme. Moreover, no legislative history was revealed to indicate that the legislature was correcting any specific error in the existing law. Inasmuch as the transaction in question would unquestionably be subject to New York tax under the new law, it could fairly be considered a new tax and a lengthy period of retroactivity would not be warranted.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Plaintiff taxpayers satisfied the third prong of three-prong test to determine whether the retroactive application of a tax statute passes constitutional muster with regard to an amendment to section 632 (a) (2) of the Tax Law, which changed the manner of computing the tax on a taxpayer's sale of stock of a subchapter S corporation, where the public purpose of the amendment was to implement an executive budget by raising tax revenues. Raising money for the state budget is not a particularly compelling justification and is insufficient to warrant retroactivity where, as here, other factors, such as the lack of any warning of the change to the taxpayers and the excessive length of the retroactive period, militated against it. Inasmuch as plaintiffs were merely following the law as it then existed, it could not be considered either a &quot;windfall&quot; or unfair for them to escape additional taxation resulting from the retroactive application of the amendment. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Resentencing under Drug Law Reform Act -- Eligibility -- Parolees</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonincarcerated parolees are eligible for resentencing under CPL 440.46 (1), which, originally codified under the 2009 Drug Law Reform Act (DLRA), allows persons in the &quot;custody&quot; of the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) and serving sentences for certain drug-related offenses to seek resentencing. Under Executive Law &sect; 259-i (2) (b), parolees are within the &quot;legal custody&quot; of DOCCS, and CPL 440.46 (1) does not distinguish between incarcerated persons and parolees for purposes of determining custodial eligibility for resentencing. Previously, only persons in the &quot;custody&quot; of the Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) were allowed to apply for resentencing (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 2009, ch 56, &sect; 1, part AAA, &sect; 9 [enacting CPL 440.46 (1)]), and, at that time, parolees were in the &quot;legal custody&quot; of the Division of Parole (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Executive Law &sect; 259-i [former (2) (b)]). Thus, only incarcerated offenders were eligible for resentencing. Upon the subsequent merger of DOCS and the Division of Parole into DOCCS, however, CPL 440.46 (1) was amended to permit any otherwise qualified person in the &quot;custody&quot; of DOCCS to apply for resentencing. Moreover, the 2009 DLRA's purpose was to grant relief to low-level nonviolent drug offenders from inordinately harsh punishments, and, in effecting the DOCCS merger, the legislature sought to provide for a seamless network for care, custody, treatment and supervision from the commencement of a person's sentence of state imprisonment until his or her discharge from supervision in the community. It is entirely consistent with that legislative history that the legislature chose not to exclude parolees from resentencing relief. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The supreme court erred in declaring that compensation of judges and justices of the Unified Court System of the State of New York was increased under L 2009, ch. 51, &sect; 3 because the Legislature did not adjust judicial compensation through the enactment of L 2009, ch. 51, &sect; 3; [2]-The statute merely appropriated a lump sum for compensation adjustments, and nothing in the plain language of the statute established, within that gross amount, what monies were to be specifically paid to the justices and what lesser or greater sums were to be paid to the jurists of the other courts of the State; [3]-The new salary schedules the supreme court directed to be implemented based on the plain language of the statute were not only stricken from the enacted version of the statute, but they directly conflicted with the duly-enacted salary schedules contained in Judiciary Law &sect;&sect; 220-224.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Disqualification -- Rule of Necessity</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Appellate Division, Second Department, was required, pursuant to the Rule of Necessity, to determine, in a declaratory judgment action commenced by plaintiffs, judges and justices of the Unified Court System, whether judicial compensation was increased by the legislature through the enactment of Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3. Although the members of the Court had a pecuniary interest in the case and would be affected by the outcome of the appeal, their recusal would leave plaintiffs without a legal remedy as the self-interest implicated by the issues raised on appeal provided grounds for disqualifying not only the members of the Court but also the members of any other judicial body that might have replaced them. The participation of an independent, unbiased adjudicator in the resolution of disputes is an essential element of due process of law. Thus, in order to ensure the dignity of the judiciary and maintain the integrity of the administration of justice, ordinarily, when a judge has an interest in litigation, recusal is warranted. Nevertheless, where all the members of the adjudicative body are disqualified and no other body exists to which the appeal might be referred for disposition, the Rule of Necessity ensures that neither the parties nor the legislature will be left without the remedy provided by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Increases in Judicial Compensation under Laws of 2009, Chapter 51, &sect; 3 -- Statutory Construction -- Plain Language </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a declaratory judgment action commenced by plaintiffs, judges and justices of the Unified Court System, Supreme Court erred in concluding that judicial compensation was increased by the legislature through the enactment of Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3 based upon the plain language of the statute. Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3 contained no language adjusting the salary levels for the various classes of judges and justices, and an interpretation of the statute that transferred the authority to set the salary levels, sub silentio, to the Chief Judge would violate the Compensation Clause of the New York State Constitution. The Compensation Clause requires judicial compensation to be set by the legislature through the enactment of affirmative legislation (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25 [a]), and, pursuant to that directive, the legislature enacted Judiciary Law article 7-B, which sets forth the salaries to be paid to the various classes of judges and justices. Although Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3 appropriated a gross amount of money &quot;[f]or expenses necessary to fund adjustments in the compensation of state-paid judges and justices of the unified court system,&quot; nothing in the plain language of the statute established, within that gross amount, what monies were to be specifically paid to the various classes of judges and justices. Supreme Court's determination that the gross amount was to be disbursed by the Chief Judge pursuant to the salary schedule proposed by the judiciary in its budget request for the relevant year ran afoul of the Compensation Clause inasmuch as the judiciary's proposed salary schedule was not enacted as part of Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Increases in Judicial Compensation under Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3 -- Statutory Construction -- Legislative Intent </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a declaratory judgment action commenced by plaintiffs, judges and justices of the Unified Court System, consideration of extrinsic information evincing legislative intent failed to establish that the legislature intended to increase judicial compensation through the enactment of Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3. The legislature's decision not to explicitly repeal or revise Judiciary Law article 7-B, which sets forth the salaries to be paid to the various classes of judges and justices, constituted evidence that additional legislation was required before the funds appropriated by Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3 for adjustments in judicial compensation could be disbursed. Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3 appropriated funds for adjustments in judicial compensation but omitted proposed language indicating that the adjustments would be accomplished &quot;[pursuant to a subsequent chapter of law specifying such salary levels].&quot; Although, in previous years, similarly enacted appropriations included such references to future legislation, the omission thereof from Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3 did not evince a legislative intent to effect an increase in judicial compensation as the legislature did not amend Judiciary Law article 7-B or otherwise direct the disbursement of the appropriated funds. Moreover, during the floor debates, members of the legislature expressed the view that the adjustment of judicial salaries could not take place without repeal or amendment of Judiciary Law article 7-B, notwithstanding the elimination of the reference to future legislation. Finally, the legislature struck from Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3 the judiciary's proposed salary schedule that would have effectively repealed Judiciary Law article 7-B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Judicial Salaries -- Increases in Judicial Compensation under Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3 -- Statutory Construction -- Repeal by Implication </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3, which appropriated funds for adjustments in judicial compensation, did not repeal by implication Judiciary Law article 7-B, which sets forth the salaries to be paid to the various classes of judges and justices of the Unified Court System and thereby effect an increase in judicial compensation. The funds appropriated by Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3 could be reconciled with Judiciary Law article 7-B inasmuch as, in prior years, the legislature had similarly directed that funds be set aside but had not effected an increase in judicial compensation by failing to repeal or revise Judiciary Law article 7-B. Repeal by implication results from an enactment, the terms and operation of which cannot be harmonized with the terms and necessary effect of an earlier statute. The repeal of a statute by implication is, however, not favored by the law because, when the legislature intends to repeal an act, it usually says so expressly. As laws are presumed to be passed with deliberation and full knowledge of all the existing ones on the same subjects, it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature, in passing a statute, did not intend to interfere with or abrogate any former law relating to the same matter, unless the repugnancy between the two is irreconcilable. Here, the legislature, in enacting Laws of 2009, chapter 51, &sect; 3, was continuing upon the same course it had established in preceding years--appropriating funds necessary to implement a salary increase so that one could be effected if and when it was willing to accept and support such an increase by repealing or revising Judiciary Law article 7-B.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Torts -- False Imprisonment -- Wrongful Confinement -- Detention under Improperly Imposed Period of Postrelease Supervision</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Claimant's continued detention and reincarceration for a parole violation based upon a term of postrelease supervision (PRS) administratively imposed by the then Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) after DOCS-imposed PRS was judicially declared invalid in New York (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Garner v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 NY3d 358, 889 NE2d 467, 859 NYS2d 590 [2008]) was not privileged, thus supporting his claim for false imprisonment against defendant State of New York. Even if the arrest warrant based upon claimant's violation of PRS were lawful, the validity and lawfulness of that detention evaporated in the wake of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. When claimant's parole revocation hearing was held two weeks later, defendant did not have the &quot;privilege&quot; to ignore that mandate, or to find claimant to be in violation of any invalid PRS term or to resentence him to the remainder of his term. After </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, claimant was held without justification. Furthermore, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s companion decision, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Sparber</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (10 NY3d 457, 889 NE2d 459, 859 NYS2d 582 [2008]) clearly indicated that the sole remedy for a sentencing court's failure to pronounce a statutorily required period of PRS was to vacate the sentence and remit for a resentencing hearing so that the trial judge can make the required pronouncement. Here, there was no indication that any effort was made by DOCS, the Division of Parole or the District Attorney to bring claimant before a court for resentencing. Even after legislation was passed establishing a mechanism for judicial resentencing, defendant did not take measures to have claimant lawfully resentenced by a court to PRS even as he remained incarcerated on an invalid parole revocation (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Correction Law &sect; 601-d).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Claim against State -- Absolute Immunity -- Parole Decisions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant State of New York was not entitled to absolute immunity for the actions of its parole officers, who continued to detain claimant for a parole violation based upon a term of postrelease supervision (PRS) administratively imposed by the then Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) after DOCS-imposed PRS was judicially declared invalid in New York (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Garner v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 NY3d 358, 889 NE2d 467, 859 NYS2d 590 [2008]). Inherently discretionary parole decisions of government officials have been recognized to be quasi-judicial decisions entitled to absolute immunity. However, after</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> categorically declared DOCS-imposed PRS invalid in this state, defendant's officials no longer had a reasoned basis or jurisdiction to enforce DOCS-imposed PRS and, when they did so, they stepped outside the scope of their authority and acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction and without a colorable claim of authority. Thus, defendant acted without jurisdiction over claimant when it conducted a parole revocation hearing, revoked parole and reincarcerated him, all based upon an alleged violation of a period of PRS that it knew or should have known was a nullity under the controlling rulings of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its companion decision, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Sparber</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (10 NY3d 457, 889 NE2d 459, 859 NYS2d 582 [2008]), as well as under federal law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Claim against State -- Qualified Immunity -- Parole Decisions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Defendant State of New York was not entitled to qualified immunity for the actions of its parole officers, who continued to detain claimant for a parole violation based upon a term of postrelease supervision (PRS) administratively imposed by the then Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) after DOCS-imposed PRS was judicially declared invalid in New York (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Garner v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 NY3d 358, 889 NE2d 467, 859 NYS2d 590 [2008]). Claimant's parole revocation hearing, the revocation of his parole and his reincarceration were prohibited by law after</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> Garner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">categorically declared DOCS-imposed PRS invalid in this state, and claimant's right not to be subjected to such action was clearly established under state and federal law at the time it was taken after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. As a reasonable official would have understood that what he or she was doing violated that right, defendant's actions were not supported by a reasonable basis under existing law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Torts -- Malicious Prosecution -- Detention under Improperly Imposed Period of Postrelease Supervision</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Claimant stated a cause of action for malicious prosecution based upon his continued detention and reincarceration for a parole violation based upon an administratively-imposed term of postrelease supervision (PRS) after DOCS-imposed PRS was judicially declared invalid in New York (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of Garner v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs.,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 NY3d 358, 889 NE2d 467, 859 NYS2d 590 [2008]). Defendant could not ever lawfully prosecute claimant on a parole violation where the PRS in effect at the time of the alleged violation was imposed by the then Department of Correctional Services and was, as such, a nullity under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Garner </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11"> People v Sparber</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (10 NY3d 457, 889 NE2d 459, 859 NYS2d 582 [2008]). Even had claimant been brought before a court for resentencing and the imposition of PRS, he could not thereafter have been found to have violated parole based on an incident that occurred before PRS was lawfully imposed by a court. Claimant's release on a habeas corpus petition, based on the term of his PRS being a nullity, was not inconsistent with his innocence of the parole violation and, thus, it constituted a favorable termination. Furthermore, even if probable cause existed at the time of arrest, it did not exist after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Garner</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so as to authorize defendant to prosecute claimant at a parole revocation hearing on an administratively-imposed period of PRS that was invalid and unconstitutional as a matter of federal due process. Moreover, claimant alleged that defendant had the knowledge and notice that the PRS was invalid or acted with reckless disregard of whether it was valid so as to sufficiently allege actual malice. </SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-As &sect; 250.45 merely required that the recording be surreptitious, it provided defendant fair notice that his actions were prohibited; [2]-The phrase &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; in &sect; 250.45 was not impermissibly vague; [3]-As he made the recordings for his later sexual gratification, and used them to coerce a victim to perform additional sexual acts, the evidence was sufficient to support a determination under &sect; 250.45(3)(b) that he did not have a legitimate purpose for surreptitiously recording the women; [4]-Consolidation of two indictments did not deprive him of a fair trial, as the evidence in one case would have been admissible in the other to show intent and common plan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's surreptitious video recording of women engaging in sexual acts with him in his bedroom constituted prosecutable conduct under the unlawful surveillance in the second degree statute (Penal Law &sect; 250.45), regardless of the consensual nature of the sexual acts. Nothing in the plain language of Penal Law &sect; 250.45 precludes its application to the surreptitious recording of a consensual sexual encounter by one of the participants. The statute's reach is not limited to the actions of a &quot;Peeping Tom.&quot; Furthermore, legislative history indicated that the statute was intended to proscribe the type of conduct engaged in by defendant. One of the circumstances that necessitated the enactment of the statute was the videotaping of women engaged in sexual relations without their knowledge and their lack of a remedy.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The element of surreptitiousness in the unlawful surveillance in the second degree statute (Penal Law &sect; 250.45) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, who video recorded women engaging in sexual acts with him in his bedroom without their knowledge or consent. By its terms, the statute prohibits the use of a device to surreptitiously record, without limitation as to the location of the device (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 250.45 [1], [2], [3] [a]), and is not restricted to circumstances in which a defendant &quot;spies&quot; on the victim from another location while the victim is being recorded. Thus, the fact that the camera was in plain view and both victims were aware of defendant's presence in the room was immaterial, as defendant was using the camera surreptitiously. Inasmuch as the statute merely requires that the recording be surreptitious, it provided fair notice to defendant that his actions were prohibited.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In the prosecution of defendant arising from his video recording of women engaging in sexual acts with him in his bedroom, the People's interpretation of the element of surreptitiousness in the unlawful surveillance in the second degree statute (Penal Law &sect; 250.45) did not impermissibly render superfluous the statute's requirement that the recording be without a victim's knowledge or consent. The People established that neither victim was aware of or consented to defendant recording them while having sex, and also tendered proof that defendant used the camera surreptitiously. The videos showed that the victims were not watching defendant when he began to record. Nor did defendant call the victims' attention to the camera or to the fact that he was recording them. That evidence, which established the element of surreptitiousness, was distinguishable from the evidence that proved the victims' lack of knowledge or consent and gave it independent meaning and effect. Finally, legislative history confirmed that the statute was designed to proscribe the type of conduct engaged in by defendant.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The phrase &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; in the unlawful surveillance in the second degree statute (Penal Law &sect; 250.45 [1], [2]) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, who surreptitiously video recorded women engaging in sexual acts with him in his bedroom. For purposes of Penal Law &sect; 250.45 (1) and (2), such phrase encompasses circumstances in which &quot;a reasonable person would believe that he or she could fully disrobe in privacy&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 250.40 [1]). When a person knowingly undresses and engages in sexual relations with another person, he or she should be able to do so with the reasonable expectation that his or her actions are limited to that particular time and place and that his or her naked body and/or sexual acts will not be memorialized and/or repeatedly viewed at any time by the other person present or by anyone else with whom that person decides to share the recordings. The privacy element, when considered in light of the clear and understandable elements of the criminal conduct proscribed by Penal Law &sect; 250.45 (1) and (2), gave defendant adequate notice and law enforcement sufficient guidance.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The phrase &quot;no legitimate purpose&quot; in the unlawful surveillance in the second degree statute (Penal Law &sect; 250.45 [3] [a]) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, who surreptitiously video recorded women engaging in sexual acts with him in his bedroom. Although the statute does not define &quot;no legitimate purpose,&quot; it prohibits surreptitious recording for purposes generally involving personal gain, for harmful reasons and for salacious and lewd purposes (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 250.45 [1], [2]). Furthermore, where recordings occur in certain places, including bedrooms, it is presumed that there is no legitimate purpose (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 250.45 [3] [b]). Upon review of the statute in its entirety and considering the common understanding of the phrase &quot;no legitimate purpose,&quot; defendant received adequate notice that his surreptitious recording of the victims while they were engaged in a sexual act was unlawful and the statute provided clear standards for enforcement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Surveillance -- One-Party Consent Rule Not Applicable</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. New York's one-party consent rule applicable to, among other things, eavesdropping and audio recording (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 250.00 [1], [2], [6]; CPL 700.05 [9]) is not applicable to the unlawful surveillance in the second degree statute (Penal Law &sect; 250.45), which by its plain language criminalizes the recording of an individual &quot;without such person's knowledge or consent.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Surveillance -- Privacy Element -- Sufficiency of Evidence</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. In the prosecution of defendant for various crimes, including unlawful surveillance in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 250.45), arising from his surreptitious video recording of women engaging in sexual acts with him in his bedroom, the evidence was legally sufficient to establish the element of &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 250.45 [1], [2]) with respect to one of the victims. The victim's testimony and the video itself demonstrated that she was concerned about her privacy, notwithstanding the fact that she was naked in defendant's presence. Defendant and the victim were having sex behind closed doors and the victim testified that she was not aware that she was being recorded and would not have consented thereto. The victim never acknowledged the camera or suggested in any way that, by being naked in defendant's presence, she was forgoing her privacy and giving defendant permission to capture images of her naked body for his future use.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Surveillance -- &quot;No Legitimate Purpose&quot; Element -- Sufficiency of Evidence</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. In the prosecution of defendant for various crimes, including unlawful surveillance in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 250.45), arising from his surreptitious video recording of women engaging in sexual acts with him in his bedroom, the evidence was legally sufficient to establish that defendant lacked a legitimate purpose for recording the victims without their knowledge or consent (Penal Law &sect; 250.45 [3] [a]). Because the recordings were made in defendant's bedroom, the statute established a rebuttable presumption that they were made with no legitimate purpose (Penal Law &sect; 250.45 [3] [b]). Even assuming that the statute would permit a finding that defendant's later sexual gratification was a legitimate purpose, the evidence indicated a more nefarious purpose--defendant's threatening messages to one victim via social media notifying her that she had been recorded implied that he would upload the recording to the Internet. Defendant did more than merely record and later watch the video of that victim; he also created an edited video with a title that included the victim's name and still photographs of her wearing only undergarments.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Consolidation and Severance -- Different Criminal Transactions -- Intent and Common Plan and Scheme</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. County Court properly consolidated the two indictments charging defendant with various crimes arising from his surreptitious video recording of women engaging in sexual acts with him in his bedroom, since proof regarding the events alleged in each of the indictments was relevant to the issues of intent and common plan and scheme (CPL 200.20 [2] [b]). While defendant admitted that he intended to record the victims, he disputed the People's claim that he intended to surreptitiously record them without their knowledge or consent. In that regard, a recording of one victim and defendant's threatening messages to her via social media, which indicated that she was unaware of the recording, were relevant to prove that defendant intended to surreptitiously record the other victim, and vice versa. Moreover, the recordings of both victims tended to show that defendant maintained a camera on the desk in his bedroom, which he would turn on during sexual activity, suggesting a common plan to secretly record women with whom he had sexual encounters, so that he could later use the videos for illegitimate purposes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand Jury -- Defective Proceeding -- Impairment of Integrity of Proceedings -- Expert Witness Present during Victim's Testimony</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. In the prosecution of defendant for various crimes, including unlawful surveillance in the second degree (Penal Law &sect; 250.45), arising from his surreptitious video recording of women engaging in sexual acts with him in his bedroom, the forensics computer expert who performed the search of defendant's laptop and compiled the incriminating videos contained thereon should not have been present in the grand jury room after he completed his testimony and while one of the victims was testifying (CPL 190.25 [3]), but his presence did not impair the integrity of the grand jury proceeding. The expert was asked by the People to remain in the grand jury room in order to assist &quot;as a technician&quot; during the victim's testimony, specifically to play video clips for the grand jurors. By the time the victim testified, the expert had completed his testimony, which related to his role as a forensics computer expert and did not touch on any areas about which the victim testified. In addition, nothing indicated that the expert and the victim worked together during the investigation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Factors Considered</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11. Defendant's sentence to 1 to 3 years on his conviction of unlawful surveillance, consecutive to two concurrent nine-month sentences on coercion convictions and three concurrent one-year sentences on unlawful surveillance convictions, arising from his surreptitious video recording of women engaging in sexual acts with him, was not excessive. The sentencing court carefully considered statements from the People, the victims, and defense counsel, as well as letters from defendant's father and sister, noted defendant's academic and personal accomplishments and his lack of prior criminal history, and reviewed information concerning his medical condition. In concluding that a term of imprisonment was warranted, the court found that there was a &quot;gaping hole&quot; in defendant's character and gave appropriate weight to the devastating and profound effect of defendant's actions upon the victims.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Sex Offender Registration Act -- Unlawful Surveillance</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 12. County Court properly determined to certify defendant as a sex offender upon his conviction of unlawful surveillance and coercion arising from his repeated surreptitious recording of women engaging in sexual acts and his use of coercion to convince one of those women to perform additional sexual acts. As relevant here, a conviction of unlawful surveillance in the second degree under Penal Law &sect; 250.45 (2) and (3) is included as a sex offense &quot;unless upon motion by the defendant, the trial court, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and to the history and character of the defendant, is of the opinion that registration would be unduly harsh and inappropriate&quot; (Correction Law &sect; 168-a [2] [e]). Notwithstanding one expert's opinion that defendant posed a low risk to reoffend, given the nature and circumstances of his crimes, the requirement that defendant register as a sex offender was not unduly harsh and inappropriate. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-When plaintiff judgment creditor sent documents required by CPLR 5222-a to defendant judgment debtor's bank, which did not send the debtor the documents, causing the debtor's account to be restrained without a chance to claim exemptions, due process was violated because the debtor could not assert her rights before her property was taken; [2]-Executing a levy under CPLR 5232 did not make the issue academic because, under CPLR 5222-a, whether enforcing a judgment by a restraining notice or levy execution, the bank had to send proper notice; [3]-The proper remedy was to let the debtor claim exemptions before releasing funds, instead of terminating the execution, because the creditor met its statutory obligations, had no control over the bank, and had a strong interest in satisfying the judgment against the debtor, and the debtor had a strong interest in keeping exempt funds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Supplementary Proceedings -- Restraining Notice -- Bank Account -- Notice to Judgment Debtor </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an action by plaintiff to enforce a judgment against defendant by restraining defendant's bank account under CPLR 5222, the failure of the bank to comply with its obligation under CPLR 5222-a (b) (3) to provide defendant with the restraining notice, exemption notice and exemption claim forms within two business days after receipt of those documents from plaintiff constituted a violation of defendant's due process rights as her account was restrained without her having been afforded notice and an opportunity to claim that any or all of the funds in the account were exempt from debt collection. Upon the issuance of a restraining notice under CPLR 5222, the judgment creditor must serve the banking institution with the restraining notice; an exemption notice advising the judgment debtor that his or her bank account is being restrained, that certain funds are exempt from restraint and of the procedure by which an exemption is claimed; and two exemption claim forms (CPLR 5222-a [b] [1]). Thereafter, the banking institution must, within two business days after receipt of such documents, serve them upon the judgment debtor (CPLR 5222-a [b] [3]). Here, plaintiff properly sent the required documents to the bank, but the bank did not timely send them to defendant. Although plaintiff also executed a levy against the account under CPLR 5232, the bank was required to provide the requisite notice to defendant regardless of whether a restraining notice or levy was employed to enforce the judgment (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPLR 5222-a [a], [b] [3]). Rather than terminate the restraint, however, defendant was afforded the opportunity to claim exemptions before any funds in her account were turned over. </SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-As non-English speakers were not a suspect class, and intentional discrimination based on defendant's ethnicity was not established, the rational basis test applied, and a rational basis for the policy existed--the impracticability of conducting coordination tests through interpreters; [2]-A DWI suspect had no due process right to compel the police to administer a coordination test simply because it might yield information that was helpful to him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Failure to Administer Physical Coordination Tests to Non-English Speaking Person Charged with Driving while Intoxicated -- Standard of Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution for driving while intoxicated in which a non-English speaking defendant of Hispanic origin alleged that the failure of the police to administer physical coordination tests to him when those same tests were administered to English speakers deprived him of equal protection, the trial court erroneously determined that the challenged practice disadvantaged a suspect class, thereby triggering the strict scrutiny that requires the government to establish a compelling justification. Although Hispanics as an ethnic group constitute a suspect class under equal protection analysis, the practice at issue was facially neutral as to ethnicity, since the policy determination as to whether or not to perform physical coordination tests was based on a suspect's ability to speak and understand English, and was not based upon race, religion or national origin. Language, by itself, does not identify members of a suspect class. Moreover, there was nothing in the record to support the trial court's rejection of the police officer's explanation of the policy, or its conclusion that the police chose not to administer a coordination test on the basis of anti-Hispanic animus. The only evidence adduced showed that non-English-speaking suspects were not offered the option of taking a physical coordination test in order to avoid confusion and complications due to a language barrier. Accordingly, since the practice at issue did not burden a suspect class, and intentional discrimination based on ethnicity was not demonstrated, defendant's claim was evaluated under the rational basis analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Failure to Administer Physical Coordination Tests to Non-English Speaking Person Charged with Driving while Intoxicated -- Rational Basis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A rational basis existed for the failure of the police to administer physical coordination tests to a non-English speaking defendant of Hispanic origin suspected of driving while intoxicated when those same tests were routinely administered to English speakers, since the police clearly have an interest in the reliability of coordination tests, and the evidence supported the conclusion that conducting the test through a Spanish-speaking police officer who was not trained in conducting the test could compromise the reliability of the result. Furthermore, there was evidence in the record that it is inherently impracticable to conduct coordination tests through interpreters. While the failure to provide interpreters in judicial or administrative proceedings may give rise to equal protection and due process claims, sobriety coordination tests are merely investigative techniques and are neither judicial nor administrative actions. To require the police department to have qualified interpreters on call on a 24/7 basis would impose unrealistic and substantial financial and administrative burdens. Thus, the avoidance of those crushing obligations provided a rational basis for the policy. Additionally, the time it would take an interpreter to get to a testing site would serve to degrade evidence, as the passage of time impacts sobriety. Accordingly, the policy in question did not violate the equal protection clauses of the Federal and New York State Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process of Law -- Failure to Administer Physical Coordination Tests to Non-English Speaking Person</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It was not an unconstitutional denial of due process for the police to fail to administer physical coordination tests to a non-English speaking defendant of Hispanic origin who was arrested for driving while intoxicated where such tests are routinely administered to English-speaking defendants. While the failure to administer the tests may have deprived defendant of an opportunity to obtain potentially favorable evidence, the police have no affirmative duty to gather or help gather evidence for an accused. Defendant failed to show that the policy of the police department not to administer physical coordination tests to Spanish-speaking suspects presented a great risk that he would be erroneously deprived of his liberty, especially in light of the results of his breathalyzer test results and the arresting officer's observations of defendant at the scene of the arrest, which amply supported the conclusion that defendant was in fact intoxicated. Moreover, the enormous fiscal and administrative burdens associated with maintaining interpreters for non-English speakers on an around-the-clock basis were a legitimate governmental concern.</SPAN></P>

In defendant's prosecution for course of sexual conduct against a child, Supreme Court properly determined that one of the complainants--a seven-year-old child who testified in open court with regard to general background material about her family but became overwhelmed to the point where she was crying and could not respond when questioned about the incident--was a vulnerable witness within the meaning of CPL article 65. Clear and convincing evidence supported the finding that the child was a vulnerable witness. She was likely to suffer serious mental and emotional harm if required to testify in the physical presence of defendant given her &quot;particularly young&quot; age at the time of trial and that defendant--her great uncle by marriage whom she regarded as a family member--occupied a position of authority, was responsible for her care at the time the crime occurred and had frequent contact with her (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 65.20 [10]). Moreover, the emotional trauma the child experienced when she attempted to testify in open court about the crime substantially impaired her ability to communicate with the jury. Furthermore, the child was properly permitted to testify through live two-way closed-circuit television while defendant remained in the courtroom. The record supported the requisite specific finding that placing defendant and the child in the same room during her testimony would contribute to the likelihood that she would suffer severe mental or emotional harm, inasmuch as Supreme Court's observations of the child when she was questioned in the courtroom, and the hearing testimony of a social worker who had met with the child, provided clear and convincing evidence that the cause of the child's severe emotional upset was defendant's presence in the room (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 65.20 [11]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right of Confrontation -- Use of Closed-Circuit Television for Child Witness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution for course of sexual conduct against a child, defendant was not deprived of his federal and state constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him where one of the complainants, a seven-year-old child who became overwhelmed to the point where she was crying and could not respond when questioned about the incident in open court, was determined to be a vulnerable witness within the meaning of CPL article 65 and permitted to testify via closed-circuit television outside defendant's physical presence. The evidence established the likelihood that the child would suffer severe mental or emotional harm if required to testify in defendant's physical presence as required by the statute (CPL 65.20 [12]). Moreover, the child testified by way of two-way closed-circuit television, so that she could see defendant during her testimony and defendant could see her, allowing for face-to-face confrontation. Furthermore, as the prosecutor and defense counsel were in the room with the child and provisions were made for defense counsel and defendant, who remained in the courtroom, to communicate with each other during the testimony, defendant's confrontation rights were not violated. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an action to recover damages for personal injuries which was &quot;marked off&quot; the calendar and later marked &quot;disposed&quot; prior to the filing of a note of issue due to plaintiffs' failure to appear at a status conference, Supreme Court properly denied defendant's cross motion made more than 12 years later to dismiss the complaint based on the doctrine of laches since the action was never properly dismissed and defendant had not made a 90-day written demand on plaintiffs to serve and file a note of issue. Absent a 90-day demand pursuant to CPLR 3216 (b), a court has no power to dismiss an action for general delay. Moreover, given that the case was at a pre-note-of-issue stage, the acts of designating the case &quot;marked off&quot; and &quot;disposed&quot; were a nullity and meant nothing because there was no calendar from which to mark it off of and marking a case off a motion or conference calendar does not dispose of it. Laches does not provide an alternate route to dismissal where a defendant has not served the 90-day demand statutorily required to prompt resumption of the litigation. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Witnesses -- Presence of Therapeutic Comfort Dog during Testimony of Child Witness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution arising from allegations that defendant engaged in multiple acts of sexual misconduct against his daughter, County Court properly allowed the presence of a therapeutic comfort dog at the witness stand during the 15-year-old victim's testimony under Executive Law &sect;642-a and as an exercise of its inherent power and discretion to control the trial proceedings. Executive Law &sect;642-a, entitled &quot;Fair treatment of child victims as witnesses,&quot; provides in subdivision (4) that a trial judge &quot;should be sensitive to the psychological and emotional stress a child witness may undergo when testifying.&quot; The legislative intent behind the passage of section 642-a reveals that the statute was intended to cover child victims and witnesses who were under the age of 16 years. Given that the victim here was between the ages of 11 and 15 years when the criminal acts committed against her took place, the trial court properly concluded that she came within the purview of the statute. Since the language of subdivision (4) is so general that it can only be interpreted as authorizing a trial judge to utilize his or her discretion in fashioning an appropriate measure to address a testifying child witness's emotional or psychological stress, there was no rational reason why the court's exercise of sensitivity should not be extended to allow the use of a comfort dog where it was shown that such animal could ameliorate the stress of the testifying child witness. While subdivision (4) does not provide any criterion for a finding of necessity, the testimony of the social worker who had been working with the victim provided ample evidence that the dog's presence alleviated the victim's anxiety and allowed her to more easily discuss the conduct which was perpetrated against her. Furthermore, the court's decision to allow the dog at the witness stand during the victim's testimony was also a proper exercise of its inherent power and discretion to control the trial proceedings. Defendant made no showing that the dog's presence had any identifiable impact on the proceedings and the court specifically informed the jury that it was not to draw any inference in favor of or against either side because of the dog's presence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Presence of Therapeutic Comfort Dog during Testimony of Child Witness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution arising from allegations that defendant engaged in multiple acts of sexual misconduct against his minor daughter, her accompaniment by a therapeutic comfort dog to the witness stand did not violate defend ant's due process right to a fair trial. Defendant, who admitted that the dog was trained merely to respond to a person's stress level, offered no support for his contention that the dog's presence was inherently prejudicial because the dog allegedly conveyed the impression that the victim was being truthful as she testified. It is beyond dispute that a dog does not have the ability to discern truth from falsehood and thus cannot communicate such a distinction to a jury. Moreover, it could not be concluded that any actual prejudice resulted from the concededly unobtrusive presence of the dog in the courtroom. While the dog may have engendered some sympathy for the victim, there was no proof that such sympathy was significantly greater than the normal human response to a child's testimony about his or her sexual abuse at the hand of an adult. Furthermore, the court gave the jury specific instructions that it was not to permit sympathy to enter into its considerations, which instructions the jury was presumed to follow, and defense counsel did not suggest any further instruction regarding the dog's presence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right of Confrontation -- Presence of Therapeutic Comfort Dog during Testimony of Child Witness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a prosecution arising from allegations that defendant engaged in multiple acts of sexual misconduct against his minor daughter, her accompaniment by a therapeutic comfort dog to the witness stand did not violate defendant's constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. Defendant made no complaint or objection during trial that the dog physically impeded the jury's ability to observe the victim as she testified, but instead agreed that the dog sat peacefully and quietly on the stand. Nor did the dog's presence make it more likely that the jury would credit the victim's testimony as truthful. Defense counsel engaged in extended and thorough cross-examination of the victim and his right to cross-examine the central witness in the People's case against defendant was thus not impeded. There was also no indication that the jury deemed the dog's presence to be, in effect, a corroboration of the victim's testimony. Furthermore, the court specifically informed the jury that it was not to draw any inference in favor of or against either side because of the dog's presence and it must be presumed that the jury followed the legal instructions it was given.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Evidence -- Rape Shield Law </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a prosecution arising from allegations that defendant engaged in multiple acts of sexual misconduct against his minor daughter, County Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion under the Rape Shield Law (CPL 60.42) in precluding evidence concerning the victim's sexual history. Defendant's offer of proof that his daughter became pregnant by another man consisted of the fact that this man had lived next door to her, possibly at the time of conception, that the daughter had been seen texting people, and that, at an uncertain time, she had made a drawing with a picture of a heart, a baby, and the other man's name. The defendant's offer of proof was based on pure speculation and, therefore, was insufficient to overcome the presumption that such evidence should be precluded pursuant to the Rape Shield Law. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a reorganization meeting, officers of the committee were elected.

The petition was dismissed, and this appeal followed. On review, it was determined that the first cause of action was time barred insofar as it sought relief under CPLR art. 78 since the proceeding was commenced more than 4 months after the redistricting plan was enacted. The first cause of action was timely to the extent that it sought review under the Election Law. The State Democratic Committee, the County Board of Elections, and the elected district committee members were not necessary parties. However, the Election Law could not have been used to advance an otherwise time-barred CPLR art. 78 claim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, licensed owners and trainers of harness racehorses and a nonprofit organization of licensed owners, trainers and drivers of harness racehorses, filed an application in the Supreme Court, Schenectady County (New York), in a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78, to annul a certain regulation promulgated by respondent, the New York State Racing and Wagering Board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York State Racing and Wagering Board, pursuant to Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law &sect; 301, adopted regulations, 9 NYCRR 4043.12 and 4120.17, prohibiting the use of certain performance enhancing substances in racehorses and permitting the Board to drug test all racehorses under the care or control of a Board licensed trainer anticipated to compete in a race at a New York racetrack within six months. On appeal, the court found that, under former Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law &sect; 101, as well as the Board's broad power to regulate the harness racing industry, and the State of New York's interest in assuring the integrity of racing, the Board did not exceed its statutory authority when it adopted the regulations. Further, 9 NYCRR 4120.17(i), the penalty provision, was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable and the list of prohibited substances in 9 NYCRR 4120.17(e) was not so vague as to require annulment. However, 9 NYCRR 4120.17(e)(3), the portion of the regulation prohibiting all protein and peptide-based drugs, was properly annulled because it was inconsistent with, and could not be reconciled with 9 NYCRR 4120.2, the permitted-use regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Supreme Court, Bronx County (New York) that adjudicated him a level three sexually violent offender pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), Correction Law art. 6-C.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that SORA, which was not punitive in nature, did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10(1). Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in adjudicating him a level three offender. The appellate court disagreed. Although the court should not have assessed 30 of the 170 points and defendant should have been scored 140, he was still correctly designated a level three sex offender. The court opted to rely on the risk assessment instrument (RAI) only as a starting point and only after hearing oral argument from defendant at a separate hearing regarding the reliability of risk assessment tools. Defendant was given ample opportunity to argue his case, and the court reviewed his extensive submissions. Regarding drug abuse, in addition to the case summary, a 2001 inmate status report confirmed that defendant admitted to abusing LSD and alcohol in the past; that amounted to clear and convincing evidence of his drug use. The select disciplinary records on which defendant relied did not conclusively establish that he was no longer abusing drugs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Under the intents-effects test, amendments made to the Sex Offender Registration Act (Correction Law art 6-C [SORA]) since 1996 did not render the Act a punitive statute such that its retroactive application violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. The legislature intended the statute to be regulatory, and SORA is not now so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate the State's intention to deem it civil. Instead of imposing punishment for a past crime, the Act is a remedial statute intended to prevent future crime. The effect of the amendments--which included lengthening the registration period, creation of additional categories of offenders, adjusting the petition for relief, a photographic requirement, Internet availability of registrants, changing the role of the People and sentencing court in proceedings under the Act, and changing the penalties for failure to report--were aimed at improving the strength, efficiency and effectiveness of the Act as a civil statute, not at punishing sex offenders. Accordingly, the effect of the amendments was not so punitive as to negate the legislative intent. Although subjecting sex offenders to lifetime registration and notification requirements, with their attendant obligations and restrictions, increases the difficulties and embarrassment a sex offender may endure, even where he has led a law-abiding life since his conviction, the fact that the restrictions are difficult and cumbersome is not enough to make them unconstitutional.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The Sex Offender Registration Act (Correction Law art 6-C), as amended since 1996, is not penal in nature and does not violate constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Sex Offender Registration Act -- Risk Level Adjudication </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action challenging defendant's adjudication as a level three sex offender, the court sufficiently weighed the risk assessment instrument against the defense evidence and arguments, and correctly adjudicated defendant a level three offender. Defendant was given ample opportunity to argue his case at two separate hearings, and the court reviewed his extensive submissions. The People met their burden of establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, risk factors bearing a total score of 140 points, which supported a level three adjudication. While it was error to have assessed 20 points for the age of the victim, as there was a lack of clear and convincing evidence to support her age, and 10 points were doubly counted, defendant was initially assessed with 170 points, thereby still rendering him a level three offender. Moreover, defendant's admission of past drug use justified assessing points for that category. </SPAN></P>

XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee alleged that the detective failed to properly investigate the crime and disclose exculpatory evidence to him, the prosecutor, and the grand jury that indicted him. The trial court found probable cause for the arrest and prosecution based upon the identification of the arrestee by two witnesses, and that his assertion that disclosure of the exculpatory evidence to the grand jury would have materially influenced its investigation was speculative. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the arrestee failed to rebut the presumption of probable cause that was created by the grand jury's indictment. He also failed to raise triable issues of fact as to whether the prosecution was motivated by actual malice. His arrest, detention, and prosecution did not rise to the level of extreme or outrageous conduct necessary to sustain the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Finally, the arrestee failed to show a violation of &sect; 1983 or amend. XIV. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sculptor appealed a judgment by the New York County Supreme Court (New York) that denied his CPLR art. 78 petition to annul a decision by respondent city environmental control board that upheld a fine and the impoundment of his vehicle after he violated Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect; 16-118(7)(f)(1)(i); the sculptor claimed that the penalty was excessive and violated the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sculptor removed a single television antenna from the top of some curbside garbage bags, placed it in his vehicle, and drove away. The sculptor believed that the antenna was garbage and intended to use it in his artwork. Shortly thereafter, a city sanitation police officer pulled the sculptor over, and issued him a summons for unauthorized removal of residential recyclable material using a motor vehicle. The summons carried with it a mandatory $2,000 fine for a first offense. The officer also impounded the sculptor's vehicle, which was not to be released until the fine and applicable storage fees were paid. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the legislative history of the statute made clear that the $2,000 fine was established to serve as a deterrent and was not remedial. Therefore, as the imposition of the $2,000 fine was grossly disproportional to the offense charged, it amounted to an excessive fine under amend. VIII and &sect; 5. Accordingly, the sculptor was entitled to art. 78 relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified to grant the petition to the extent of vacating the fine; and, as so modified, the judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Forfeitures and Penalties -- Unenforceable Penalty -- Excessive Fine -- Unlawfully Removing Recyclable Object from Trash Pile</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The mandatory $2,000 fine imposed upon petitioner pursuant to Administrative Code of the City of New York &sect;16-118 (7) (f) (1) (i) for his first offense of unlawful removal of a single television antenna from the top of some curbside garbage bags and placing the antenna in his vehicle and driving away, in violation of section 16-118 (7) (b) (1), was vacated as grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense. Both the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution and article I, &sect; 5 of the NY Constitution prohibit &quot;excessive fines.&quot; To be constitutional, the amount of the fine must bear some relationship to the gravity of the offense that it is designed to punish. Therefore, a court should consider the seriousness of the offense, the severity of the harm caused, the potential harm had the defendant not been apprehended, the maximum fine to which the defendant could have been subject, and the defendant's economic circumstances. Here, the seriousness of the offense was relatively minor, as it involved taking a single piece of metal, abandoned by its owner, which likely had little value to the City. There was no significant harm caused by petitioner's conduct, and no potential harm to the owner of the antenna, or anyone else in the area, had petitioner not been caught. Moreover, because the statute contained no discretion and mandated a $2,000 fine in all circumstances, petitioner was essentially subject to the maximum punishment for the offense, even though he took a minimal amount of material, and was neither a commercial dealer nor someone taking items in bulk, parties whom the statute was intended to deter. Finally, the record established that petitioner had limited financial resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Cruel and Unusual Punishment -- Applicability of Constitutional Prohibitions against Excessive Fines to Civil Penalty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The constitutional prohibitions against excessive fines (US Const, 8th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 5) apply to a civil penalty imposed for the unlawful removal of a single television antenna from the top of some curbside garbage bags and placing the antenna in a vehicle and driving away, in violation of Administrative Code of the City of NY &sect; 16-118 (7) (b) (1). The relevant inquiry is not whether the fine arose in the civil or criminal context, but whether the fine constituted punishment. Where a civil fine serves, at least in part, deterrent and retributive purposes, it is considered punitive and subject to the prohibitions against excessive fines. The requirement that a mandatory $2,000 fine be levied for a violation of section 16-118 (7) (b) (1) could not fairly be viewed as solely remedial. The sizeable sanction is assessed regardless of the amount or value of the recyclable materials taken and bears no relationship to the actual loss sustained by the City of New York as a result of the violation. Moreover, the legislative history of the statute made clear that the fine was established to serve as a deterrent. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a Family Ct Act art. 10-A matter, appellant father appealed a judgment entered by the Family Court, St. Lawrence County, New York, which granted respondent child services agency's (CSA) motion to be relieved of its obligation to make further efforts to return the child to his father's care under Family Ct Act &sect; 1039-b(b)(6) because the father's parental rights had been involuntarily terminated with regard to two of the child's half siblings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that while the neglect petition was filed only against the mother, &sect; 1039-b was not limited to the respondent named in the neglect petition. The father was on notice of the neglect case and participated in it. He was advised of his right to address custody issues and that a termination of parental rights petition could be brought against him regardless of whether he was a named respondent under Family Ct Act &sect; 1035(d). The statute and its underlying justification supported the CSA's authority to make the motion. Section 1039-b(b)(6) did not unconstitutionally distinguish between individuals whose parental rights were involuntarily terminated and those who rights were voluntarily surrendered. An involuntary termination led to an adoption that relieved the biological parent of all parental duties and responsibilities for the child. A voluntary surrender might involve ongoing contacts between the biological parent and child. Section 1039-b(b)(6) was properly limited to individuals whose rights to further contact with their other children had been terminated. Section 1039-b's procedures did not offend due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner business brought a CPLR art. 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action against respondent town, seeking to annul a determination of a zoning board of appeals (ZBA) and a declaration that a designation on a zoning map was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), denied the landscaper's summary judgment motion, and granted the town's cross-motion for, inter alia, summary judgment. The business appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business asserted that the town was estopped from prohibiting it from conducting grinding and mulching operations on the subject parcels. The appellate court found, however, that estoppel could not have been invoked against a municipality to either (1) prevent it from discharging its statutory duties, (2) ratify administrative errors, or (3) preclude it from enforcing its zoning laws. The conduct alleged did not rise to the level of fraud, misrepresentation, or deception. The estoppel claim was properly rejected. Even if the ZBA violated the Open Meetings Law, Public Officers Law art 7, pursuant to Public Officers Law &sect; 107(1), its actions with respect to the appeals were not void but, rather, voidable upon good cause shown. In light of the substantial public input at a prior hearing and the parties' extensive documentary submissions, the business failed to establish good cause to invalidate the ZBA's determination. The ZBA's interpretation of a designation on the town's zoning map was not irrational or unconstitutionally vague. The ZBA rationally and properly found that the mulching operation was not a permitted use on the parcel lying within the zone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), convicted defendant of identity theft in the second degree, Penal Law &sect; 190.79(3) (2 counts), criminal impersonation in the second degree (14 counts), forgery in the third degree (10 counts), aggravated harassment in the second degree (3 counts), and unauthorized use of a computer. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions arose out of defendant's use of emails to impersonate actual persons. Defendant was the son of an expert on the Dead Sea Scrolls, and set up email accounts in which he pretended to be other scholars who disagreed with the father's opinion on the Scrolls. Among other things, defendant sent emails in which one of his father's rivals purportedly admitted to acts of plagiarism. The appellate court found that the evidence established that defendant never intended any kind of parody and that defendant intended harm that fell within the plain meaning of the term &quot;injure.&quot; This was not protected by the First Amendment. Defendant also intended to create specific benefits for his father's career. However, the theory of the identity theft conviction under the first count was that in the commission of second degree identity theft, defendant attempted to commit the felony of scheme to defraud in the first degree, Penal Law &sect; 190.65(1)(b). However, there was no evidence that defendant intended to defraud one or more persons of property in excess of $ 1,000 or that he attempted to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified to the extent of vacating the identity theft conviction under the first count of the indictment and dismissing that count.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction resulted from an alleged home invasion. Defendant did not deny being present at the scene, but contended that he merely gave a friend a ride as a favor and waited outside the home while the friend had a conversation with the victim's wife. Defendant testified that he only became involved after the friend and the victim's wife started pushing each other and the victim charged the friend with a billy club. The victim and his wife testified that, upon arriving at their rural, secluded home, the friend and defendant immediately attacked them, restrained them with duct tape, ransacked parts of their house, and stole money they kept in their freezer. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the inconsistencies in the descriptions of the events were fully explored at trial. In any event, defendant admitted that he twice struck the victim in the head with the billy club. Because defendant argued that he was justified in doing so because the victim attacked him with it first, the trial court duly instructed the jury on the justification defense. Consequently there was no basis to disturb the verdict as against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment to the local law expanded the definition of &quot;nursing home&quot; to include an assisted living facility and/or memory care facility, thereby enabling the owners' competitors to build a second assisted living or memory care facility within a planned unit development (PUD). The appellate court found, inter alia, that, notwithstanding the proximity of the owners' property and assisted care facility to the site affected by the amendment, the economic harm they alleged was insufficient to confer standing on them. The amendment did not constitute illegal spot zoning. Although the amendment might have benefitted the competitors, it was enacted for the general welfare of the community. Moreover, it did not effect a regulatory taking of the owners' property without just compensation. Rather, the amendment served a legitimate governmental interest in expanding affordable housing options for seniors in the area, in addition to increasing the tax base and creating jobs. Finally, there was no evidence that the change brought about by the amendment interfered in any way with the returns on the owners' investments. Thus, they were not entitled to art. 78 relief or a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment entered by the Monroe County Court, New York, which convicted him of burglary in the second degree under Penal Law &sect; 140.25(2) and sentenced him as a persistent felony offender to an indeterminate term of incarceration of 20 years to life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that defendant did not preserve his claim relating to the trial court's response to a jury note and direction that the court reporter read back certain testimony. Defendant's claim of error in admitting the grand jury testimony of a witness after conducting a Sirois hearing was rejected. Defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of New York's discretionary persistent felony offender sentencing statute was unpreserved and meritless. While the court did not err in sentencing defendant as a persistent felony offender, the sentence was unduly harsh as although a burglary offense under &sect; 140.25(2) was a violent felony offense under Penal Law &sect; 70.02(1)(b), defendant did not employ actual violence in the offense, even though he was confronted by the resident. With the possible exception of two misdemeanor convictions of resisting arrest and criminal possession of a weapon in the 1980's, and a 2001 burglary conviction, defendant never used or threatened violence in the commission of a crime. The sentence was reduced to an indeterminate term of incarceration of 15 years to life under CPL 470.20(6).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that on the absence of any proof that approval had been given, the commissioner lacked the capacity to maintain the present appeal on behalf of the Nassau County Board of Elections (NCBOE). The county could not claim that, by complying with ERMA, it would be forced to violate a constitutional prohibition, because it was the NCBOE -- not the county -- that was responsible for the implementation of the requirements of ERMA. Inasmuch as the county had neither alleged nor demonstrated that it played any role in implementing the statute it sought to challenge, it could not be said that the county itself would be forced to violate a constitutional proscription if obliged to comply with the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Court of Appeals decision in Roberts v. Tishman Speyer Props., L.P., 13 NY3d 270 (2009), the owner sought a declaration that it was no longer subject to the provisions of the J-51 program, including but not limited to any rent regulatory provisions contained therein. The owner claimed that it would not have applied for the benefits if, as a result of receiving the benefits, it would be precluded from exercising luxury decontrol. The appellate court found, inter alia, that there was no provision in the program for unilateral withdrawal from the program or for repaying the tax benefits in exchange for rescission from the program. The owner, under the guise of recission, was seeking a waiver of tax benefits, which was not permitted by 28 RCNY 5-03(f)(3)(ii). Any mistake as to the law by HPD regarding whether units could be decontrolled while receiving J-51 benefits was immaterial to its decision to accept the owner into the program. Accordingly, as the owner failed to state a cause of action under the Due Process and Takings Clauses of the United States Constitution, or pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, its art. 78 petition was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner/plaintiff landlord could not rescind its participation in the City of New York's J-51 tax incentive program following the Court of Appeals' decision that owners of rent-stabilized apartments in New York City would not be able to take advantage of the luxury decontrol provisions of the Rent Stabilization Law while simultaneously receiving tax incentive benefits under the J-51 program (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Roberts v Tishman Speyer Props., L.P.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 13 NY3d 270, 918 NE2d 900, 890 NYS2d 388 [2009]). There is no provision in the J-51 program for unilateral withdrawal from the program or for repaying the tax benefits in exchange for rescission from the program nunc pro tunc; rather, the rules of the City of New York provide that rent regulation requirements shall not be terminated by the waiver or revocation of tax benefits (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;28 RCNY 5-03 [f] [3] [ii]). Although the landlord contended that its participation in the program was the result of a mutual mistake in that it would never have opted to participate in the program had it known what the Court of Appeals would decide, and that therefore it was not seeking a waiver of previously accepted benefits but a finding that those benefits were void ab initio, the practical effect of the landlord's request would be a waiver which is not permitted. Further, the remedy of rescission was not available since the J-51 program is a tax benefit program--there was no contract or agreement to rescind (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;RPTL 489); moreover, there was no mutual mistake of fact.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner/plaintiff landlord could not rescind its participation in the City of New York's J-51 tax incentive program on the ground that its participation was based on a mutual mistake of the law on its part and on the part of the City's Department of Housing and Preservation and Development (HPD), which mistake was exposed by the Court of Appeals' decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Roberts v </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Tishman Speyer Props., L.P. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(13 NY3d 270, 918 NE2d 900, 890 NYS2d 388 [2009]), which held that the owners of rent-stabilized apartments in New York City were not entitled to take advantage of the luxury decontrol provisions of the Rent Stabilization Law while simultaneously receiving tax incentive benefits under the City of New York's J-51 program. Even though the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, and perhaps also HPD, were under the same mistaken interpretation of the law as was the landlord prior to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Roberts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision, that interpretation was entirely unrelated to HPD's confirmation of the landlord's eligibility for the J-51 program. Thus, any mistake as to the law by HPD regarding whether units could be decontrolled while receiving J-51 benefits was immaterial to its decision to accept the landlord into the program. Moreover, CPLR 3005 does not permit a misreading of the law by any party to cancel an agreement, nor was it a basis for granting the landlord the relief of rescission from the J-51 program.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding and action in which petitioner/plaintiff landlord sought to rescind its participation in the City of New York's J-51 tax incentive program following the Court of Appeals' decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Roberts v Tishman Speyer Props., L.P. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">(13 NY3d 270, 918 NE2d 900, 890 NYS2d 388 [2009]), which held that the owners of rent-stabilized apartments in New York City were not entitled to take advantage of the luxury decontrol provisions of the Rent Stabilization Law while simultaneously receiving tax incentive benefits under the City of New York's J-51 program, the landlord failed to state a cause of action under either the Due Process and Takings Clauses of the United States Constitution or pursuant to 42 USC &sect; 1983. While the landlord alleged that without rescission, it will have surrendered a valuable statutory right to receive luxury decontrol without having had an opportunity to know what the law was and to conform conduct accordingly, the decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Roberts</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> construed a statute and did not create a new legal principle; judicial construction of a statute which invalidates a regulation promulgated by an agency does not create a new legal principle. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York), of burglary in the second degree, criminally negligent homicide, criminal injection of a narcotic drug, criminal contempt in the first degree, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, after his motion to suppress statements to law enforcement officials and physical evidence was denied. He appealed his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered the burglary victim's home, contrary to a protection order, and injected the homicide victim with heroin, whom police falsely told him was alive but could die if he didn't state what drug he gave her. The appellate court held his responses were inadmissible because (1) a threat of a homicide charge elicited them, so (2) he did not voluntarily waive his self-incrimination privilege, denying due process, under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 and CPL 60.45(1) and (2)(a). His convictions for criminally negligent homicide, criminal injection of a narcotic drug, and possession of a controlled substance had to be vacated because only the improper statements supported them. Sufficient evidence supported criminal contempt because (1) he knew of the protection order, which existed when he entered the home, (2) the victim's consent was no defense, under Penal Law &sect; 140.00(5), and (3) he admitted a prior conviction. Insufficient evidence supported burglary because (1) he allegedly intended to commit criminal possession of drugs, (2) only his improper statement linked him to drugs in the home, (3) no drug possession was shown, and (4) no contemporaneous intent to possess was shown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was modified by vacating convictions of burglary in the second degree, criminally negligent homicide, criminal injection of a narcotic drug, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, and, as modified, the judgment was affirmed, and defendant's motion to suppress statements to police was granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Police Officer's Deception and Threatening of Defendant</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a prosecution for various crimes arising out of the death of a woman defendant was accused of injecting with heroin, the police, while interrogating defendant, exceeded permissible deception, such that defendant's statements to the police should have been suppressed because they were unconstitutionally coerced. When interrogating a suspect, the police may, as part of their investigatory efforts, deceive a suspect, and any resulting statement will not be suppressed for that reason alone; however, the deception used to obtain a statement must not be so fundamentally unfair as to deny due process. Here, the detectives questioning defendant not only repeatedly deceived defendant by telling him that the victim was alive, but implicitly threatened him with a homicide charge by telling defendant that the consequences of his remaining silent would lead to the victim's death, since the physicians would be unable to treat her, which &quot;could be a problem&quot; for him. While arguably subtle, the import of the detectives' threat to the defendant was clear: his silence would lead to the victim's death, and then he could be charged with her homicide. The detectives coerced defendant's confession by deceiving him into believing that the victim was alive and implicitly threatening him with a homicide charge. Faced with no acceptable option, defendant had no alternative but to talk to the police. By lying to defendant and threatening him, the detectives eviscerated any sense defendant may have had that he could safely exercise his privilege against self-incrimination and put the People to their proof. Therefore, defendant did not voluntarily waive his Fifth Amendment privilege as the detectives' threat overcame defendant's will and was so fundamentally unfair as to deny due process.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Criminal Contempt -- Violation of Order of Protection</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was legally sufficient to support defendant's conviction of criminal contempt in the first degree based on defendant's violation of an order of protection requiring him to stay away from his mother's home. The order of protection was issued against the defendant, who was present in court when it was issued and, thus, he had actual knowledge of the order. At trial, the defendant admitted to a special information which charged that he had been previously convicted of criminal contempt in the second degree. Although the trial testimony of defendant's mother indicated that she attempted to have the order of protection modified or vacated, it was indisputably in effect when defendant entered her home. Thus, the fact that defendant's mother may have permitted defendant to enter her home did not render the defendant's entry lawful (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 140.00 [5]). To find otherwise would subvert the very purpose of orders of protection, which is to protect victims of domestic violence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Burglary -- Unlawful Entry -- Violation of Order of Protection</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In a prosecution for burglary arising out of defendant's entry into his mother's home and committing certain crimes there, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there was legally sufficient evidence to establish that defendant entered his mother's home unlawfully where there was a valid temporary order of protection issued against defendant for the benefit of his mother, which order was indisputably in effect when defendant allegedly committed the underlying crimes, and of which defendant was unquestionably aware.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Burglary -- Intent to Commit Specific Crime</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a prosecution for burglary, the People generally do not need to prove that a defendant intended to commit a particular crime, but where the People expressly limit their theory of the defendant's guilt of burglary to the intent to commit a specific crime, they are bound to prove the defendant's intent to commit that particular crime. Accordingly, where the indictment, as amplified by the bill of particulars, expressly charged defendant, with respect to burglary, with the intent to commit the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, the People had the burden of proving that defendant, at the time he unlawfully entered his mother's home in violation of an order of protection, intended to commit that specific crime while inside.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Controlled Substances -- Possession of Heroin</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The evidence was legally insufficient to support defendant's conviction of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree arising out of the discovery of a bag containing a trace amount of heroin found in his bedroom in his mother's house. Although the trial evidence established defendant's regular use of that bedroom, and his close proximity thereto when he was taken into custody, no evidence was presented to establish that defendant possessed heroin on his person at the time of his arrest. Moreover, since defendant's mother's home had multiple bedrooms and occupants, any of whom could have easily accessed the defendant's bedroom, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it was legally insufficient to establish that defendant constructively possessed heroin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Burglary -- Intent to Commit Criminal Possession of Controlled Substance</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a prosecution for burglary in which the People alleged that defendant unlawfully entered his mother's home in violation of an order of protection with the intent to criminally possess heroin, even if the People had established defendant's constructive possession of heroin recovered from his bedroom, they nevertheless failed to present legally sufficient evidence establishing that defendant had intended to commit the offense of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree at the time he entered his mother's home. Since criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree is a &quot;continuing offense&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 10.00 [8]), viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the People could not establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the trace amount of heroin found in defendant's bedroom existed at the moment of the defendant's unlawful entry into his mother's home. The bag containing the heroin could have been there for days, or placed there immediately before or after defendant's entry. Therefore, the People did not establish that any intent on the defendant's part to commit the offense of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree was contemporaneous with his unlawful entry. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was shot in the abdomen by defendant shooter, who apparently misidentified him as a rival gang member. The plaintiffs alleged that the manufacturer and the distributor supplied handguns to the licensee even though they knew or should have known that he was distributing those guns to unlawful purchasers for trafficking into the criminal market. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the matter fell within the general definition of a &quot;qualified civil liability action&quot; in 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7903(5)(A). In addition, the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that defendants knowingly violated various federal and state statutes applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms within the meaning of the predicate exception in &sect; 7903(5)(A)(iii). Although the complaint did not specify the statutes allegedly violated, it sufficiently alleged facts supporting a finding that the defendants knowingly violated federal gun laws.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) (15 USC &sect; 7901 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) did not preclude an action to recover damages for injuries sustained when plaintiff student was shot by a gang member, inasmuch as plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that defendants, the manufacturer, distributor, and dealer of the subject gun, knowingly violated various federal and state statutes applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms within the meaning of the PLCAA's predicate exception (15 USC &sect; 7903 [5] [A] [iii]). While the PLCAA generally shields manufacturers and sellers of firearms from liability for harm caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of their non-defective products (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;15 USC &sect;&sect; 7901 [b] [1]; 7903 [5] [A]), a &quot;qualified civil liability action&quot; prohibited under the PLCAA does not include &quot;an action in which a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought&quot; (15 USC &sect; 7903 [5] [A] [iii]). Although the complaint did not specify the statutes allegedly violated, it sufficiently alleged facts supporting a finding that defendants knowingly violated federal gun laws. Plaintiffs alleged that, on at least four occasions, the dealer sold guns to a convicted felon who was prohibited from purchasing firearms (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">18 USC &sect; 922 [d] [1]), via illegal straw purchases, and that one of those straw purchases included the gun used to shoot plaintiff. With respect to the manufacturer and distributor, the complaint sufficiently alleged that they were accomplices to the dealer's statutory violations in that they supplied guns to the dealer even though they knew or should have known that he was distributing those guns to unlawful purchasers for trafficking in the criminal market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Jurisdiction -- Long-Arm Jurisdiction -- Discovery</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action seeking damages for injuries sustained in a shooting, in which plaintiffs alleged that defendant firearms dealer unlawfully sold the subject gun in Ohio to a New York resident via a straw purchase and that the gun was later used to shoot and injure plaintiff in New York, the court erred in dismissing the action against the dealer for lack of personal jurisdiction. The complaint sufficiently alleged under CPLR 302 (a) (3) that defendant committed a tortious act outside New York that caused injury to a person inside New York and expected or reasonably should have expected that his sale of guns to a gun trafficking ring would have consequences in New York; plaintiffs were otherwise entitled to discovery on that issue. In opposing a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (8) on the ground that discovery on the issue of personal jurisdiction is necessary, plaintiffs need not make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction, but instead must only set forth a &quot;sufficient start,&quot; and show their position not to be frivolous. Although plaintiffs' allegations that the dealer garnered significant revenue from gun sales to a New York resident did not establish that he &quot;derive[d] substantial revenue from goods used or consumed&quot; in New York (CPLR 302 [a] [3] [i]), plaintiffs made the requisite sufficient start by alleging that the purchaser operated a gun trafficking ring in New York, and that the dealer supplied over 140 guns to the purchaser and his associates, including the gun used to shoot plaintiff, within a period of months. Thus, plaintiffs were entitled to discovery to determine how many of the guns the dealer sold to the purchaser were trafficked into New York and whether that amount was sufficient to conclude that the dealer derived substantial revenue from guns used or consumed in New York. Further, jurisdictional discovery was necessary to determine the nature of the dealer's relationship with defendant distributor. If the distributor and dealer were a single enterprise or shared an agency relationship, as plaintiffs alleged, then the admittedly interstate character of the distributor could render the dealer amenable to jurisdiction in New York.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporations brought a combined proceeding pursuant to CPLR art. 78 and action for declaratory judgment, to, among other things, review a policy of respondent wagering board with regard to the granting of certain secondary pari-mutuel operator approvals.

The appellate court found that the board's change in policy occurred in January 2008 and the record demonstrated that the corporations participated in a conference call with the board's counsel at the end of that month during which they were informed of the change and that agreements with out-of-state SPMOs had been approved without the resident restriction. As the gravamen of the corporations' claim was that the policy change put them at a competitive disadvantage, an actual and concrete injury occurred, if at all, in January 2008. Further administrative action as of that time would have been unavailing in light of the fact that certain agreements had already been approved.

The town and the LLCs had no pending applications for a permit under the regulations, but claimed that their properties would have been affected by the amended regulations or that they could have been compelled to comply with them. The appellate court found, however, unlike owners affected by a zoning reclassification, these allegations were potential, speculative harm that was insufficient to confer standing. Nor could the LLCs have claimed standing pursuant to State Finance Law &sect; 123-b. The LLCs did not identify any expenditure by the state that they sought to challenge, and the claims raised in their petition did not have a sufficient nexus to fiscal activities so as to allow for &sect; 123-b standing. The LLCs did not qualify for common-law taxpayer standing either, as property owners subjected to the requirements of the regulations would have been able to challenge them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, builders and builders associations, sued defendant state officials challenging the 2008 amendments to the Wicks Law, claiming the amendments violated the New York State and Federal Constitutions, and seeking, inter alia, judgment declaring the 2008 amendments to be unconstitutional and enjoining their enforcement. The Erie County, New York Supreme Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendments increased and created a three-tiered monetary threshold and provided a means for governmental entities to opt out of wicks law separate bidding requirements. Inter alia, the appellate court held that the Legislature acted within its province in determining, as a matter of statewide concern, that it was necessary to provide relief to all counties by easing the burdens of Wicks Law compliance. As to the three-tiered classification, nothing in the N.Y. Const. art. IX home rule provisions required classifications that would extend the benefits of the 2008 amendments equally. All that was required was that the classification be defined by conditions common to the class and related to the subject of the statute. Neither the wisdom behind the creation of the classification nor specific monetary thresholds was an appropriate subject of judicial fact-finding. Since plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, however, the proper course was not to dismiss the complaint but rather to issue a judgment in favor of defendants declaring that the 2008 amendments to the Wicks Law, to the extent they were challenged by plaintiffs, were valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff County of Erie had standing to challenge the 2008 amendments to the Wicks Law (L 2008, ch 57, part MM), insofar as they established a three-tiered monetary threshold for the cost of public construction projects subject to the Wicks Law's separate bidding requirements which took into consideration geographically-based differences in the costs of construction, as an allegedly unconstitutional impairment of its home rule powers protected under article IX of the New York State Constitution. The general rule that a local government may not challenge the constitutionality of an act of the legislature affecting its powers was not applicable. Undiscriminating application of the general rule would undermine the home rule protection afforded local governments in article IX of the Constitution by subverting the very purpose of giving the local governments powers which the legislature is forbidden by the Constitution to impair or annul except as provided in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Home Rule Powers -- Special Law Serving Substantial State Concern -- Monetary Thresholds for Public Construction Projects Subject to Wicks Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The 2008 amendments to the Wicks Law (L 2008, ch 57, part MM), insofar as they established a three-tiered monetary threshold for the cost of public construction projects subject to the Wicks Law's separate bidding requirements which took into consideration geographically-based differences in the costs of construction, were valid and constitutional under the home rule provisions of article IX of the New York State Constitution, notwithstanding that the monetary threshold constituted a special law and the enactment of the 2008 amendments was unaccompanied by a home rule message. Although the 2008 amendments constitute a special law inasmuch as the new monetary thresholds apply differently &quot;in terms and in effect&quot; to the counties classified within each tier (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 3 [d] [4]), the procedural requirement of a home rule message (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NY Const, art IX, &sect; 2 [b]) was not triggered because the subject matter of the amendments bears a direct and reasonable relationship to the substantial state concern underlying the Wicks Law, i.e., &quot;assur[ing] the prudent and economical use of public moneys for the benefit of all the inhabitants of the state and . . . facilitat[ing] the acquisition of facilities and commodities of maximum quality at the lowest possible cost&quot; (General Municipal Law &sect; 100-a). Thus, the legislature acted by virtue of the powers reserved to it under article IX of the Constitution in enacting the amendments without a home rule message. The classification created by the 2008 amendments, distinguishing between the counties comprising New York City, its immediate suburbs, and the remainder of the State, is reasonable and related to the purpose of the amendments, which was to ease the burden that the Wicks Law imposes on local governments by eliminating smaller projects from the Wicks Law mandates. The requirement that the classification be defined by conditions common to the class and related to the subject of the statute was met, and neither the wisdom behind the creation of the classification nor the amount of the specific monetary thresholds chosen by the legislature was an appropriate subject of judicial fact-finding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Contracts -- Public Works Contracts -- Project Labor Agreements -- Apprenticeship Training Program Requirement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The apprenticeship training program requirement of Labor Law &sect;222 (2) (e), which states that, &quot;[w]ith respect to any contract for construction&quot; meeting the Wicks Law monetary thresholds, the contracting governmental entity &quot;shall . . . require that each contractor and subcontractor shall participate in apprentice training programs . . . that have been approved by the [D]epartment [of Labor],&quot; does not apply to all contracts subject to the Wicks Law, but applies only to those contracts where the government entity has elected to utilize a project labor agreement (PLA) and thereby to opt out of the separate bidding mandate of the Wicks Law. Labor Law &sect; 222, an integral part of the comprehensive Wicks Law reforms enacted in 2008, provides a means for governmental entities to opt out of the Wicks Law's separate bidding requirements altogether provided that there is a PLA complying with the terms of that section in place (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Labor Law &sect; 222 [2] [b]). While Labor Law &sect; 222 (2) (e) states that it applies to &quot;any contract for construction,&quot; the quoted language does not refer to any contract subject to the Wicks Law but, rather, it refers to any contract subject to a PLA. That interpretation follows from the language of subdivision (2) (e), which refers to &quot;[a]ny contract . . . with respect to each project undertaken pursuant to this section,&quot; i.e., pursuant to Labor Law &sect; 222, &quot;Project labor agreements.&quot; The heading of Labor Law &sect; 222 resolves the ambiguity created by the language &quot;any contract&quot; used therein.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Administrative Interpretation -- Project Labor Agreements -- Apprenticeship Training Program Requirement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The apprenticeship training program requirement of Labor Law &sect; 222 (2) (e), which applies to contracts where the governmental entity has elected to utilize a project labor agreement (PLA) and thereby to opt out of the separate bidding mandate of the Wicks Law, does not require a contractor or subcontractor to maintain an apprenticeship training program of its own. The Department of Labor, which is charged with the enforcement of the Wicks Law, including the PLA provisions enacted in 2008 (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Labor Law &sect;&sect; 2 [2]; 224 [1]), has concluded that, if a contractor or subcontractor enters into a PLA that meets the requirements of Labor Law &sect; 222, those contractors and subcontractors who perform work under the PLA are deemed to be participating in apprenticeship programs within the meaning of that section. That interpretation, viewed in the light of the language and purpose of the statute, is reasonable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Taxpayer's Action Challenging Wicks Law Amendments</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Plaintiffs did not have standing to bring a citizen taxpayer cause of action alleging that the 2008 amendments to the Wicks Law (L 2008, ch 57, part MM) waste taxpayer funds by excluding out-of-state contractors and minority-owned and women-owned businesses from qualifying to obtain work on public construction projects, and by inflating the cost of those projects. Plaintiffs' allegations amounted to no more than a claim that state funds were not being spent wisely, which was patently insufficient to satisfy the minimum threshold for standing under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b (1). Moreover, plaintiffs failed to allege some specific threat of an imminent expenditure, and thus lacked standing to bring a citizen taxpayer action on that ground as well.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Wicks Law Amendments</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. With regard to causes of action alleging that the 2008 amendments to the Wicks Law (L 2008, ch 57, part MM) violate the State and Federal guarantees of equal protection of the laws, insofar as they established a three-tiered monetary threshold for the cost of public construction projects subject to the Wicks Law's separate bidding requirements which took into consideration geographically-based differences in the costs of construction, plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to meet their burden to negate every conceivable basis which might support the 2008 amendments, whether or not the basis had a foundation in the record. Since the 2008 amendments neither interfered with the exercise of a fundamental right nor involved a suspect class, review was governed by the rational basis standard. The three-tiered monetary threshold met the more exacting standard of the home rule provisions of article IX of the New York State Constitution in that it bears a reasonable relationship to an accompanying substantial state concern. Further, plaintiffs failed to establish that those sections of the Labor Law sanctioning the use of project labor agreements unconstitutionally favor union contractors over nonunion contractors. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment charging him with vehicular manslaughter and driving while intoxicated alleging that Penal Law &sect; 125.12 was unconstitutionally vague was denied by the County Court of Chemung County (New York). Defendant waived his right to a jury trial, and agreed to a bench trial conducted on stipulated facts. He was convicted and sentenced to five years of probation, with six months to be served in the county jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed. The appellate court held that the rebuttable presumption of &sect; 125.12 did not render &sect; 125.12 vague as it contained sufficient standards to afford a reasonable degree of certainty so that a person of ordinary intelligence was not forced to guess at its meaning, and to safeguard against arbitrary enforcement. The New York legislature had found that there was a rational connection between the fact that a defendant caused death or serious physical injury by operating a vehicle while impaired by alcohol and the presumption that it was the alcohol impairment that caused the defendant to operate the vehicle dangerously. Defendant stipulated that he operated a vehicle while unlawfully intoxicated, that the victim fell out of the vehicle as defendant corrected a deviation from the vehicle's course, that the victim died due to injuries sustained in the fall, and that defendant caused the victim's death while unlawfully intoxicated. However, the trial court erred by treating the statutory presumption as mandatory, rather than permissive, and did not determine whether defendant operated the vehicle so as to cause the victim's death and did so due to unlawful intoxication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified, by reversing defendant's conviction of vehicular manslaughter.

A reimbursement request was denied as untimely under Workers' Compensation Law &sect;&sect; 15(8)(h)(2) and 2(19), (20).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer requested reimbursement from the SDF for benefits paid to three claimants who were injured prior to 1994. The Workers' Compensation Board previously determined that the employer was entitled to reimbursement, and it was paid numerous times for benefits paid to those claimants. However, the particular requests were rejected as untimely by the Committee, based on a &sect;&sect; 15(8)(h)(2) and 2(19), (20). Thereafter, the employer brought an action, asserting claims of actual and constructive trust, conversion, and unjust enrichment, and seeking various relief and a declaration that &sect; 15(8)(h)(2)(B) was unconstitutional. The trial court granted defendants' dismissal motion. On appeal, the court agreed, noting that there was no constitutionally protected property interest in the assessments or in the SDF. There was no statutory language that created private rights of a contractual nature that were enforceable against the State. Further, the employer received constitutionally adequate process with respect to receipt of the benefits. Lastly, a takings claim failed, as it was the employer's own failure to file on time that caused the reimbursement right to become extinguished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent State brought a Mental Hygiene Law art. 10 proceeding for the civil management of appellant patient, a sex offender allegedly suffering from a mental abnormality and requiring civil management. The Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York), among other things, granted the petition and directed that the patient be subject to a regimen of strict and intensive supervision and treatment. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued that the term &quot;mental abnormality&quot; as defined in Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.03(i) was unconstitutionally vague both on its face and as applied to him. However, the appellate court found that the terms &quot;condition,&quot; &quot;disease,&quot; and &quot;disorder&quot; in &sect; 10.03(i) were sufficiently definite to give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to make the determination. The State's expert psychiatrist concluded that the patient suffered from paraphilia NOS, a disorder of sexual arousal, based upon hebephilia, an attraction to post-pubescent teenage boys, which predisposed him to committing sexual offenses, and that the patient had serious difficulty controlling his conduct. The State's expert explained that while hebephilia was not a specifically defined subcategory of paraphilia listed in the DSM-IV, paraphilia NOS, which was a specifically defined subcategory of paraphilia, encompassed hebephilia. Under the circumstances of this case, the term &quot;mental abnormality&quot; as defined in &sect; 10.03(i) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied. Thus, since there existed at least one constitutional application of the statute, it was not invalid on its face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) ruled that petitioner, a school district, violated Civil Service Law &sect; 209-a (1)(d) by failing to negotiate the discontinuance of reimbursement of Medicare Part B premiums. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court rejected petitioner's assertion that reimbursement of Medicare Part B premiums was not a &quot;term and condition of employment&quot; subject to mandatory negotiation. Petitioner had a duty to negotiate with the bargaining representative of current employees regarding any change in a past practice affecting their own retirement health benefits. On its past practice determination, PERB found a reasonable expectation by unit employees that they would receive reimbursement of Medicare Part B premiums upon their retirement. This finding was supported by the stipulated facts that petitioner reimbursed Medicare Part B premiums to active employees and retirees since at least 1980 and that, despite the fact that the health insurance coverage provided under the collective bargaining agreements subsequent to 1990 did not require such reimbursement, petitioner continued to do so until July 2003. Furthermore, numerous witnesses testified that they were made aware of petitioner's practice prior to the June 2003 announcement. PERB's conclusion that the employee union did not waive its right to negotiate was rational and supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), dismissed an application brought by petitioner limited liability company (LLC) which, in a combined proceeding pursuant to CPLR art. 78 and action for declaratory judgment, sought review of a determination of respondent Department of Economic Development (DED) revoking the LLC's certification as an empire zone business enterprise pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 959. The LLC appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LLC argued that the DED should have taken into account the investment it made in May 2000 when it bought a building in a city empire zone, when it was a participant in the Empire Zones Development Program (EZDP), which was the predecessor to the Empire Zones Program (EZP). However, the appellate court held that the April 2009 amendments to the Empire Zones Act, General Municipal Law &sect; 955 et seq., did not require that the DED examine every business annual report (BAR) filed by an entity, whether for the EZP or the EZDP. Instead, the amendments required only that the review include at least three BARs and, as such, implicitly authorized a limited review of the BARs filed by a program participant. &sect; 959(a)(v)(6), (w). Since 2001 was the first tax year to occur after the EZP came into existence, it represented a logical starting point to review an entity's performance, and the determination not to include the LLC's 2000 BAR was not arbitrary or capricious. However, making the decertification retroactive to 2008 and, as a result, depriving the LLC of tax benefits and credits earned during the 2008 tax year, constituted an unlawful taking of its property without due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified by reversing so much thereof as dismissed that part of the petition/complaint seeking a declaration that the April 2009 amendments to General Municipal Law &sect; 959 may not have been applied retroactively to January 1, 2008. The petition/complaint was granted to that extent and it was declared that said amendments shall be applied prospectively. As so modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In reviewing petitioner's business annual reports (BARs) to determine if petitioner met the &quot;1:1 benefit-cost test&quot; (General Municipal Law &sect;959 [a] [v] [6]) required to remain eligible for tax benefits as a participant in the Empire Zones Program (EZP), the Department of Economic Development's (DED) decision to limit its review to the 2001-2007 time period (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;5 NYCRR 11.9 [c] [2]) and to exclude petitioner's 2000 BAR filed with the predecessor Economic Development Zones Program (EDZP) was not arbitrary, capricious, or an unlawful exercise of its regulatory authority. The 2009 amendments to the Empire Zones Act do not require that the DED examine every BAR filed by a participating business enterprise, whether for the EZP or its predecessor, the EDZP. The amendments require only that the review include at least three BARs and, as such, implicitly authorize a limited review of the BARs filed by a program participant (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;General Municipal Law &sect;959 [a] [v] [6]; [w]). Moreover, since 2001 is the first tax year to occur after the EZP came into existence, it represents a logical starting point to review a business enterprise's performance while participating in that program. Furthermore, DED uniformly applied the 2001-2007 time frame to more than 8,000 companies, including those, like petitioner, that had been certified prior to 2001 as participants in the EDZP.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Exemptions -- Decertification of Empire Zone Business Enterprise -- Statutory Procedures -- Notice</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Petitioner was provided adequate notice of the Commissioner of Economic Development's determination to revoke its certification as a participating business enterprise in the Empire Zones Program (EZP), as well as the reasons for its decertification, as required by General Municipal Law &sect;959 (w). By letter, the Commissioner informed petitioner that an examination of its business records had been conducted pursuant to the 2009 amendments to the Empire Zones Act. One month later, in another letter, the Commissioner informed petitioner that its certification was being revoked because it failed to meet the requirements of the &quot;1:1 benefit-cost test&quot; (General Municipal Law &sect;959 [a] [v] [6]), and that petitioner had the right to appeal its decertification in writing to the Empire Zone Designation Board (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;5 NYCRR 14.2 [a], [b]). In addition, petitioner was on notice that its decertification review would be based on at least three business annual reports that it had filed with the EZP and that the Department of Economic Development had recently promulgated regulations limiting that review to the 2001-2007 time period (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;5 NYCRR 11.9 [c] [2]).  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process of Law -- Decertification of Empire Zone Business Enterprise -- Hearing Not Required </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The lack of a hearing before the Empire Zone Designation Board during petitioner's appeal of the Commissioner of Economic Development's determination to decertify it as a participating business enterprise in the Empire Zones Program did not deprive petitioner of due process. The Empire Zones Act (General Municipal Law &sect;955 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) does not require the Board to hold such a hearing, and petitioner was offered an opportunity to submit documents to the Board to support its claim that it was entitled to continued certification. The decision to decertify petitioner was based upon a mathematical computation performed by the Department of Economic Development on figures that petitioner provided in its business annual reports, and petitioner had not challenged the accuracy of that calculation. Given the nature and scope of petitioner's principal complaint, which was directed at the propriety of the Commissioner's decision to limit its review of petitioner to the 2001-2007 time period, a hearing was not required for petitioner to be able to fully address that issue in its submissions to the Board.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Taking of Property -- Retroactive Application of Empire Zones Act Amendments -- Decertification of Empire Zone Business Enterprise</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The application of the 2009 amendments to the Empire Zones Act, making petitioner's decertification as a participating business enterprise in the Empire Zones Program (EZP) retroactive to 2008 and, as a result, depriving it of tax benefits and credits earned during the 2008 tax year, constituted an unlawful taking of its property without due process of law. Petitioner's certification as a participant in the EZP represented a property interest that was entitled to due process protection. Given that petitioner had fully complied with all the laws in place before the 2009 amendments were enacted and that none of the EZP participants were on notice that the rules governing certification would change, petitioner had every reason to expect that it could make investments in its business and rely upon the EZP's promise that it would receive commensurate tax relief. The additional state revenue generated by the retroactive application of the 2009 amendments, standing alone, could not justify governmental appropriation of private property. Moreover, respondents' objective of addressing alleged abuses in the EZP did not outweigh the prejudice resulting from severely penalizing an entity that had faithfully complied with the requirements of the EZP and legitimately earned its tax credits. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mortgage bank appealed a judgment by the Albany County Supreme Court (New York) that dismissed its combined CPLR art. 78 and declaratory judgment application to review a determination by respondent Banking Department, imposing an annual general assessment upon it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found, inter alia, that the annual general assessments were a fee, not a tax, because the purpose of the assessments was to recover the Department's expenses related to regulating banks from the banks that were regulated not to raise revenue for the support of government generally. The same formula was applied to all mortgage banks. Although the Department had not previously included income from mortgage servicing and secondary market activities for purposes of calculating the annual general assessment, it was reasonable to include that income because it was indirectly related to a mortgage bank's license, and failing to include such income could allow banks to structure transactions so as to avoid paying fees to the Department. Nevertheless, as no rule was properly promulgated pursuant to State Administrative Procedure Act &sect;&sect; 202, 203, N.Y. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8, the assessment could not be enforced and had to be annulled. The Department was to determine the bank's annual general assessment based on a properly promulgated rule or upon the bank's individual facts and circumstances. Accordingly, the bank was entitled to art. 78 and declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, the petition granted to the extent that the annual general assessment was annulled, the Department's methodology for determining the annual general assessment for mortgage banks was declared not arbitrary or capricious and did not result in an unconstitutional tax, and matter was remitted for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to vacate only raised the issue of personal jurisdiction, not the underlying merits of the support orders. The court had personal jurisdiction based on the claim in the support petitions that jurisdiction was proper under the long-arm statute,&nbsp;Family Ct Act &sect; 580-201(5). The parents failed to answer the petitions, move to dismiss them under CPLR 3211(a)(8), or appear in court in opposition to them. The parents waived any right to a hearing by submitting their motions on papers. The parents failed to preserve their jurisdiction claim. The court had jurisdiction over the parents under &sect; 580-201(5) since the parents' voluntary decision to place the children with the aunt in New York after they were arrested for child abuse and their formal acts in effectuating that decision constituted more than mere acquiescence. The parents purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities within New York, and the assertion of jurisdiction over the parents complied with due process. The claim that &sect; 580-201(5) was unconstitutionally void was not preserved.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff village filed an action against defendants, a developer and a town, seeking to annul the town's local law, which amended the town's zoning map. The developer and town moved to dismiss the petition under CPLR 3211 and 7804(f), arguing that the village lacked capacity to sue and lacked standing. The village challenged orders of the Supreme Court, Rockland County (New York), which granted the motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(3), the supreme court properly dismissed for lack of standing the cause of action seeking a declaration that the rezoning constituted improper and unconstitutional spot zoning inconsistent with the town's comprehensive plan. Villages had no interest in a town board's compliance with its comprehensive plan. The supreme court properly dismissed pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7) and 7804(f) the cause of action alleging that the rezoning violated General Municipal Law &sect; 239-nn and thus, was affected by error of law. Notice of the town's public hearings was provided, and the village did participate in the public hearings relating to the subject zoning action. The supreme court should have denied those branches of the motions that were pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(3), 3211(a)(7), and 7804(f) to dismiss the causes of action alleging violations of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), ECL art 8. The village established a demonstrated interest in the potential environmental impacts of the town's rezoning law and related resolutions sufficient to give it SEQRA standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When NYPA determined that it no longer needed a fee interest in the parcels at issue, it offered the owners the opportunity to purchase them. Unhappy with the appraised value, the owners commenced the underlying declaratory action alleging that, among other things, the original takings in 1955 and 1964 were excessive, illegal, and unconstitutional. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the owners offered no authority upon which to conclude that the statute of limitations for their EDPL 207(A) challenge to the extent of the appropriation commenced at any time other than when title vested in NYPA. Nor did they advance any persuasive reason why they or their predecessors in interest could not have challenged the extent of the appropriations in a timely manner. Consequently, dismissal pursuant to the doctrine of laches and CPLR 217(1) was appropriate. The owners' motions to amend and for reargument were properly denied as they were based on their claim that the appropriations were excessive, which claim had no merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found, inter alia, that &sect; 2808(5)(c) as written was unconstitutionally vague and improperly delegated legislative authority to the commissioner.

The statute did not adequately apprise nursing home owners and operators of the standards used to assess their equity withdrawal requests and precluded meaningful judicial review. Therefore, as &sect; 2808(5)(c) swept so broadly as to be irrational and arbitrary in view of the objective to be accomplished, i.e., ensuring the financial viability of nursing homes for the protection of their residents, it violated due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Niagara County Court (New York) that convicted him, among other things, of first-degree burglary and first-degree robbery; defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress DNA evidence because he lacked notice of the application seeking to compel him to provide a buccal swab and because the police used excessive force to obtain the swab.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's DNA matched evidence collected in two prior crimes, the People obtained a warrant to compel him to provide a buccal swab. When the swab that was obtained was &quot;compromised,&quot; a second order was issued. However, defendant was not provided with notice of the People's application for the second swab or served with the second order. Thereafter, when defendant refused to open his mouth, police officers applied a taser to his bare skin for several seconds in order to obtain the sample. The appellate court found, inter alia, that defendant's due process rights in N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 were violated when he was not afforded an opportunity to appear before the court and contest the second order compelling him to submit to the swab. Defendant's failure to object to the first order compelling him to provide a buccal swab did not constitute a waiver to any subsequent such orders. In addition, it was objectively unreasonable for the police to tase defendant in order to force him into submission. Finally, as there were less-intrusive alternatives, the DNA evidence should have been suppressed as an unconstitutional search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, the motion was granted, and a new trial was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Evidence -- DNA Identification Tests -- Due Process</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The People's failure to provide defendant with notice of their second application for a court order compelling him to submit to a second buccal swab after the DNA sample obtained from him pursuant to the first court order was compromised violated defendant's due process rights since he was not afforded an opportunity to appear before the court and contest the second order (US Const Amend XIV; NY Const, art I, &sect;6). Due process requires the People's application for an order to compel a suspect to provide a DNA sample to be made upon notice to the suspect where, as here, there are no exigencies that might frustrate the purpose of the application. Defendant's failure to appear in opposition to the People's first application for a buccal swab, even though he received notice of that application, did not constitute a waiver of his due process rights with respect to any subsequent such orders inasmuch as each order constituted a bodily intrusion warranting notice and an opportunity to be heard. While the People may not need to make a showing of probable cause upon each successive application, defendant could contest, among other things, the need for further buccal swabs and the availability of less intrusive means of obtaining a DNA sample. Accordingly, defendant was entitled to suppression of the DNA evidence obtained pursuant to the second order.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Use of Taser to Obtain Buccal Swab for DNA Testing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The use of a taser by police to obtain a buccal swab from defendant was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances, and, therefore, constituted excessive force under the Fourth Amendment, warranting suppression of the DNA evidence obtained. The record established that defendant posed no immediate threat to the safety of himself or the officers, willingly accompanied the officers to the police station, where he was placed in a secure room and handcuffed, and did not threaten, fight with, or physically resist the officers at any time. Defendant refused to open his mouth for, at most, 10 to 15 minutes after the police had asked him to comply with a court-ordered buccal swab of which he had no prior knowledge. Furthermore, there were no exigent circumstances to justify the failure to employ a less-intrusive alternative to obtain defendant's DNA, which, unlike blood-alcohol content or other types of evanescent evidence, was not susceptible to alteration, destruction or loss if not obtained in a timely manner. As a reasonable alternative to the use of the taser, the police could have arrested defendant for criminal contempt and then sought judicial approval to use physical force if necessary to extract the DNA sample.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Consolidation and Severance -- Offenses Defined by Same or Similar Statutory Provisions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying that part of defendant's omnibus motion seeking to sever the charges against him relating to two home invasions from the charges relating to a gas station robbery. Even though the home invasions and the gas station robbery were based upon different criminal transactions, the charges were properly joinable pursuant to CPL 200.20 (2) (c) because the offenses were defined by the same or similar statutory provisions. The record did not support defendant's contention that there was substantially more proof of his involvement in the home invasions than the gas station robbery (CPL 200.20 [3] [a]), where defendant was connected to both crimes by the presence of his DNA at or near the crime scenes, and no witnesses to either incident were able to identify defendant. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner providers brought a CPLR art. 78 proceeding, to, among other things, review implementation of Medicaid exempt income requirements by respondent office of mental health (OMH).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The OMH informed the providers that it would seek to recoup Medicaid exempt income that they had received for the years 2003 through 2009. The providers argued that the OMH's Medicaid exempt income recoupment policy lacked statutory or regulatory authority and that the OMH's reliance on guidelines, rather than a rule or regulation, violated State Administrative Procedures Act. However, the appellate court found that the enactment of L 2010, ch. 111, pt. D, &sect; 1, which expressly confirmed the OMH's existing authority to recoup Medicaid exempt income rendered these claims moot. Because the purpose of L 2010, ch. 111, pt. D was specific and the recoupment policy effected the intent of that statute, it was not necessary for the OMH to promulgate any formal rules or regulations before enforcing the recoupment policy. The providers also argued that the Medicaid exempt income that the OMH sought to recoup was an &quot;overpayment&quot; and, as such, that they were entitled to a hearing pursuant to 18 NYCRR 519.4 to assess the validity of the recoupment and to determine the amount each provider owed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State appealed an order of the Supreme Court, Bronx County (New York) finding the pretrial detention provisions of Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06(k) facially unconstitutional and ordering respondent sex offender's immediate release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General asserted that because Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06(k) incorporated a finding of dangerousness at the probable cause stage, release under strict and intensive supervision and treatment (SIST) represented a discretionary policy and was not constitutionally mandated. Thus, the Attorney General argued that committing the sex offender to a secure treatment facility pending trial did not violate any substantive or procedural due process guarantees, even if it was ultimately found that the sex offender required civil management under SIST. The appellate court held that a finding of probable cause to believe that a sex offender under Article 10 of the New York Mental Hygiene Law required civil management because of mental abnormality incorporated the necessary finding of dangerousness. The appellate court also noted that while the private interest was weighty, the risk of erroneous deprivation of such interest was limited by the statutory requirement of review prior to commencing a proceeding under Article 10, and by the statutory requirement of a judicial finding of probable cause to believe that a respondent is a sex offender requiring civil management.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the supreme court was reversed, and the order for sex offender's conditional release was vacated. The sex offender was ordered returned to detention pending completion of disposition pursuant to the Sex Offender Management and Treatment Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a proceeding arising out of Mental Hygiene Law article 10 pertaining to sex offenders requiring civil commitment or supervision, Supreme Court erred in attempting to determine, sua sponte, the facial constitutional validity of Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06 (k), which provides for the pretrial detention of certain offenders. The issue of facial unconstitutionality was not before the court. Respondent did not argue it, and in any such argument, it would be the challenger's burden to so argue and establish unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. Facial invalidation is an extraordinary remedy which is generally disfavored, and courts must avoid, if possible, interpreting a presumptively valid statute in a way that will needlessly render it unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Civil Commitment or Supervision -- Pretrial Detention</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06 (k), which provides for the pretrial detention of certain sex offenders, is not unconstitutional as applied to respondent, a convicted sex offender, as well as to that category of Mental Hygiene Law article 10 sex offenders who, at disposition, may be approved for release into the community under strict and intensive supervision and treatment (SIST). Article 10's definition of mental abnormality (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.03 [i]) incorporates a finding of a respondent's dangerousness, even if the word &quot;dangerous&quot; is not used in the statutory definition. Consequently, whether ultimately confined or released conditionally under SIST, all article 10 sex offenders are &quot;detained sex offenders&quot; where there is probable cause to believe they suffer a mental abnormality and where that is found at trial. The fact that a sex offender requiring SIST is defined as &quot;a detained sex offender who suffers from a mental abnormality but is not a dangerous sex offender requiring confinement&quot; (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.03 [r]), does not mean a sex offender who is not dangerous at all; rather, the statute should be interpreted to mean a sex offender who is not dangerous to the extent where his dangerousness must be managed by confinement. Significantly, the requirements of due process are met in providing for the civil commitment of sexual predators based on a finding of dangerousness resulting from a mental illness or mental abnormality that results in a serious lack of ability to control behavior, and article 10's scope encompasses only sex offenders who are dangerous enough to be confined without the need to consider less restrictive alternatives. Accordingly, the State may impose pretrial detention without showing that there were no lesser conditions than confinement to assure the safety of the community. The Legislature's decision to provide, as a discretionary policy, the less restrictive option of SIST to certain dangerous respondents after trial depends on implementing a carefully tailored and individualized program. (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.11 [a].) This does not create a mandatory constitutional obligation to offer such release before trial when the same safeguards and protections are absent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Civil Commitment or Supervision -- Pretrial Detention</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Mental Hygiene Law article 10, particularly Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06 (k), which provides for the pretrial detention of certain sex offenders, does not violate the New York State Constitution's mandate that mental health patients be treated in the &quot;least restrictive setting.&quot; The statute states clearly that sex offenders in need of civil management are a different population from traditional mental health patients (Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.01 [g]). &quot;Mental abnormality&quot; as used in the statute has no medical validity; it is a legal term containing an inherent meaning of dangerousness. Thus, while article 10 aims to treat the sex offender, it was nevertheless primarily enacted to protect the community from high risk sex offenders and, as in other statutes designed for the protection of the community, to remove the offender from the arena of possible action.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Academic and Moot Questions -- Mootness Exception -- Constitutionality of Pretrial Detention of Certain Sex Offenders Requiring Civil Management</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The issue of the constitutionality of Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.06 (k), which provides for the pretrial detention of certain sex offenders requiring civil management, as applied to respondent against whom a civil management petition was filed, will not be moot upon his dispositional hearing based on the view that once a disposition is made, the appellate courts would no longer need to decide whether the Attorney General sustained his burden of establishing that lesser conditions than confinement would not suffice to protect the public in the respondent's case. The issue raised by the respondent's as-applied constitutional challenge, and determined against him, was whether the Attorney General had that burden at all with regard to article 10 sex offenders. Accordingly, it is a challenge the Attorney General will be certain to face again from sex offenders in the same category as respondent, or those where the propriety of strict and intensive supervision and treatment would be immediately apparent, and the temporary nature of pretrial detention makes it unlikely that the constitutional issue will be decided before a respondent's dispositional hearing. Therefore, as an issue likely to arise in other cases, but likely to evade review, it meets the exception to mootness. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff challenger appealed the order of the Supreme Court, Onondaga County (New York), which denied plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment and granted summary judgment dismissing the action to defendants, a county and its assigned counsel program. Plaintiff brought a declaratory judgment action seeking to invalidate the assigned counsel program, which was established pursuant to County Law art. 18-B.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assigned counsel program plan was established by the county through a contract with the county bar association. Plaintiff contended that the contract and handbook containing the assigned counsel plan was illegal, ultra vires and/or a nullity and, as written, were unconstitutional. Plaintiff primarily asserted that the plan deprived criminal defendants of their right to counsel and violated County Law art. 18-B in several respects. First, the court found that the trial court erred by dismissing the declaratory judgment action rather than declaring the rights of the parties. In examining the plan, however, the court found that it was valid but for the provision regarding assignment by a court and client eligibility, which prohibited attorneys from representing nonincarcerated criminal defendants until there was a determination of their eligibility, and thus it required attorneys to violate the indelible right to counsel that attached at arraignment. Otherwise, the court found the plan statutorily authorized and properly approved as it existed.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance was invalid under the Department of Transportation's (DOT) &quot;access highway&quot; regulations, 17 NYCRR 8000.7(a)(2), 8114.00(q), (ae), allowing truck traffic on access highways, because (1) it barred trucks from roads DOT designated as &quot;access roads,&quot; (2) the city's authority in Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1640 did not trump DOT's authority to designate access highways in Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1627(b), limiting cities' authority to regulate truck traffic, and (3) &sect; 1627(b) did not limit access roads to highways that were part of the state highway system.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sued defendants city, police department, and officer, seeking to recover damages for personal injuries and for civil rights violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The Supreme Court, Dutchess County (New York), denied a motion filed by the city, the police department, and the officer which was for summary judgment dismissing six of the claims. The city, the police department, and the officer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from the officer's actions in an incident in which the patient, an epileptic, refused transport to the hospital after having suffered seizures. The appellate court found that the city, the police department, and the officer failed to eliminate a triable issue as to whether the officer's use of a taser to restrain the patient, either to arrest him or to restrain him for his own safety, was excessive. The trial court thus properly denied the motion as to the common law excessive force and assault and battery claims. With respect to the patient's disorderly conduct arrest, there was evidence that the patient was engaged in tumultuous behavior, but a triable fact issue remained as to whether a reasonable officer could have interpreted the patient's behavior as being motivated by an intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm for purposes of Penal Law &sect; 240.20(1). In addition, although the patient might nevertheless have recklessly caused public inconvenience, there was a triable fact issue as to whether the &quot;public&quot; was inconvenienced. These fact issues precluded summary judgment for the officer on the ground of qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, operators of check cashing establishments, sued defendant town, seeking, inter alia, a judgment declaring that Hempstead, N.Y., Building Zone Ordinance art. XXXI, &sect; 302(K), was void. The Nassau County Supreme Court (New York) granted the town's motion for summary judgment; plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 302(K) banned check-cashing establishments within the town in any districts other than industrial and light manufacturing districts. Preexisting check-cashing establishments like plaintiffs' located in districts where such establishments would be banned under &sect; 302(K) were required to terminate by amortization no later than five years after the effective date of &sect; 302(K). In support of their claim that &sect; 302(K) was void, plaintiffs argued that because the field was preempted by the State of New York, the town was precluded from enacting legislation in the same area. The appellate court agreed. Section 302(K) was invalid pursuant to the doctrine of conflict preemption. In adopting &sect; 302(K), the town determined that check-cashing establishments were  appropriate only in the town's industrial and light manufacturing districts. However, Banking Law &sect; 369 delegated to the New York Superintendent of Banks the task of determining whether particular locations were appropriate for check-cashing establishments. Therefore, the town's attempt to control the determination of the appropriate locations of these establishments by enactment of &sect; 302(K) was in conflict with state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the matter was remitted to the trial court for the entry of a judgment declaring that &sect; 302(K) was void and of no effect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Town Regulation of Check-Cashing Establishments </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A town ordinance that restricted check-cashing establishments to certain areas of the town, requiring preexisting establishments to terminate or relocate to industrial or light manufacturing districts in the town within five years, was invalid pursuant to the doctrine of conflict preemption. Through the enactment and amendment of Banking Law &sect; 369, the Legislature specifically delegated to the Superintendent of Banks the task of determining whether particular locations were appropriate for check-cashing establishments. The ordinance purported to accomplish the same function delegated by the Legislature to the Superintendent of Banks by making a determination as to the appropriate location for check-cashing establishments. By permitting such establishments to be located only within the town's industrial and light manufacturing districts, the ordinance purported to divest the Superintendent of the authority to &quot;determine whether there is a community need for a new licensee in the proposed area to be served&quot; (Banking Law &sect; 369 [1]). In adopting the ordinance, the town necessarily determined that, in its estimation, check-cashing establishments were only appropriate in certain districts. As a direct consequence of the ordinance, existing check-cashing establishments at locations in the town's business district, each of which was necessarily determined by the Superintendent to be appropriately located to serve a community need, would find themselves in violation of a provision of the town's ordinance. Because that violation did not exist under state law, and because the Legislature vested the Superintendent with the authority to determine appropriate locations for check-cashing establishments, the ordinance was preempted by state law. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Under the 2009 amendments to the Empire Zones Act that revised certain eligibility criteria for business enterprises and directed the Commissioner of the Department of Economic Development to conduct a review of all businesses receiving tax credits under the Empire Zones Program to determine whether they should be decertified pursuant to the new eligibility criteria (General Municipal Law &sect; 959 [a] [v] [5], [6]; [w]), the revocations of plaintiffs' certifications of eligibility were intended to be effective for the taxable year commencing January 1, 2008. Although the 2009 amendments were to &quot;take effect immediately,&quot; when a statute is to take effect and whether the statute applies retroactively are distinct issues. Furthermore, while the Legislature has no power to declare, retroactively, that an existing statute shall receive a construction contrary to that which the statute would ordinarily have received, the Legislature's enactment of legislation in 2010 to clarify the effective date of decertifications was consistent with the 2009 amendments. The legislative history suggested that the 2009 amendments were intended, in part, to generate revenue during 2009-2010, revenue that would not be generated if those amendments were to be applied prospectively. In addition, each of the contemporaneous amendments to the Tax Law affecting carryover tax credits referred to the retention certificate issued to business enterprises that satisfied the new eligibility criteria set forth in General Municipal Law &sect; 959 (a) (v) (5) and (6), and those Tax Law amendments were expressly effective retroactive to January 1, 2008. The Legislature's subsequent statement of its earlier intent was entitled to great weight.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process of Law -- Retroactive Application of Empire Zones Act Amendments -- Revocation of Tax Credits</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The retroactive application of the 2009 amendments to the Empire Zones Act that revised certain eligibility criteria for business enterprises receiving tax credits under the Empire Zones Program deprived plaintiff businesses of their property interests in violation of due process of law to the extent that the revocations of plaintiffs' certificates of eligibility were made effective for the taxable year commencing January 1, 2008. Plaintiffs had no warning that the criteria for certification were going to change, prospectively or retroactively, prior to April 2009, and had maintained their eligibility for the tax credits throughout the taxable year beginning January 1, 2008 pursuant to the criteria then in effect. They did not merely rely on the continuing tax credits, but were induced to conduct their businesses in a particular way in specified disadvantaged areas in reliance upon their availability. Under such circumstances, the tax credits induced action in reliance thereon and thus could not be invalidated by subsequent legislation. Finally, defendants failed to explain what legitimate public purpose was served by the retroactive application of the 2009 amendments. The only justification offered, that the retroactive elimination of the tax credits would generate additional revenue for the State, was insufficient as balanced against the inequity to plaintiffs. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent administration for children's services (ACS) filed petitions against respondents, a child's stepfather and mother, alleging that the child was abused. Pursuant to Family Ct Act &sect; 1027(g), the Kings County Family Court (New York) ordered ACS to arrange for a forensic medical examination of the child. Appellant, the child's attorney, filed a motion to vacate this order. The trial court denied the motion; the attorney appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Just before she turned 14, the child gave birth to a baby; DNA testing established a 99.97 percent chance that the child's  stepfather was the father. The appellate court noted that a victim such as the child was entitled to no less protection under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, than her stepfather would enjoy as an accused. Adolescent vulnerability intensified the intrusiveness of the exposure and could result in serious emotional damage. Given the conclusive evidence of the child's sexual abuse by her stepfather provided by the DNA test results, the State's need to subject the child to a highly intrusive physical examination was so diminished as to render the search unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend IV. Therefore, the mandated application of 1027(g) to the child under the particular facts of this case was unreasonable and violated her Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Construction -- Avoidance of Constitutional Issue </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a child protective proceeding in which the allegedly abused child contended that Family Court Act &sect; 1027 (g), which requires forensic medical examination in all cases of alleged child abuse, was violative of her Fourth Amendment rights, the statute should not be read as affording the Family Court discretion to dispose of exams where they are unnecessary or unwarranted. Under established principles of judicial restraint, courts should not address constitutional issues when a decision can be reached on other grounds; however, a court may not avoid a constitutional issue by interpreting a challenged statute in a manner which contravenes its plain wording and legislative purpose. A statute will not be read to dictate an absurd or unreasonable result, and when interpreting a statute, the judiciary must first look to its plain language, which here provides that the court shall order examinations in all abuse cases. Moreover, given the mandatory nature of an order directing an examination, the order authorizing and directing a medical examination of the subject child should not be vacated on the basis that the court ordered the child protective agency, rather than a court-appointed professional, to arrange for the examination, so as to avoid reaching the constitutional issue.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parent and Child -- Abused or Neglected Child -- Physical Examination of Abused Child </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The mandated application of Family Court Act &sect;1027 (g), which requires forensic medical examination in all cases of alleged child abuse, was unreasonable and violative of an abused child's Fourth Amendment rights, where the child gave birth to a daughter when she was just shy of her 14th birthday, a DNA test established a 99.97% probability that the father was the subject child's stepfather, and more than two years had elapsed before the medical examination was ordered. Strip searches and visual body cavity searches implicate fundamental Fourth Amendment rights, and the alleged victim was entitled to no less protection under the Fourth Amendment than her stepfather would enjoy as an accused. The effect of a search on the child must be balanced against the state's &quot;extraordinarily weighty&quot; interest in protecting children, as well as its interest in protecting the rights of those accused of child abuse. The statute's examination policy is generally effective in discovering and preserving evidence of abuse; however, the state's interests did not require a medical examination of the subject child since DNA evidence of paternity already conclusively established that the stepfather sexually abused the child and indelibly preserved unequivocal evidence of the abuse. While a physical examination and colored photographs taken of the victim more than two years after the birth of her daughter have the possibility, albeit remote, of revealing additional evidence of abuse, the examination, as a tool of early and accurate diagnoses, had been rendered, at best, cumulative and, at worst, superfluous. </SPAN></P>

The owner counterclaimed, challenging the lien procedures. The Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), among other things, denied the owner's motion for summary judgment declaring the lien provisions of the Navigation Law to be unconstitutional. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that Navigation Law &sect; 181-a required that, before a lien was filed, there had to be a judicial determination that the person who owned the property was liable to the fund. The owner asserted that the absence of the word &quot;potentially&quot; in &sect; 181-a(1)(a) connoted a legislative intent to require a judicial determination of liability before an environmental lien could have been filed. The appellate court disagreed. The statute made no specific mention of a judicial determination as a prerequisite to filing a lien. The absence of the word &quot;potentially&quot; in &sect; 181-a(1)(a) was insufficient to provide a sound basis for reading such a requirement into the statute. While the risk of erroneous deprivation due to an environmental lien was not reduced to the same level as matters supported by documentary proof, nevertheless the risk was low given that liability under the Oil Spill Act, Navigation Law art. 12, was strict, joint, and several, and the statute had been broadly and liberally applied to owners where a petroleum discharge was discovered. The owner failed to establish that the Oil Spill Act violated due process because it lacked a pre-filing hearing procedure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Gas and Oil -- Oil Spill Cleanup -- Environmental Lien - Statutory Procedure </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Navigation Law &sect; 181-a did not require a judicial determination of liability before an environmental lien could be filed by the State upon real property owned by defendant for costs incurred by the Environmental Protection and Spill Compensation Fund (Fund) for the cleanup of a petroleum discharge. The statute makes no specific mention of a judicial determination as a prerequisite to filing a lien upon real property &quot;owned by a person liable&quot; (Navigation Law &sect;181-a [1] [a]) to the Fund. Although the phrase &quot;potentially liable&quot; is used elsewhere in the Oil Spill Act (Navigation Law art 12), the absence of the word &quot;potentially&quot; in Navigation Law &sect; 181-a (1) (a) is insufficient to read the requirement of a judicial determination of liability into the statute when read in the context of the entire statutory article. The Oil Spill Act was enacted to accomplish speedy, effective cleanups when spills occur and its provisions are to be &quot;liberally construed to effect its purposes&quot; (Navigation Law &sect; 195). The environmental lien is tied to a sense of urgency to act, as the legislative history reveals a concern about a party frustrating Fund reimbursement by quickly disposing of the property. Thus, if the Legislature had intended to require a judicial determination of liability prior to the filing of an environmental lien, it would have affirmatively so stated and provided guidance as to the procedural issues pertinent to such a determination.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

While the environmental lien clouded title and affected defendant's ability to transfer the property, the risk of erroneous deprivation was low given that liability under the Oil Spill Act is strict, joint and several, and the statute has been broadly and liberally applied to owners of real property where a discharge is discovered. Defendant was given prior notice that the lien would be filed, the amount of the lien was established, and the lien was not filed until the underlying action was commenced. Although a prefiling hearing was not provided, defendant could challenge the lien within the context of the pending action or seek a vacatur under Lien Law &sect; 59 (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Navigation Law &sect; 181-d). Defendant failed to show that those procedures did not provide the expeditious postdeprivation review required by due process. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee sued defendants city and officer, seeking to recover damages for assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent hiring and supervision, and for civil rights violations pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York), among other things, denied a motion which was for summary judgment filed by the city and the officer. The city and the officer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee alleged that, after his arrest, police officers unnecessarily used a taser on him several times while he was handcuffed. The appellate court found that the city and the officer failed to make a prima facie showing of their entitlement to judgment dismissing the assault and battery claim. A municipality may have been vicariously liable on such a state law claim under a respondeat superior theory. The city and the officer did, however, establish the city's entitlement to summary judgment on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, since such a claim could not have been brought against a governmental entity. However, the officer was not entitled to summary judgment on this claim. The actions complained of occurred during the arrest by several police officers in the scope of their employment with the city. Since the city was subject to vicarious liability, the arrestee was not allowed to proceed with a negligent hiring and supervision claim. The city and the officer made a prima facie showing that the police officers were adequately trained by the city with regard to the use of tasers. In opposition, the arrestee failed to raise a triable issue of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was modified by granting the motion of the city and the officer for summary judgment dismissing the second, third, and fourth causes of action insofar as asserted against the city and the third cause of action insofar as asserted against the officer. As so modified, the order was affirmed insofar as appealed from.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also properly limited the recipients' recovery to the restoration of monthly food stamp benefits which they would have received had the GHSBP not been implemented, as they were already entitled to this relief pursuant to their successful contention that the GHSBP was invalid by virtue of its implementation in the absence of a proper and formal rulemaking procedure. The trial court also properly, in effect, declared that the GHSBP did not violate N.Y. Const. art. XVII, &sect; 1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State brought a sex offender civil management petition pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law art. 10 against respondent patient. The Supreme Court, Franklin County (New York), granted the patient's motion to dismiss the petition. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient moved to dismiss on the ground that due process precluded the State from pursuing civil management of a sex offender when the commission of a sex offense had not yet been proven and the patient lacked the capacity to stand trial with respect to that charge. The appellate court held initially that the proceeding was not rendered moot by a federal court proceeding. The State conceded that it had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the patient engaged in the conduct constituting the charged offense. Overriding the patient's significant liberty interest was the State's strong interest in both protecting the public from those who were dangerously mentally ill and providing treatment for those individuals if they were unable to care for themselves. The State had long had authority under its police power to protect the community from the dangerous tendencies of some who were mentally ill and this interest was of the highest order. The battery of protections in an art. 10 proceeding reduced the risk that the patient would have been erroneously deprived of liberty. Due process did not preclude the State from pursuing sex offender civil management of the patient.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A proceeding pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law article 10 seeking sex offender civil management of respondent, who lacked the mental capacity to stand trial for the underlying sexual assault and reached the maximum period of commitment possible under CPL article 730, was not rendered moot by a permanent injunction issued by a federal district court which mandated that the State, in order to comply with constitutional due process, prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an incapacitated sex offender committed the underlying sex offense before proceeding under Mental Hygiene Law article 10. On its face, the federal injunction did not prohibit the civil management of all sex offenders found incapacitated to stand trial under CPL article 730. Rather, the injunction severed the phrase &quot;by clear and convincing evidence&quot; from Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.07 (d) and required the higher reasonable doubt standard, leaving the rest of the statute effective. Since a vacatur of the federal injunction on appeal would cause the statute to go back in full force and effect, the dispute over its validity was still live. In any event, the subject matter jurisdiction of the state court was not affected, since there is parallelism, but not paramountcy, between the state courts and lower federal courts with respect to passing on federal constitutional questions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process of Law -- Civil Management of Dangerous Sex Offender Lacking Mental Capacity to Stand Trial</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Mental Hygiene Law &sect; 10.07 (d), which permits the State to seek sex offender civil management of a respondent who lacked the mental capacity to stand trial and was never convicted of the underlying sex offense, does not deprive such a respondent of his or her right to constitutional due process, given the State's strong interest in providing treatment to sex offenders with mental abnormalities and protecting the public from their recidivistic conduct. A Mental Hygiene Law article 10 proceeding is civil in nature in which the primary inquiry is whether a respondent suffers from a mental abnormality requiring civil management or commitment, and, accordingly, does not run afoul of the blanket due process prohibition on trying incapacitated criminal defendants. Nevertheless, civil commitment for any purpose constitutes a significant deprivation of liberty for which due process requires the State to minimize the risk of an erroneous deprivation. A battery of procedural protections in Mental Hygiene Law article 10 ameliorates the risk that an incapacitated respondent will be erroneously deprived of liberty. A respondent is extended the right to counsel, extensive discovery, the right to be assessed by a psychiatric evaluator of his or her choosing, the right to call witnesses, introduce evidence and testify on his or her own behalf, and a unanimous verdict of 12 jurors is required to find him or her to be a detained sex offender suffering from a mental abnormality. Moreover, the State must demonstrate that respondent committed acts constituting a sex offense beyond a reasonable doubt. If those protections do not prevent a respondent's erroneous confinement, further remedies are available, including the right to apply for release at any time and to be evaluated annually, with the burden on the State to demonstrate that continued confinement is appropriate. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the birth of a child via surrogate, plaintiffs, the genetic and gestational parents, sought a judgment declaring the genetic parents to be the child's legal parents and enjoining the hospital and the department of health (DOH) from issuing a birth certificate identifying the gestational parents as the legal parents. The Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), granted DOH's motion to dismiss under CPLR 3211(a)(7). The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amended complaint sought to declare Domestic Relations Law art. 8, which was enacted to prohibit commercial surrogacy and to preclude a gestational carrier from being contractually compelled to relinquish her parental rights, and Family Ct Act &sect;&sect; 517 and 542, allowing a genetic father, but not a genetic mother, to obtain an order of filiation, to be unconstitutional. The trial court erred in finding that it could not make a declaration as to whether the genetic mother was the legal mother of the subject child, and in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The trial court had the inherent authority under Family Ct Act art. 4 to determine whether a female was, in fact, a child's legal parent. An order relating to adoption was not necessary for the issuance of a new birth certificate pursuant to Public Health Law &sect; 4138(1)(b). Furthermore, whether there was an impermissible gender-based classification between parents after the birth of the child was a valid question. Accordingly, the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint, finding that no cause of action was stated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In an action to amend the birth certificate of a child born to a surrogate mother, who became pregnant after the egg of the genetic mother was fertilized with the sperm of the genetic father through in vitro fertilization and transferred into her uterus, the fact that article 5 of the Family Court Act addresses only &quot;Paternity Proceedings&quot; rather than maternity proceedings deprived neither the Family Court nor the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to issue an order of maternity. Such an approach is consistent with General Construction Law &sect; 22 which mandates that the construction of statutes containing &quot;gender indicative words&quot; should be deemed to refer to &quot;both male or female persons.&quot; Although there is no statutory provision providing for a declaration of maternity, there is also no provision prohibiting such declaration. Moreover, the Family Court has the inherent authority under article 4 of the Family Court Act to determine whether a female is, in fact, a child's legal parent. Consequently, the Supreme Court, as a court of general jurisdiction, has the authority to determine whether a child's genetic mother is indeed the child's legal mother.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a proceeding to amend the birth certificate of a child born to a surrogate mother, who became pregnant after the egg of the genetic mother was fertilized with the sperm of the genetic father through in vitro fertilization and transferred into her uterus, the Supreme Court had the authority to issue an order of maternity to the genetic mother absent her recourse to a formal adoption proceeding. Based on the plain reading of Public Health Law &sect; 4138 (1) (b), an order relating to adoption is not necessary for the issuance of a new birth certificate. Once a court of competent jurisdiction issues an order or judgment &quot;relating to the parentage,&quot; the Commissioner of the Department of Health, upon notification, &quot;shall&quot; issue a new certificate of birth pursuant to the statute. Although adoption was an alternate means to amend the birth certificate, adoptions are complicated and may be costly. The biological link between the child and the genetic mother provided a preexisting relationship that could not be ignored. The relief requested did not interfere with the reporting requirements of article 41 of the Public Health Law as plaintiffs only requested that a hearing be held shortly after birth as part of a declaratory judgment action to adjudicate the child's legal parentage, not an order that a gestational carrier's name never appear on a child's birth certificate. Moreover, a declaratory judgment action was the most appropriate mechanism to adjudicate legal parentage.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In an action to amend the birth certificate of a child born to a surrogate mother, who became pregnant after the egg of the genetic mother was fertilized with the sperm of the genetic father through in vitro fertilization and transferred into her uterus, plaintiffs stated a valid cause of action alleging that Family Court Act &sect;&sect; 517 and 542 violated the genetic mother's rights to equal protection since the genetic father was able to obtain an order of filiation from the court while denying that same protection and enforcement of the same fundamental liberty interest to the similarly situated genetic mother, and that article 8 of the Domestic Relations Law, which was enacted to prohibit commercial surrogacy and to preclude a gestational carrier from being contractually compelled to relinquish her parental rights, violated due process if it were read to presume that the gestational mother was the legal mother of the child and to preclude the genetic mother from establishing her parental relationship to the child. The issue was not whether there is a distinction between males and females in the birth process, as there most assuredly is; rather, the issue as framed in the amended complaint was whether there was an impermissible gender-based classification between parents after the birth of the child. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner legislators brought an action, inter alia, pursuant to CPLR art. 78 against respondent county, and others, challenging Nassau County, N.Y. Local Law No. 3 (2011). The Supreme Court, Nassau County (New York), granted summary judgment declaring that Local Law No. 3 was null and void, but ruled that the adoption of Local Law No. 3 was in accord with Nassau County, N.Y. Charter &sect; 112. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared Local Law No. 3 null and void for lack of compliance with Nassau County, N.Y., Charter &sect;&sect; 113 114. The legislators argued Local Law No. 3-2011, which redrew the metes and bounds of the county's 19 legislative districts based on the results of the 2010 decennial federal census, failed to comply with the requirements of &sect;&sect; 112, 113, 114. The appellate court found that the trial court properly declared that the adoption of Local Law No. 3-2011 was in accordance with the requirements of &sect; 112. The legislature, as required, adopted a local law amending Nassau County, N.Y., Charter Annex A to describe the 19 legislative districts, based upon the new census data, and did so within six months of the announcement of the census data. However, the trial court erred in concluding that the resultant metes and bounds only constituted new proposed legislative districts. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court overlooked a crucial term used in &sect; 112. Local Law No. 3 was not inconsistent with, and did not purport to supersede, the Election Law in contravention of N.Y. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner/plaintiff solid waste hauler appealed a judgment by the Westchester County Supreme Court (New York) that denied its CPLR art. 78 petition, and, in effect, determined that Westchester County, N.Y., Laws &sect; 826-a.700 was not unconstitutional, and dismissed its proceeding against defendants, County and County Solid Waste Commission (the SWC); the hauler claimed that &sect; 826-a.700 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the hauler's general manager was indicted on two counts-racketeering and racketeering conspiracy in connection with his alleged participation in an illegal &quot;property rights&quot; system in the carting industry, the SWC required the hauler to enter into a  contract with an independent auditor pursuant to &sect; 826-a.700 if it wished to continue its operations. The appellate court found, inter a alia that contrary to the hauler's contention, &sect; 826-a.700 was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The SWC had broad discretion to impose an independent auditor as a condition of the issuance, reinstatement, and/or renewal of a license. The conduct of the hauler's former general manager provided a rational basis for the SWC's determination that the hauler must enter into a contract with an independent auditor as a condition of renewal of its license. The hauler's remaining challenges to the constitutionality of &sect; 826-a.700 were without merit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals from three CPLR art. 78 proceedings, respondent public benefit corporation appealed from orders of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), granting petitions to annul the public benefit corporation's decision to layoff carpenters, electricians, and laborers. Petitioners consist of elected officials, labor union representatives and union members (collectively, the unions).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public benefit corporation sought to restructure its organization to make it more cost efficient. As part of this effort, it made the layoffs in dispute. The unions argued that the layoffs could have potentially created conditions that would have violated unspecified health laws and regulations. The trial court should have dismissed the petitions because the unions lacked standing and failed to state a claim for injunctive relief under Public Health Law &sect; 2801-c where they relied upon threatened, not actual, violations of the public health laws. Section 2801-c authorized injunctive relief only for violations of specified provisions of the Public Health Law or regulations adopted thereunder, not for claimed violations of N.Y. Unconsolidated Laws or for unspecified violations. Further, the question of whether the scheduled layoffs would have left the public benefit corporation with a sufficient staff to satisfy its statutory obligations presented a nonjusticiable controversy. Finally, even assuming the unions had standing to challenge the layoffs, the layoff decision was not arbitrary and capricious and was founded on a rational basis pursuant to CPLR 7803(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders which granted the petitions to annul layoff determination, vacated the injunctions, denied the petitions, and dismissed the CPLR art. 78 proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Challenge to Decision by Public Hospital Corporation to Lay Off Certain Workers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioners, elected public officials and members and officials of trade worker unions, failed to satisfy both the &quot;injury in fact&quot; and &quot;zone of interest&quot; prongs of the test to establish standing to challenge the decision of a public hospital corporation to lay off certain maintenance staff as violative of McKinney's Unconsolidated Laws of NY &sect;&sect;7382 and 7385 (7) (New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation Act [L 1969, ch 1016, &sect; 1, as amended (HHC Act)] &sect;&sect; 2, 5 [7]), which require the corporation to operate, manage, superintend, control, repair, maintain and otherwise keep up its health facilities, and Public Health Law &sect;&sect; 2800 and 2803, as well as specified Department of Health Regulations promulgated thereunder (10 NYCRR 405.24, 702.1, 702.2, 702.3, 711.2, 711.4), which require the corporation to maintain its health facilities in a manner so as to assure a safe and suitable environment for patients. Petitioners' claim that the scheduled layoffs would leave the hospitals in question so short-staffed that the mandate of the Public Health Law to provide high quality health services would be violated was speculative. Petitioners' claims asserted only threatened, not actual, violations of the law, and pointed to no specific violation of any building code provision which would, as a result of the impending layoffs, actually occur and cause injury to them. Additionally, the asserted &quot;injury&quot; was neither separate nor distinct from that of the public at large. Nor were petitioners within the &quot;zone of interest&quot; sought to be promoted or protected by the statutory provisions under which the corporation acted: the regulations cited by petitioners that the corporation allegedly violated mostly provided for the benefit and protection of patients, with any benefits derived by hospital staff being incidental. Moreover, to the extent that certain regulations do mention staff and personnel, any claimed violations thereof remained wholly theoretical and unsubstantiated. Further, neither section 7382 nor section 7385 (7) of the Unconsolidated Laws of NY (HHC Act &sect;&sect; 2, 5 [7]) imposes enforceable legal duties upon the corporation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Justiciable Questions -- Challenge to Decision by Public Hospital Corporation to Lay Off Certain Workers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The question of whether respondent New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation's scheduled layoffs of certain maintenance staff positions would leave the corporation without sufficient staff to satisfy its statutory obligations to operate, manage, superintend, control, repair, maintain and otherwise keep up its health facilities, and to maintain its health facilities in a manner so as to assure a safe and suitable environment for patients presented a nonjusticiable controversy. Inasmuch as the Legislature saw fit to give the corporation the discretion to determine the number of nonmanagerial employees necessary to carry out its mission (McKinney's Uncons Laws of NY &sect; 7385 [12]; &sect; 7382 [New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation Act (L 1969, ch 1016, &sect; 1, as amended) &sect; 5 (12); &sect; 2]), its decisions regarding staffing levels were beyond judicial review. Petitioners failed to identify any law or regulations requiring the corporation to employ maintenance staff at a specific level or to determine maintenance staff levels in accordance with a particular standard or formula. Statutory requirements that public agencies maintain their facilities in a safe and sanitary condition do not give rise to judicially enforceable rights to employment of maintenance staff at any given level. Moreover, the statutory right to a safe workplace may not be enforced by means of a remedy at law which would require the judiciary to preempt the exercise of discretion by the executive branch of government.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation -- Judicial Review of Decision to Lay Off Certain Workers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The decision of a public hospital corporation to lay off certain maintenance staff in response to city budget cuts and other financial issues affecting its operations was not arbitrary and capricious, and was founded on a rational basis. There was no reason to apply the &quot;substantial evidence&quot; test to the corporation's determination since there was no administrative hearing held or required prior to the determination. The record showed that the layoff decision was rational in light of the imperative to reduce costs in conjunction with the corporation's statutory mandate to provide medical services to all. The undisputed facts showed that the corporation took its massive restructuring effort seriously, as evidenced by the creation of a high level steering committee and retention of the services of an outside consultant to assist in a review of all of its current operations. After a nine-month review, the consultant provided the steering committee with a voluminous report detailing 100 cost-cutting options as well as presenting the risks and mission impact of each. The committee thoughtfully reviewed those recommendations and selected 39. There was nothing that mandated the corporation to utilize any particular methodology in making its staffing determination. Moreover, there was nothing in the record to show that the layoff decision was arrived at in bad faith or without adequate facts or deliberation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The local laws in question regulated who could take, and the manner of taking, &quot;shellfish&quot; from waters within the town. The fishermen alleged that the town impermissibly prohibited anyone but freeholders, residents, temporary residents, or taxpayers who possessed a permit issued by the town from taking crabs, conchs, and shrimp from the navigable waters of the town. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the original town patent did not grant the Trustees the exclusive rights to use the navigable waters in the town or to take migratory fish from them. The town board was empowered by Town Law &sect; 130(19) to pass an ordinance prohibiting a trespass on both public and private property. However, the record was not sufficiently developed to determine whether the fishermen's methods of taking migratory fish constituted a trespass or if they could remove crabs and conchs without disturbing a town's land under the waters. Consequently, the fishermen were not entitled to a preliminary injunction to enjoin the enforcement of the local laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon defendant's guilty plea, the Supreme Court, Kings County (New York), convicted defendant of burglary in the second degree, criminal contempt in the first degree, and criminal contempt in the second degree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court lacked the authority to issue an order of protection which would remain in effect for eight years beyond the expiration of his five-year determinate term of imprisonment because he committed the offenses to which he pled guilty before CPL 530.12(5) was amended to increase the maximum duration of final orders of protection. However, the appellate court found that the legislative history made clear that the 2006 amendment increasing the maximum permissible duration of orders of protection issued pursuant to CPL 530.12(5), 530.13(4) was intended to provide greater protection to victims and witnesses, rather than to punish defendants. A statute which was enacted for nonpunitive purposes, and was not so punitive in effect as to negate that nonpunitive intent, may have been retroactively applied without violating the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10(1). Application of the 2006 amendment extending the maximum duration of final orders of protection issued pursuant to CPL 530.12(5) to crimes committed before its effective date did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's waiver of his right to appeal was unenforceable where the trial court's statement during the plea allocution that if defendant were to be &quot;tried and convicted&quot; he would have the right to appeal but that he was now giving up that right was misleading because it suggested that only defendants who are convicted after trial have a right to appeal. Furthermore, instead of eliciting a specific acknowledgment that defendant was waiving his right to appeal, the court followed up its explanation by asking defendant whether he was willing to &quot;give up all those rights and any other rights&quot; he possessed and now plead guilty. Without any indication in the record that defendant understood the distinction between the right to appeal and other trial rights which are automatically forfeited incident to a plea of guilty, it cannot be said that he knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution in which defendant's challenge to the duration of an order of protection was unpreserved for appellate review because he did not raise the issue at sentencing or move to amend the order of protection on that ground, the Appellate Division exercised the discretion it possesses to review unpreserved claims in the interest of justice (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 470.15 [6] [a]) and reviewed defendant's challenge in order to clarify whether it was permissible to retroactively apply the 2006 amendment to CPL 530.12 (5), which extended the maximum duration of orders of protection, to crimes committed prior to its effective date.  </SPAN></P>

The issuance of an order of protection is not a form of punishment and there is no constitutional impediment to the application of the 2006 amendment to CPL 530.12 (5), which extended the maximum duration of a final order of protection issued in favor of the victim of a felony family offense from five years to eight years, to crimes committed before the effective date of the amendment. It was entirely proper for a sentencing court to issue a final order of protection in accordance with the version of the statute in effect at sentencing, rather than the version in effect when the subject offenses were committed. The legislative history of the amendment made it clear that its intent was to provide greater protection to victims and witnesses, rather than to punish defendants. The amendment, which merely extended the permissible duration of orders of protection, was not so punitive in its consequences as to transform an order of protection into punishment. Moreover, there was no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 10 [1]), which only applies to penal statutes which disadvantage the offender affected by them and does not prohibit retroactive application of a statute which is enacted for nonpunitive purposes, and is not so punitive in effect as to negate that nonpunitive intent. </SPAN></P>

In addition, a majority of the developer's board was comprised of local officials. The close relationship between the developer and local governments persuaded the appellate court that the developer was the type of entity that the Legislature intended to subject to the provisions of the PAAA. As the developer was created by, sponsored by and/or affiliated with the local government within the meaning of the PAAA, it qualified as a &quot;local authority&quot; for purposes of Public Authorities Law &sect; 2(2)(b).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a citizens group and members of its board of directors, filed a combined CPLR art. 78 proceeding and declaratory judgment action against respondents, the Empire State Stem Cell Board (ESSCB) and the New York Commissioner of Health, seeking to annul ESSCB's resolution permitting certain researchers to compensate oocyte donors. The Albany County Supreme Court (New York) dismissed the action; appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members, but not the group, appealed the trial court's finding that petitioners lacked standing. The appellant court held that the members lacked standing under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b as citizen taxpayers to challenge the resolution on the ground the standards developed by ESSCB's ethics committee were inadequate to ensure that the consent of compensated donors would be truly voluntary, as this was a challenge to the manner in which the donor compensation program was conducted, rather than to ESSCB's authority to conduct it. The members lacked common law standing as taxpayers on the informed consent issue, as there was no showing that an oocyte donor would be unable to challenge the procedures used to obtain her informed consent. The use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create stem cells did not constitute &quot;human reproductive cloning&quot; within the meaning of Public Health Law &sect; 265-a(2), and ESSCB's donor compensation program did not, as petitioners argued, improperly make grant funds available for such cloning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Citizen Taxpayer Standing -- Challenge to Administration of Stem Cell Research Grants -- Egg Donor Compensation Program </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The individual petitioners, members of the board of directors of the organizational petitioner, lacked standing as citizen taxpayers to challenge a resolution adopted by respondent Empire State Stem Cell Board (ESSCB), an agency created by the Legislature to administer the Empire State Stem Cell Trust Fund, to include in future grants to stem cell researchers a clause permitting researchers to compensate oocyte donors on the ground that the resolution failed to provide for fully informed consent. State Finance Law &sect; 123-b, under which a citizen taxpayer may seek equitable or declaratory relief based on a wrongful expenditure of state funds, is narrowly construed and does not cover challenges to an agency's alleged mismanagement of state funds or the arbitrary and capricious distribution of state funds. Here, petitioners asserted that the informed consent standards developed byESSCB's ethics committee were inadequate to ensure that the consent of compensated donors would be truly voluntary. This was a challenge to the manner in which the donor compensation program was conducted, rather than to the ESSCB's authority to conduct it. As such, it was not the kind of challenge for which State Finance Law &sect; 123-b confers standing. Further, petitioners did not have common-law taxpayer standing, which permits taxpayers to challenge certain governmental actions when the failure to accord such standing would erect an impenetrable barrier to judicial scrutiny. No such impenetrable barrier existed here, since no showing was made that an oocyte donor would be unable to challenge the procedures used to obtain her informed consent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Construction -- Stem Cell Research Grants - Definition of &quot;Human Reproductive Cloning&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent Empire State Stem Cell Board's (ESSCB) interpretation of the term &quot;human reproductive cloning,&quot; which is prohibited by Public Health Law &sect; 265-a (2), as meaning an attempt to establish a pregnancy or the birth of a human child by transferring a human embryo created by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) into a woman's uterus, and not including &quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; in which SCNT is used to produce stem cells for research or therapeutic purposes, was not unreasonable or irrational. Since the Legislature did not provide a statutory definition of the phrase &quot;human reproductive cloning&quot; and its meaning is not commonly understood, ESSCB's administrative expertise in interpreting that technical term was entitled to deference.ESSCB's interpretation was well-established in the scientific community and in scientific literature, and consistent with stem cell research legislation defining &quot;human reproductive cloning&quot; in other states. Moreover, nothing in the Stem Cell Act or the record indicated that the Legislature intended the phrase &quot;human reproductive cloning&quot; to prohibit funding any stem cell research involving SCNT.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Construction -- Stem Cell Research Grants -- Scope of Prohibition against Human Reproductive Cloning Research </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In authorizing the Empire State Stem Cell Trust Fund to compensate donors of oocytes that might be used to create stem cells using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), respondent Empire State Stem Cell Board (ESSCB) did not violate Public Health Law &sect; 265-a (2), which provides that &quot;[n]o grants made available in the fund from any source shall be directly or indirectly utilized for research involving human reproductive cloning,&quot; because knowledge derived from SCNT research could be indirectly utilized for research involving human reproductive cloning. As the statute is written, the adverb &quot;indirectly&quot; applies to the utilization of grants, not to the utilization of research results. Thus, the indirect use of grants for research involving human reproductive cloning does not equate with the use of state-funded research results by subsequent researchers who themselves receive no ESSCB funding. Further, a prohibition against funding any research that might indirectly advance human reproductive cloning would effectively include a broad range of stem cell research, contravening the legislative authorization to ESSCB &quot;to make grants to ... activities that will advance scientific discoveries in fields related to stem cell biology&quot; (Public Health Law &sect; 265-a [1]). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, Civil Service Law &sect; 75-b did not apply separately to individual public employees where the pertinent governmental entity was also sued. Therefore, the trial court did not err in dismissing the individuals named in the employee's claim because he sued them in their official capacities. However, the trial court erred in dismissing the employee's claim under &sect; 75-b and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging that his U.S. Const. amend. I rights were violated because he was terminated for speaking with the police and other investigators regarding a patient's death. The trial court erred in holding that Labor Law &sect; 740(7), the election of remedies provision, barred the claim. Section 740(7), which was incorporated into actions against public employers under Civil Service Law &sect; 75-b(3)(c), did not extend to exclude a potential 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action commenced pursuant to the public employee whistleblower statute (Civil Service Law &sect; 75-b), plaintiff employee's 42 USC &sect; 983 cause of action based on his claim that his employment with defendant Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities was terminated because he spoke with police, the Office of the Inspector General and a patient's family regarding the patient's death, which allegedly resulted from improper actions by said defendant's employees, was improperly dismissed as being barred by the election of remedies provision of Labor Law &sect; 740 (7). Section 740 (7), which addresses private employers, provides that an action instituted in accordance with section 740 is deemed a waiver of the rights and remedies available under any other contract, collective bargaining agreement, law, rule or regulation or under the common law, and is incorporated into actions against public employers under Civil Service Law &sect; 75-b (3) (c). However, private employers are not susceptible to section 1983 claims as they do not typically engage in state action. Thus, a statutory exception for potential actions against a private employer would not include section 1983, and a statute applicable to public employers that borrows the exception for private employers with no expansion or clarification should not be extended to encompass a section 1983 action absent clear legislative guidance.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first prosecution for a crime of terrorism under &sect; 490.25, a provision of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, L 2001, ch. 300, defendant was charged with specified offenses as crimes of terrorism following a fight among rival gang members. The State alleged that defendant acted with intent to further the alleged purpose of the gang to intimidate or coerce a civilian population. It further claimed that individuals of a particular ethnicity living in a particular urban neighborhood constituted a &quot;civilian population&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 490.25(1). However, the evidence was not legally sufficient to establish that defendant acted with the requisite intent to render his offenses crimes of terrorism. Even assuming in the State's favor that the Mexican-American residents of the area could have constituted a &quot;civilian population,&quot; which it did not, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that defendant committed the crimes with the intent to intimidate or coerce that civilian population generally, as opposed to the much more limited category of members of rival gangs. Accordingly, defendant's crime of terror convictions were reduced to the lesser included offenses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a prosecution arising out of defendant's shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl, the evidence was not legally sufficient to establish that defendant acted with the requisite intent to render his offenses crimes of terrorism. Even assuming that residents of a certain ethnicity in a particular area constituted &quot;a civilian population&quot; under Penal Law &sect; 490.25 (1), the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that defendant committed his crimes with the intent to intimidate or coerce that &quot;civilian population&quot; generally, as opposed to the much more limited category of members of rival gangs. The only purposes of defendant's actions were those of asserting his gang's dominance over rival gangs in general and pursuing a vendetta against a particular rival gang. While defendant's gang sometimes preyed on area residents who were not gang members, there was nothing to suggest that defendant's actions were motivated by the desire to intimidate a particular ethnic community in a certain geographic area. The crime of terrorism is not established unless the alleged terroristic intent is connected to the particular specified offense underlying the charge, and the &quot;civilian population&quot; to be intimidated must be some group other than the direct victims of the crime.  </SPAN></P>

In a prosecution arising out of defendant's shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl, the evidence was not legally sufficient to establish that defendant acted with the requisite intent to render his offenses crimes of terrorism. Members of other rival gangs in the area in which defendant's gang operated did not qualify as &quot;a civilian population&quot; within the meaning of Penal Law &sect; 490.25 (1). The context of the Anti-Terrorism Act weighs against stretching the meaning of its language to cover such a narrowly defined subcategory of individuals. Rather, the Legislature intended to address extraordinary criminal acts perpetrated for the purpose of intimidating a broad range of people, not a narrowly defined group of particular individuals whom the criminal actor happens to regard as adversaries. A minimum size of &quot;a civilian population&quot; need not be defined where the legislative findings implied an intent to create a pervasively terrorizing effect on people living in a given area, directed either to all of those residents or those residents who are members of some broadly defined class, such as a gender, race, nationality, ethnicity or religion.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the prosecution of defendant arising from his shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl, the trial evidence was sufficient to support the judgment convicting him of attempted murder, manslaughter and weapon possession, and conspiracy to commit first-degree assault as lesser included offenses underlying terrorism charges based on the testimony of an accomplice who was a leader of defendant's gang, because that testimony found support in &quot;corroborative evidence tending to connect the defendant with the commission of [the] offense[s]&quot; (CPL 60.22 [1]). The chief corroborating evidence was the statements defendant gave to the police in which he admitted his membership in the gang, placed himself at the scene of the crime and admitted having held a gun there.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a prosecution for terrorism arising out of defendant's shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl, defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by the manner in which the court referred to the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 (9/11). While it would have been preferable for the court to forgo the reference to jury service as a way to &quot;speak back&quot; to the 9/11 terrorists, it was highly unlikely that the jurors misinterpreted that hortatory rhetoric as an invitation to vindicate their own rage at the 9/11 terrorists by their treatment of defendant's case, thereby undermining the impartiality of the proceedings. Nothing in the court's remarks likened defendant to the 9/11 terrorists; on the contrary, the court specifically explained that defendant was not being charged with politically motivated terrorism. Significantly, the trial took place a full six years after 9/11, and defendant did not claim that anything the jurors learned of his background might have caused them to connect him to the 9/11 terrorists. Further, given the vast scale of the 9/11 catastrophe, the distinction between those attacks and the crimes charged was unmistakable.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Defendant was not entitled to a new trial in the interest of justice based on the introduction of numerous hearsay statements at his trial on charges stemming from his shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl. Defendant not only failed to raise any objections, but also affirmatively waived them and sought to use the evidence in question for his own strategic ends. Accordingly, defendant, through counsel, intelligently and knowingly waived his Confrontation Clause claims.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Effective Representation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a prosecution for terrorism arising out of defendant's shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl, the performance of defendant's lead trial counsel was not so deficient as to deny him effective assistance of counsel. In the absence of a complete record developed by a motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to CPL 440.10, it may be presumed that counsel exercised professional judgment and strategic discretion in determining how to conduct the defense. The existing record reflected that counsel followed a coherent strategy that sought to show that defendant committed no crime beyond weapon possession, a charge that he was unlikely to defeat given the denial of his suppression motion. Further, counsel competently attacked the credibility of the People's main witness, and brought out the inconsistencies between his testimony and that of other witnesses. Ultimately, counsel obtained an acquittal on the second-degree murder charge, the most serious count of the indictment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Review -- Inconsistent Verdict</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In a prosecution for terrorism arising out of defendant's shooting of a supposed rival gang member and a 10-year-old girl, defendant's claim that the verdict was irreconcilably inconsistent insofar as he was convicted of attempted second-degree murder with respect to the supposed rival gang member who was paralyzed, while he was acquitted of the second-degree murder charge with respect to the girl who was killed, was unpreserved as defendant failed to raise it before the jury was discharged. The failure to object to the verdict as inconsistent at the appropriate time may well have been a conscious tactical choice by defense counsel, since resubmitting the case to the jury to cure the inconsistency could have resulted in the acquittal on the murder charge being changed to a conviction. Accordingly, the claim was not reviewed in the interest of justice.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confession -- Noncustodial Statements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In a criminal prosecution, defendant's motion to suppress statements he made to the police was correctly denied. The police did not act improperly in entering defendant's apartment when they first approached him for questioning, since they entered the apartment with the implicit consent of an elderly man (apparently, defendant's stepfather) who met them at the door. The police did not have to give defendant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings when they began to interview him after he voluntarily accompanied them to the precinct, since a reasonable innocent person in defendant's situation would have believed, at the inception of the interview, that the police, who never displayed their weapons, were still in the process of gathering information about the alleged incident. Accordingly, the suppression court properly concluded that defendant was not in custody when the interview began and that the police were not required to read the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings at that point. </SPAN></P>
