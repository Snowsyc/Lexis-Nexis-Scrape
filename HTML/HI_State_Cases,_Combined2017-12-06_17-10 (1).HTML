</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court of crimes including attempted murder, terroristic threatening, escape, theft, place to keep pistol or revolver, and unauthorized entry into a motor vehicle. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (Hawai'i) vacated the trial court's judgment and remanded for a new trial. The prosecution's petition for writ of certiorari to review this judgment was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution introduced defendant's toxicology screen at his trial, over his objection. The supreme court held the screen was an inadmissible privileged physician-patient communication under Haw. R. Evid. 504, absent defendant's waiver. Admitting the evidence was not harmless, if error, as it went to defendant's credibility and state of mind. It was improper for the supreme court to take judicial notice, under Haw. R. Evid. 201, of documents not in the record, on the waiver question, under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 641-2 (1993). Defense counsel's statement did not satisfy Haw. R. Evid. 511, as to waiver, because it did not prove the screen's disclosure, nor that disclosure was voluntary. The prosecution's waiver argument, not raised at trial, could be considered, as the trial court found the screen was not privileged, so the prosecution did not need to argue waiver at trial. On remand, the trial court had to find: (1) if defendant's counsel gave the screen to the prosecution; and (2) if the report was given to the prosecution, whether defendant voluntarily disclosed or consented to its disclosure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Intermediate Court of Appeals' remand for new trial was vacated, its vacation of the trial court's judgment as to seven counts was affirmed, and its affirmance as to one count was affirmed. The matter was remanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on waiver. If waiver was not found, a new trial was to be held; if waiver was found, a new judgment reinstating defendant's convictions was to enter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of a decision from the First Circuit Court (Hawaii), which found in favor of appellees, the Chairman of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR), the District Manager of DLNR's Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation, the Harbor Agent of Ala Wai Small Boat Harbor, and the Hearing Officer of the DLNR. The issues surrounded the fees and costs related to impoundment of the corporation's vessel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation contended that the circuit court erred in concluding that the corporation was appealing the hearing officer's decision pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 91-14 (1993) and not bringing an action pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 91-7 or 91-8 (1993). The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment, stating that the record did not reflect that the corporation petitioned the DLNR for a declaratory order as to the applicability of any statutory provision or of any rule or order of the agency pursuant to &sect; 91-7 and that the corporation did not petition the circuit court for a judicial declaration as to the validity of an agency rule pursuant &sect; 91-8. Additionally, the court disagreed with the corporation's contention that the setting of a release fee should be part of the post seizure administrative hearing process and that the DLNR should have promulgated rules pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 200-16 (1994) regarding the amount that the DLNR could spend to impound a vessel. The court held that the rules mandated by &sect; 200-16 to implement the requirement for the post-seizure administrative hearing process did not include rules regarding the amounts that could be spent on impoundment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i) entered judgment convicting defendant of place to keep a pistol or revolver, ownership or possession prohibited of any firearm or ammunition by a person convicted of certain crimes, promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree, and promoting unlawful use of drug paraphernalia. Defendant appealed, claiming in part that the circuit court should have given a merger instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man were arrested after a gun was found under a car passenger seat where defendant had been sitting and a subsequent pat-down revealed drug paraphernalia on defendant. Defendant claimed that the trial court plainly erred by failing to give the jury an instruction under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 701-109(1)(e) (1993) on the possible merger of the firearms charges under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134-6(c), (e) (Supp. 2000) and Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134-7(b), (h) (Supp. 2000). The court agreed. Possession of a firearm was a necessary element of both firearms charges, which arose from a single event. To be convicted of both charges the jury would have had to find that defendant had an intent to carry or possess a firearm for the first count and a separate intent to possess or control a handgun for the second count. Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 701-109(1)(e) (1993) applied because the same evidence was used to show the requisite intent to possess for each count. The court held that the failure to give a merger instruction was prejudicially insufficient because the question of whether defendant's conduct constituted separate and distinct culpable acts was one of fact for the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the circuit court's judgment of conviction and sentence with respect to the firearms counts and remanded the matter to the circuit court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court for the First Circuit (Hawai'i) his conviction of habitually driving under the influence (DUI) of intoxicating liquor, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 291-4.4 (Supp. 2000) (repealed 2002), arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the habitual DUI charge after he showed that three of the predicate DUI convictions were constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that three of defendant's prior DUI convictions entered in the relevant time period were constitutionally invalid and obtained in violation of Haw. R. Penal P. 11. The prosecution, relying on court precedent, conceded that dismissal of the habitual DUI charge was appropriate; however, the prosecution's reliance was flawed, and the concession was not binding on the appellate court. In the other case, the prior conviction had been vacated, and, insofar as none of the prior convictions in the case at bar were vacated, the prior case was not controlling. The court interpreted &quot;conviction,&quot; as used in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 291-4.4 (Supp. 2000) (repealed 2002), to mean any judgment or plea that had not been expunged by pardon, reversed, or set aside at the time a defendant was found guilty of the habitual DUI charge. The court held that a defendant could not collaterally attack prior counseled DUI convictions on the basis that they were obtained as the result of allegedly invalid guilty pleas. Such challenges had to be raised either through a direct appeal or pursuant to Haw. R. Penal P. 40 for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's judgment of conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by appellant associate professor against appellees, a university and its officials, alleging, inter alia, sexual harassment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000(e) et seq., the First Circuit Court, Hawai'i, entered a final judgment in favor of the university.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The associate professor, who had been denied promotion to full professor in the university's engineering college, argued that the trial court erred in: (1) denying her motion to compel discovery; (2) granting defendants' motion to exclude evidence regarding the performance of the persons who reviewed her promotion application; and (3) granting defendants' oral motion to direct a verdict on the associate professor's claim for emotional distress. The instant court concluded that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to compel discovery without prejudice and providing the associate professor an opportunity to tailor her discovery request or refile her motion. The circuit court also properly granted defendants' motion in limine. The circuit court erred in directing a verdict as to the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, the error was harmless, inasmuch as the jury expressly found for defendants regarding the associate professor's other claims, all of which turned on formulations entailing thresholds less stringent than the &quot;outrageous conduct&quot; standard requisite to an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 660-3 (1993), claiming that the family court had not been presented with any evidence on which to base a probable cause finding to support their continued detention. At a consolidated hearing on the petitions, the family court reviewed police reports, found bases for probable cause for the detentions, and denied the petitions. On appeal, the court dismissed the consolidated appeals, holding that the issue was moot. One minor had already been adjudicated a law violator and the petition had been dismissed as to the other minor. The court held that the issues involved were not a matter of public concern; hence, there was no exception to the mootness doctrine. Also, there was no need for an authoritative determination for future guidance because the family court's method of subsequently reviewing the record to determine bases for continued detention sufficed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A hostage stand-off between defendant and police was triggered during the execution of a warrant for defendant's arrest. The State's successful motion for extended terms of imprisonment, filed pursuant to &sect; 706-662(4)(a), claimed defendant was a &quot;multiple offender&quot; and that his criminality was so extensive that extended terms of imprisonment were necessary to protect the public. Defendant contended the bright-line rule adopted by the Apprendi Court--i.e., that any fact, other than a prior conviction, that increased the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt--superceded the instant court's analysis used to determine whether the sentencing court or jury could impose an extended term sentence. Defendant argued &sect; 706-662(4)(a) was unconstitutional as applied to him with respect to nine of the counts on which he was convicted. The instant court disagreed. The facts foundational to defendant's extended terms of imprisonment, pursuant to &sect; 706-662(4)(a), fell outside the Apprendi rule, and, thus, the multiple offender/protection of public determination was properly within the province of the sentencing court.</SPAN></P>

Appellees failed to respond, and a contested case hearing was scheduled for each complainant. The complainants intervened as parties. In a letter to the executive director, appellees demanded a jury trial as to all of the complainants' allegations, pursuant to Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Appellees then filed the complaint in this case. The instant court held that the complainants were estopped from attempting to enforce any arbitration agreements in the circuit court. Appellees were not entitled to opt out of the proceedings before the HCRC. Appellees were entitled to a jury trial with respect to the executive director's demand for $ 400,000 in general damages, payable to each of the complainants, based on their allegations of sex discrimination and retaliation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, the Third Circuit Court (Hawai'i) convicted defendant of manslaughter, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-702(1)(a) (1993), operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (DUI), Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2002), and driving without no-fault insurance, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431:10C-104 (Supp. 2002). Defendant's motion for a new trial was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged after he drove while intoxicated, hitting and killing a woman. He stipulated his intoxication and the cause of death at trial. The State's motion to allow evidence of Canadian convictions was granted in part to allow one incident at trial, but not the fact of conviction. After his conviction, defendant moved for a new trial, alleging prosecutorial misconduct regarding the State's questions as to defendant's intoxication in the Canadian incident relative to the Hawai'i incident. The motion was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentence. Under Haw. R. Evid. 401, the DUI incident underlying the Canadian conviction was relevant to defendant's awareness that his ability to control a vehicle was seriously impaired when he was intoxicated. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in balancing the interests under Haw. R. Evid. 403 and determining that the probative value outweighed any unfair prejudice. There was no prosecutorial misconduct, as State's questions about defendant's intoxication level in Canada were not prejudicial, but rather were calculated to show defendant's substantial and unjustifiable risk in driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial defendant asserted a defense of lack of penal responsibility. On appeal he argued inter alia he was denied a fair trial because the circuit court's jury instructions did not define the terms &quot;appreciate&quot; and &quot;wrongfulness&quot; as used in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 704-400(1). The appellate court found that both defense and prosecution experts testified to the meaning of the term &quot;appreciate,&quot; that none of the uses testified to were improper, that the ordinary meaning was not precise, and that it was the jury's function to listen to the judge's instructions and the testimony of the expert witnesses. Therefore, the lack of a specific definition of &quot;appreciate&quot; did not deny defendant a fair trial. Defendant also argued that &quot;wrongfulness&quot; should have been defined because it carried with it a moral distinction not reflected in the instructions provided to the jury. The court adopted a subjective/objective test, but held that even under the more liberal subjective test, that is, that the perpetrator appreciated that his conduct was criminal, but, because of a delusion, believed it to be morally justified, defendant had failed to adduce evidence sufficient to support such an instruction.</SPAN></P>

Shortly thereafter, defendant was stopped a few vehicles behind the complainant at a busy intersection.

After retrieving a long pole from his truck, defendant struck the complainant with the pole. The complainant suffered a deep laceration on his right cheek and permanent left shoulder damage. Defendant was charged with first-degree assault. At trial, defendant argued that he had attacked the complainant in an effort to defend the passenger. Defendant was found guilty as charged. On appeal, the court affirmed. In addition to the overwhelming evidence derived from the witnesses and medical evidence indicating that defendant did not act to defend the passenger, defendant's testimony was contradictory and inherently incredible. Comments by the prosecutor at trial were not reversible misconduct in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, negotiator and numerous Hawai'i State and local officials, appealed the judgment and order entered by the First Circuit Court, Hawai'i, in favor of plaintiffs, public employee unions, declaring unconstitutional 1999 Haw. Sess. Laws 100, &sect; 2, which prohibited the unions from collectively bargaining over cost items for the biennium 1999 to 2001 and permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing it. Plaintiffs cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted 1999 Haw. Sess. Laws 100, &sect; 2, which amended Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-9(a) (2001), prohibiting public employers and public employees' unions from collectively bargaining over cost items for the biennium 1999 to 2001. The plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants, alleging that 1999 Haw. Sess. Laws 100, &sect; 2, violated their right to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining, as provided by Haw. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2. The Hawai'i Supreme Court ruled that 1999 Haw. Sess. Laws 100, &sect; 2, violated the rights of public employees under Haw. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2. The intent and object of the framers who adopted former Haw. Const. art. XII, &sect; 2, renumbered to Haw. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 2, was to extend to public employees similar rights to collective bargaining previously adopted for private employees under Haw. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1. The Hawai'i Supreme Court rejected defendants' contention that the phrase &quot;as provided by law&quot; gave the legislature complete discretion to take away public employees' right to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining. Such reading was contrary to the underlying object and purpose of the constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was temporarily detained while the Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of Conservation and Resource Enforcement (DOCARE) investigated a complaint about defendant's use of gill nets. While detained, an officer asked defendant if he knew of the &quot;four-hour rule.&quot; The appellate court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the oral statement as evidence because: (1) defendant was lawfully subjected to a temporary detention, which was reasonable in order for the DOCARE to investigate a complaint; (2) the officer's question to defendant as to whether he knew the four-hour rule was general, brief, and non-coercive; and, (3) based on the totality of the circumstances, defendant failed to establish he was &quot;in custody&quot; to trigger Miranda warnings. The court also held that Haw. Admin. R. &sect; 13-75-12(a)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague as the plain language of the rule gave a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what act was prohibited so that he or she may act accordingly and provided explicit standards for those who enforced the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed suit in the First Circuit Court, Hawai'i, seeking to enjoin defendants, the City and the County of Honolulu (county), from assessing and collecting real property tax on real properties leased to the State. The circuit court denied the State's motions for preliminary injunction and for partial summary judgment and granted summary judgment and final judgment in favor of the County. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted on appeal that the constitutional rule of tax immunity (CRTI) prohibited the County's taxation of real property leased by the State. The court declined, however, to hold that Honolulu County, Haw., Ordinance 95-67 (July 1, 1996), repealing the exemption under Haw., Rev. Ordinances &sect; 8-10.17(b) (1990) (repealed), was void under the CRTI, finding instead that the CRTI did not apply where only one constitution was at issue, the State's, and that under that authority the Counties, and not the State, were supreme with respect to the power to tax real property. The court also rejected the State's argument that the County was generally precluded under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 246-36(2) (1993) from taxing the State's leaseholds, holding that the statute was no longer controlling in light of the County's enactment of Honolulu County, Haw., Ordinance 95-67 (July 1, 1996), as well as the State's argument that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 246A-2(2) (Supp. 1996) exempted it from an obligation to pay the real property taxes assessed against State-leased property, holding that &sect; 246A-2(2) lapsed by its own terms and by the terms of Haw. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 6 (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both the circuit court's order denying the State's motion for partial summary judgment and granting summary judgment to the County, as well as the circuit court's final judgment entered in favor of the County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of carrying or use of firearm in the commission of a separate felony and second degree murder, the separate felony in the former offense. Subsequently, the state supreme court decided State v. Jumila, 87 Hawai'i 1, 950 P.2d 1201 (1998) and held that a defendant could not be convicted of both Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134-6(a) and the separate felony. Defendant timely appealed his conviction. In 1999, the legislature amended Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134-6(e) and explicitly stated a defendant could be convicted of both Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134-6(a) and the separate felony. The appellate court considered the legislative history supporting the amendment to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134-6(e) and overruled its decision in Jumila that a defendant could not be convicted of both Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134-6(a) and the separate felony, except of course, as provided in the statute itself. The appellate court noted that the legislative history reflected an intent to allow dual convictions for all offenses other than those listed in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 134-6(a)(1)-(4). As second degree murder was not within the numerated subsections, defendant was properly convicted of both offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the officer stopped the vehicle and approached it to check the driver's impairment, he recognized both the driver and passenger.

The appellate court agreed Miranda warnings were not mandated, as police did not possess probable cause to arrest the driver. It also concluded the officer's temporary detention of the driver was lawful, because it was supported by reasonable suspicion that she was driving while impaired. However, because the circuit court failed to make appropriate findings and conclusions regarding the voluntariness of her consent to search, it vacated the circuit court's suppression order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee of a hotel corporation settled an arbitration claim against the corporation's CEO. The circuit court affirmed the award. On review, the CEO argued the arbitration panel exceeded its authority when it: (1) failed to follow Hawai'i law; (2) failed to enforce the fully integrated settlement agreement; (3) awarded legally inconsistent remedies; and (4) refused to hear evidence on how the award would unjustly enrich the hotel employee. The state supreme court reviewed the matter and found no error. Judicial review of arbitration awards, pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 659-9 (4)(1993), did not encompass the effects of choice-of-law restrictions in the underlying contract on arbitral authority unless so delineated in the arbitration clause. The circuit court did not err when it confirmed the award.

The court granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence was discovered after a stop of the vehicle defendant was a passenger in and a subsequent dog sniff search. The dog jumped into the truck and alerted on items in the cab. The State argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by granting defendant's motion to suppress because defendant, as a passenger who did not own the truck, did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the truck. The supreme court agreed. Defendant did not carry his burden of establishing that the canine screening or the subsequent search of the vehicle in which he was a mere passenger infringed upon a legitimate expectation of privacy that he held in the areas searched. Indeed, he never claimed that, during the relevant period, he even held such an actual, subjective expectation, much less one that society would have regarded as being objectively reasonable. As such, defendant did not establish that the protections afforded to him by the Fourth Amendment were violated. Accordingly, because the dog leaped into the vehicle, the trial court erred in concluding that the items seized in executing the search warrant upon the vehicle were inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

Defendant presented a state identification card in response to the police officer's request for identification. The police officer requested a warrant checking using his shoulder mounted radio because defendant was in a high drug activity area and had started to act funny. Within a few minutes it was confirmed that defendant had outstanding warrants so the police officer began to pat down defendant incident to the arrest for outstanding warrants. The police officer found crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia on defendant's person. Defendant alleged that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 291C-164 (1993) prohibited a police officer from requesting warrant checks in traffic violation stops. The appellate court held that the act of calling in a warrant check during a traffic violation stop was not statutorily prohibited and did not amount to an unconstitutional search or seizure. Thus, an officer was not prohibited from requesting a warrant check incident to the issuance of a citation for a traffic violation when the check did not prolong the length of time needed to issue a citation.</SPAN></P>

The city cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees owned fee simple title to the land underlying two residential condominium developments. The City of Honolulu condemned some of the trustees' land underlying the condominium developments pursuant to Honolulu, Haw., Rev. Ordinances ch. 38 (1991). The trustees filed a complaint alleging the trust property was outside the scope of the ordinance. The circuit court properly denied their motions for summary judgment. The purpose section of the ordinance expressed the ambitious goal of providing any person with a share in fee simple land. The benefits of ch. 38 extended to owner-occupants who elected to structure the title to their assets in a trust. However, the trustees were entitled to out-of-pocket expenses, because the city failed to proceed with condemnation of the trustees' property within the twelve months mandated by the ordinance. The circuit court misconstrued Honolulu, Haw., Rev. Ordinances &sect; 38-2.2 (1991), in determining the minimum number of applicants required to initiate the lease-to-fee conversion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

He also contended that his trial counsel provided him with ineffective assistance. The instant court held that the firearms and defendant's statement constituted &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree,&quot; because, but for the exploitation by the police of a prior illegality - i.e., the execution of the unlawfully obtained search warrant, the police would not have learned of the firearms, obtained defendant's father's consent to search the tool shed, discovered the firearms, questioned defendant about the firearms, and obtained defendant's statement confessing that he had possessed the firearms. Thus, the trial court erred in failing to suppress the firearms.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellee State argued that the First Circuit Court (Hawai'i) erred when it granted respondent defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained by the police during the search of defendant's home. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police went to one defendant's home to execute a valid search warrant. The police decided to use a ruse to enter the home and had two plain-clothed undercover female officers knock on the door and call out defendant's name. When defendant started to open the door, the undercover officers jumped out of the way so the search team could gain access to the home. Defendant opened the door 8 to 12 inches then quickly attempted to shut the door when he felt someone begin to push the door open. When defendant started to shut the door, members of the search team yelled &quot;Police! Search Warrant!&quot; and used bodily force to open the door. No officer expressly demanded entry into the residence to execute the warrant. The appellate court noted that, under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 803-37, the &quot;knock and announce&quot; rule was triggered where a ruse was accompanied by the use of force to gain entry into a home during the execution of a search warrant. As the use of one officer's arm and body weight was sufficient to constitute necessary force, the officers' failure to demand entrance into defendant's home once force was used constituted an unlawful breaking.</SPAN></P>

The court held that denial of the pretrial motion to dismiss was proper because the statute was not vague in that it clearly identified the requisite mental states corresponding to each element of the offense, such that gave a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what was prohibited and provided explicit standards for those who apply the statute.

Inasmuch as the provisions of the temporary restraining order in this case were not modified or set aside, the factual basis for the temporary restraining order was not subject to collateral attack at the criminal trial charging defendant with violation of the temporary restraining order. The family court, therefore, correctly applied the temporary restraining order provision prohibiting defendant from contacting the woman based on the evidence before it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case involving a dispute over revenues owed to the appellee Board of Trustees to the Office of Hawai'i Affairs (OHA's) under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-13.5 (1993), appellant, the State of Hawaii, brought an interlocutory appeal from the orders of the First Circuit Court (Hawai'i) denying the State's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; and (2) granting OHA's motions for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) sought its pro rata share of airport revenue under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 10-2, 10-13.5, as amended by Act 304. The State contended that federal law, specifically, the Forgiveness Act, prohibited the payment of airport revenue to OHA. At first glance, no conflict between the Forgiveness Act and the application of Act 304 was readily apparent. However, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-13.5, as amended by Act 304, provided for payment of twenty percent of all revenue derived from ceded lands to OHA. Because the airport sat, at least partially, on federal lands, federal law applied. Specifically, as applied to the airport revenue sought in this case, Act 304 conflicted with the provisions of the Forgiveness Act. As such, by its own terms, Act 304 was invalid. Without Act 304, the appellate court had no way of determining whether OHA was entitled to the specific revenues sought in this suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was appointed to represent a criminal defendant's appeal.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 802-5 (1993) was a judicial act and was subject to review. The lower court abused its discretion in granting defendant compensation for only 7.3 of the 35.3 hours requested. However, the overall quality of the documents filed by defendant on behalf of his client was inconsistent with the amount of time he claimed to have spent in researching and drafting them. Given the record in this case, it would have been patently unreasonable to grant the attorney the full number of hours requested. The attorney demonstrated that 15.35 hours was reasonable compensation for the services he performed.</SPAN></P>

Nor was the defendant unconstitutionally &quot;seized&quot; during the questioning because the questioning was not a focused and intrusive quest for criminal wrongdoing, and the questioning was general information gathering and not designed to elicit responses that would either vindicate or implicate the defendant in the murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff university faculty members sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the First Circuit Court (Hawai'i). The circuit court concluded that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-37 applied, and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, director of finance and governor. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought suit alleging that a loss of $ 6 million from the state university's budget had a negative effect on its operations, ultimately affecting all of its employees. Defendants claimed the plaintiffs lacked standing to assert the claims for relief at issue. The standing inquiry focused on whether plaintiffs suffered an injury in fact. The court found that plaintiffs failed to allege that they had personally suffered any distinct and palpable injury. Because a special interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit was insufficient to invoke judicial intervention, plaintiffs were without standing. Plaintiffs did not show a deterioration in their working conditions or any other detriment, actual or threatened, as a result of the defendants' actions. Plaintiffs' asserted injury was abstract, conjectural, or merely hypothetical.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court's judgment was vacated and the case was remanded for dismissal based on a lack of jurisdiction. Plaintiffs lacked standing to assert their claims for relief. They failed to demonstrate that they suffered an injury to a recognized interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a slip-and-fall case, appellant claimed the First Circuit Court (Hawai'i) erred by concluding that she was not a prevailing party at trial, following the parties' involvement in the Court-Annexed Arbitration Program.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's claim against appellee went to arbitration. Appellee then challenged the arbitration award. The jury entered a verdict in favor of appellant that was less than the arbitration award. The trial court ruled that Haw. Cir. Ct. R. 25(B) superseded Haw. R. Civ. P. 54(d), and therefore appellee was the prevailing party. The trial court properly rejected appellant's argument that the total amount of her amended final judgment, including prejudgment interest, should be used in determining who was the prevailing party. Appellee was the prevailing party in the trial because he secured a 30 percent reduction in the arbitration award. Although appellant may have prevailed in the traditional sense, she was not the prevailing party according to the rules of court because Haw. Cir. Ct. R. 25 superseded any common law prevailing party determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Male and female defendants appealed a judgment of the Fifth Circuit Court (Hawai'i), which convicted them of one count of kidnapping and one count of second degree murder.

According to female defendant, the phrase &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity&quot; did not provide adequate notice of the conduct which was prohibited. The instant court concluded that &sect; 706-657 was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute provided adequate guidance to a factfinder charged with determining whether a murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity. However, because the instant court held that the Young standard applied retroactively, it vacated defendants' enhanced sentences for murder and remanded the case for &sect; 706-657 hearings to be conducted in accordance with the Young standard. Defendants could not be subjected to an enhanced sentence unless they were resentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole after a jury found that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel according to the Young standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 16 years-old at the time of his arrest and originally charged as a minor.

The court affirmed. The court ruled that &sect; 571-22 was not unconstitutional, because, inter alia, Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 did not require the family court to make a probable cause determination before waiving jurisdiction. Additionally, the factors enumerated in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571-22(c) (Supp. 1997), which the family court was not required to consider under &sect; 571-22(d), did not constitute minimum standards of due process and fairness.

Respondent, who was convicted of third degree assault, argued the special counsel's conflict of interest rendered his representation of respondent ineffective. The appellate court determined that a conflict of interest existed and that the record did not reflect respondent's consent after full consultation to the special counsel's hiring. The court concluded that respondent failed to establish that his relationship with the special counsel gave rise to a conflict of interest. Respondent was aware of the fact that a third party, the county, would hire the special counsel and pay his attorney's fees. There was no interference with the special counsel's independence of professional judgment or with the attorney-client relationship.</SPAN></P>

At sentencing on the revocation of his probation, he was given credit for pre-trial confinement in connection with the drug offenses, nunc pro tunc to the date of his arrest on the drug offenses. The prosecution appealed this sentence. The statute which required that a defendant be given credit, at sentencing, for pre-trial confinement, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-671(1) (1993), did not authorize the crediting of this pre-trial confinement to defendant's sentence for an unrelated crime, and, therefore, a sentence which applied such a credit was an illegal sentence. It was not apparent that the trial court intended to resentence defendant from his sentencing on the earlier offenses but delay mittimus until his arrest on the later offenses. The appellate court's opinion did not unconstitutionally penalize defendant for asserting his right to trial on the later offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed the judgment of the District Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i) affirming the lifetime revocation of his driver's license by respondent, pursuant to the Hawai'i Administrative Driver's License Revocation Act, Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 286, pt. XIV (1993 &amp; Supp. 1999). The lifetime revocation was predicated on petitioner's 3 prior convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol in the past 10 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent revoked petitioner's driver's license for life, under the Hawai'i Administrative Driver's License Revocation Act (Act), Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 286, pt. XIV (1993 &amp; Supp. 1999), due to 3 prior convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol in the past 10 years. Petitioner filed a petition for judicial review. The district court affirmed the revocation. Petitioner appealed, arguing that: (1) his continuance motion was improperly denied because a motion to set aside his guilty plea, challenging the validity of one of his prior convictions, was pending in the district court; and (2) one of his prior convictions was set aside after respondent's decision. The state supreme court held, first, that the denial of the continuance motion was proper because respondent considered the evidence before it at the time of the hearing and imposed the statutorily mandated revocation period. Second, despite the Act's provisions limiting judicial review, the state supreme court had the inherent power to require that petitioner be given the opportunity to challenge the revocation because one of his prior convictions had been set aside.

The court also denied appellant's motion because appellant could not assert correlative rights to the ground water because, absent the requisite land use approvals, it had not established a need for reasonable use of such water in connection with the overlying land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, trustees of a state office created to administer programs for the benefit of native Hawaiians, and respondent state governor brought an original action, asking the court whether the United States Supreme Court's Rice ruling operated to create vacancies on the board of trustees. The Rice decision stated that restrictions on Hawaiians' right to vote for trustees pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13D-3 were race-based and therefore invalid under U.S. Const. amend. XV. However, there was no decision as to whether the sitting trustees continued to have power to act. The court agreed with respondent's contention that the trustees became de facto trustees as a result of the Rice standard, but concluded that this did not automatically create vacancies under either Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13D-5 or 17-7. The statutes set forth only the procedure to follow when a vacancy occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the Supreme Court's recent decision did not mean that the elections of the eight sitting trustees were invalid, because there was no express judicial determination to that effect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of the decision and order of appellee Commission on Water Resource Management (Hawai'i), following a contested hearing on water use permit applications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal arose from an extended dispute over the water distributed by a major irrigation infrastructure on the island of Oahu, Hawai'i, supplying the island's leeward side with water diverted from its windward side. In a contested hearing, appellee Commission on Water Resource Management considered water use permit applications for various leeward offstream purposes and water reservation petitions for both instream and offstream uses. Appellants, the City of Honolulu, Hawai'i and various interested parties, sought review of appellee's decision. The court affirmed in part and vacated in part. The court held that the governor's public remarks regarding the matter did not prove that appellee could not have proceeded in a manner of independent judgment. The State Water Code, Haw. Rev. Stat. ch. 174C, did not supplant the public trust doctrine. Further, appellee did not abuse its discretion in pursuing the case-by-case evolution of water use policy through prior adjudicative proceedings. However, appellee erred by failing to consider the impact of fluctuating diversion on instream base flows and the practicability of adopting specific measures to mitigate this impact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. In considering the permit applications, appellee Commission on Water Resource Management did not err in accommodating existing agricultural uses while restoring instream flows. On remand, appellee needed to determine the validity of allocations in relation to instream requirements and availability of reclaimed water.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that trial court erred in finding him penally responsible; failing to convict him of manslaughter instead of second degree murder; denying his motion to dismiss the complaint, or in the alternative, to strike the enhanced sentencing language from the complaint; and sentencing him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant waived argument of penal irresponsibility by reason of pathological intoxication, but even if this issue had been properly preserved for appeal, evidence established that defendant's long-term, voluntary polysubstance abuse did not meet the statutory definition of pathological intoxication, and trial court did not err in refusing to convict defendant of manslaughter instead of murder. However, the court vacated defendant's enhanced sentence, because of an erroneous finding of fact; without this erroneous finding, there was not substantial evidence that defendant's attack was &quot;unnecessarily torturous&quot; to the victim, as required by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-657 (Supp. 1998); thus, trial court erred in imposing an enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On respondent's motion for an order to show cause, the trial court found that petitioners had not violated an injunction and denied petitioners attorney's fees. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in construing respondent's motion as one for civil contempt because it was functionally equivalent. The trial court's erroneous conclusion that its authority to sanction petitioners arose under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 710-1077 did not affect the outcome since the trial court had inherent authority to find civil contempt. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that petitioners had not committed civil contempt because respondent failed to produce sufficient evidence that petitioners' placement of gravel was not a diligent attempt to comply with the injunction or evidence that petitioners had removed the concrete curbing and boundary pins from respondent's property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Anonymously, appellant left items at church schools that appeared to be explosive devices, so police and bomb squads were summoned. Appellant, convicted of terroristic threatening, appealed. The court affirmed, holding that appellant's constitutional right to a unanimous verdict was not violated because Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 707-715(1) and (2) did not give rise to two separate and distinct crimes. The court recognized that although there was no single prosecutorial act that deprived appellant of a fair trial, the cumulative effect of the prosecutor's improper conduct could have been so prejudicial as to deny appellant a fair trial. However, because the trial court gave curative instructions to the jury, both before and after evidence was presented, any potential harm to appellant was remedied. Therefore, the court found that the prosecutor's improper statements and misstatements of law, alone or in combination, did not substantially prejudice appellant's right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 580-47(d) (2006); [2]-The sums paid by the father to the mother were calculated under the Child Support Guidelines based on the assumption that the parties would share physical custody, and these facts were sufficient to support the decision to modify the father's obligation, and the family court did not err in ordering the mother to reimburse the father for the child support payments she received between the filing date of the motion and the date of the hearing; [section 580-47(d) could not be used to modify the father's child support obligation prior to the date that the father filed his motion; because the father did not base his argument on Haw. R. Fam. Ct.  60(b), he was not entitled to relief under the rule.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 7, even though there was no evidence that the officer did not comply with state or federal flight regulations or used the aid of a sophisticated viewing device, as targeted aerial surveillance of a property was at odds with Hawai'i's constitutional protections of individual privacy, and the plants were located in the curtilage of defendant's home, which was less susceptible to warrantless &quot;open view&quot; searches.</SPAN></P>

Evid. 401, the circuit court did not err in excluding the testimony of defendant's expert witness that defendant was suffering from a psychosis caused by defendant's long-standing drug abuse as the expert's testimony was not relevant to establishing any defense based on a theory of pathological intoxication under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 702-230(5) because the fact that defendant suffered a drug-induced or exacerbated mental illness did not constitute a defense; and the expert did not know the amounts of the multiple drugs defendant ingested on the night in question, was reluctant to opine on whether defendant reaction to the ingested drugs was excessive in degree, and posited that the physical abnormality causing any excessive reaction was one caused by defendant's own long-standing drug abuse.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 708-810(1)(c) (2014), provided reasonable clarity as to what was proscribed and was not vague, and the circuit court thus did not rely on the wrong law in denying defendant's motions for acquittal; [2]-Defendant's motions for acquittal were properly denied because the fact that the residents of the home never gave him permission to enter the home, together with the evidence that he entered through an open window, disabled the alarm system by ripping wires out of the wall, opened dresser drawers in several bedrooms, and consumed juice from the refrigerator supported the jury's conclusion that, at a minimum, he intended to commit a crime while in the house.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 707-756 was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because when the statute was read as a whole it was clear that only criminal conduct was proscribed and it sufficiently identified the mens rea for each of the acts which together constituted the criminal offense. Even though the &quot;exceeds&quot; language in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 846E-1 was unconstitutionally vague, sexual assault in the first and third degrees were identified as covered offenses and were consistent with evidence of defendant's stated intent of having sexual relations with the girls, and the &quot;exceeds&quot; language was unnecessary to sustain a conviction against defendant; [2]-Section 707-756 did not concern interstate commerce and therefore scrutiny under the Commerce Clause was not appropriate; [3]-Section 707-756 did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 702-212(1) (1993) did not require it; [3]-Defendant's conviction had to be vacated because the offense's conduct element required proof he let his dogs become strays, and such proof was absent; [4]-It was no abuse of discretion to admit his prior violations because the State did not have to stipulate he owned the dogs and they ran at large off his property, and the prior incidents were relevant to prove motive, opportunity, and absence of mistake or accident, under Haw.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 89-13(a) (2012), and, while a trial court could hear the statutory claims, the primary jurisdiction doctrine required referral to the HLRB; [2]-dismissing the complaint erred because, when a matter was referred to an agency under the primary jurisdiction doctrine, dismissal was not proper unless the parties would not be unfairly disadvantaged, and a statute of limitations could bar refiling the union's claims if needed at the end of HLRB proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The proceedings in SP 09-1-0426 were ongoing to determine the inmate's claims. Because there was no final appealable order in either SPP 09-1-0026 or SP 09-1-0426, the appellate court lacked appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, individuals who contended that state housing development programs had been inadequately funded, sought review of a summary judgment from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i), which denied their request for declaratory and injunctive relief to require defendant state agencies and officials to seek further funding from the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the agencies and officials had not sought to obtain from the legislature sufficient sums for housing development pursuant to Haw. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1. The circuit court applied the political question doctrine in finding the claims nonjusticiable. The court concluded that the issue of whether sufficient sums had been provided was not a political question because the text of the constitutional provision did not give the legislature unreviewable discretion to determine sufficient sums and the history of the provision was a source of judicially discoverable and manageable standards with regard to the amount of sums that should be requested from the legislature. Moreover, the initial policy determination was made when the provision was enacted, and there was no lack of respect to the legislature in a court's addressing the question of sufficient sums. The case and question did not present an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made and did not create any potential for embarrassment from multifarious agency pronouncements. Accordingly, the issue of sufficient sums was justiciable and was not a political question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment and remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an owner of a large parcel that wholly surrounded appellee kuleana owner's property, sought review of orders from the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Hawai'i), which required the owner of the large parcel to record an easement in favor of the kuleana owner, to pay attorney fees and costs, to pay a sanction for failing to record an easement, and to permanently refrain from interfering with the kuleana owner's water system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispute involved water for two small parcels, or kuleanas, on which taro and other crops were grown. The kuleana owner had restored a traditional water system that brought water from a stream, crossing the large parcel, to his house and crops. Noting that the kuleana owner had first requested recordation in his written closing argument without citing authority, the court held that requiring recordation was error. Sufficient evidence supported findings of fact establishing that the kuleana owner had appurtenant water rights for domestic use in accordance with Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 7-1. The kuleana owner was not required under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 174C-3 (1993), &sect; 174C-91 (1993), 174C-92 (1993), 174C-93 (1993) to obtain a permit for his water system because Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 174C-101(d) (1993) exempted kuleana and taro lands; moreover, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 174C-48 (1993) exempted domestic use. A permanent injunction was proper and did not constitute a judicial taking. The circuit court provided no legal basis for awarding fees and costs under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 603-21.9 (1993) or its inherent power, and a sanction was improper because recordation should not have been required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the portions of the judgment that contained the order to record an easement and the order to pay attorney fees and costs, and remanded for further proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit of Hawai'i that convicted him, pursuant to a no-contest plea, of manslaughter under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-702(1)(a) (1993), for recklessly causing the death in a motor vehicle collision, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his plea because his plea was not knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest of a charge of manslaughter, relying upon counsel's advice that he could withdraw his plea at any time before sentencing. After the trial court denied defendant's motion to withdraw his plea and sentenced defendant to 20 years in prison, defendant sought review. On review, the court rejected defendant's claim that his plea was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered because the record established that he erroneously believed that he could withdraw his plea at any time before sentencing. At the hearing on defendant's motion, counsel testified that he explained the implications of defendant's no-contest plea and never advised defendant that he would be able to withdraw his plea at any time before sentencing. Because the district court found counsel's rendition of the facts to be more credible than that of defendant and because the court deferred to the trial court's resolution of credibility issues, the denial of defendant's motion to withdraw his no-contest plea was not shown to be error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus by a federal court, defendant's original sentence was invalidated. His status, in essence, reverted to that of an unsentenced felon. The circuit court was not limited to correcting the sentence under Haw. R. Penal P. 35 because the sentence on the extended-term counts was invalidated in its entirety. Pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 603-21.5(a)(1) (2004), the circuit court had plenary jurisdiction to resentence defendant de novo. Also, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for disqualification because the record did not support his assertion that the granting of the continuances created a reasonable perception that it was assisting the State in securing extended sentences because the State's motion for an extended sentence was denied and the circuit court was within its discretion to grant the continuances as defendant was unavailable for those resentencing hearings. Because the maximum length of imprisonment for each count was five years under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-660 (1993), the two-and-one-half month delay was not presumptively prejudicial and defendant's speedy trial right was not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Family Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii), which convicted him of second-degree terroristic threatening, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 707-715(1) (Supp. 2009) and 707-717(1) (1993).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree terroristic threatening. The complaining witness (CW) was his wife. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in allowing the State to introduce evidence regarding defendant's alleged possession of a gun two weeks prior to the date of the charged incident. Such evidence regarding his possession of the gun, and the CW's knowledge of that possession, was relevant to show the context and circumstances in which the threat was made. Further, the prosecutor should have sought and obtained specific authorization by the trial court before forging ahead with a question to the CW regarding whether she saw defendant with a gun she believed was unregistered because the question violated a pretrial representation the prosecutor made in response to defendant's motion in limine. However, any misconduct by the prosecutor was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Following an argument between defendant and the CW, defendant told his friend that he was going to kill the CW if she tried to leave him. The friend was sufficiently concerned that he warned the CW.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the circumstantial evidence presented was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of credit card fraud under Haw.

Further, the evidence permitted the jury to infer that defendant committed forgery in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 708-852 (Supp. 2009) by forging the victim's signature to a warranty deed because it showed that the victim never told anyone that he was considering selling the property but told friends that he did not want or intend to sell the property, that the victim's will devised the property to his daughter, and that defendant never gave the victim anything of economic value in exchange for the property.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 712-1243 (Supp. 2008). He filed a motion to suppress items of evidence obtained from a warrantless search of his pockets. The Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit, Hawai'i, granted his motion. The State timely filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a warrantless search of defendant's pockets after he had been placed under arrest for outstanding bench warrants, the officer found a baggie containing methamphetamine. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence as the fruit of an illegal search and seizure. The circuit court erred by granting the motion on the basis of the Enos case, which held that a search incident to arrest must be limited in scope to what was reasonably necessary to discover the fruits or instrumentalities of the crime for which the defendant was arrested, or to protect the officer from attack. Without a doubt, the officer's actions in turning defendant's pockets inside-out violated that standard. However, the circuit court erroneously relied on Enos as the basis for its rejection of the State's inevitable discovery argument. Enos was silent on the issue of the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule. The circuit court also erred in failing to enter findings of fact regarding the credibility of the police officers or the weight given to their testimony on the issue of inevitable discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suppression order was vacated, and the case was remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the private owners of oceanfront property, filed an inverse-condemnation lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of 2003 Haw. Sess. Laws 73. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit, Hawai'i, entered an order granting plaintiffs' amended motion for partial summary judgment (PSJ) on their claim for declaratory relief. Defendant, the State of Hawai'i, filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">2003 Haw. Sess. Laws 73 (Act 73) permanently divested a littoral owner of his or her ownership rights to any existing accretions to oceanfront property that were unregistered or unrecorded as of the effective date of Act 73. Plaintiffs claimed that Act 73 took their right to future accretions and thereby violated Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. Plaintiffs sought just compensation or a declaratory judgment that Act 73 was unenforceable. The circuit court erred by granting plaintiffs a partial summary judgment on their claim. The Intermediate Court of Appeals of Hawai'i held that any claims plaintiffs may have to future accretions were purely speculative; they had no vested right to future accretions. Therefore, Act 73 did not effectuate a taking of future accretions without just compensation. Act 73 did effectuate a permanent taking of littoral owners' rights to existing accretions to the owners' oceanfront properties that had not been registered or recorded or made the subject of a quiet-title lawsuit or petition to register the accretions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Intermediate Court of Appeals of Hawai'i vacated the part of the PSJ order which concluded that Act 73 effected an uncompensated taking of and injury to littoral owners' right to ownership of future accreted land. The case was remanded to the circuit court for a determination of whether plaintiffs had accreted lands that existed when Act 73 was enacted and for a determination of the damages they incurred as a result of Act 73's enactment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the First Circuit, Hawai'i, granted judgment in favor of appellee homeowner on the homeowner's lawsuit against appellants, neighbor and tenants, alleging that the neighbor had violated and was continuing to violate the homeowners' association declaration and by-laws. The trial court found that the neighbor had violated the Use Restriction. The neighbor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that there was overwhelming evidence in the record to support the circuit court's finding that the neighbor was carrying on a rooming house, including her admission that she had been renting out rooms in her home for over twenty years. Since the neighbor was collecting rent from those guests and tenants who rented rooms from her, she was clearly carrying on a business in her home, in violation of the Use Restriction. The circuit court's enforcement of the Use Restriction did not deprive the neighbor of all economically beneficial use of her home since she was free to lease her entire home or sell it. No regulatory taking occurred when the circuit court precluded her from renting her rooms to long-term roommates. In ordering the neighbor's long-term renters to leave her home, the circuit court was merely enforcing the Use Restriction of the declaration that the neighbor agreed to comply with as part of her deed, and did not violate her right to privacy. The part of the order requiring the neighbor to provide personal information about her guests to the landowner was vacated. The declaration was not abandoned.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated and remanded with instructions the part of the order requiring the neighbor to provide personal information about her overnight visitors to the landowner's attorney, the circuit court, or the landowner herself, so that they were more narrowly tailored to achieve the circuit court's legitimate objective that the neighbor comply with the declaration. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i) that convicted him of unauthorized possession of confidential personal information, arguing that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence because the police exceeded the scope of his consent to a search for firearms and ammunition when they searched his wallet and discovered another person's driver's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the circuit court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress because the police officer's search for firearms and ammunition pursuant to defendant's consent exceeded the scope of that consent, as nothing about defendant's wallet reasonably suggested the presence of firearms or ammunition within. Further, even if defendant's consent could reasonably be construed as authorizing a search of his wallet, there was no evidence that, when the officer opened the wallet and found no ammunition, the license was in plain view. Because the search and seizure of defendant's wallet was unreasonable, the evidence derived from that search was inadmissible in the criminal prosecution, and the conviction obtained thereby had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court denied the petition without a hearing, determining that the grounds alleged either lacked merit, had no colorable basis, were without a trace of support in the record, were patently frivolous, were previously raised, or were waived. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his extended sentence was a nullity because it was based on Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-662 (Supp. 1996), that his sentence was illegal because the judge sentenced him to an extended term for failing to admit guilt, that his extended sentence was illegal because he was not given a psychological evaluation as required by Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-662(3), that the jury was not given an instruction on the lesser-included offense of sexual assault in the second degree, that the State failed to prove that defendant committed penetration, and that he should have been sentenced pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-606.3 (1993). The court rejected these arguments. Postconviction proceedings under Haw. R. Penal P. 40 were not available when the issues were previously ruled upon or were waived. The circuit court's comment that defendant was unrepentant went to the issue of remorse, which was a permissible factor to consider in sentencing. Defendant's extended sentence was imposed because he was a multiple offender under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-662(4), not because he was a dangerous person under &sect; 706-662(3). Therefore, a psychological exam was not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to defendant's trial, his public defender filed a motion to withdraw under Haw. Prof. Conduct R. 1.16. In addition, defendant filed a pro se motion to dismiss the complaint as unconstitutional in which he claimed that the charges against him had to be dismissed on the grounds of the county and state government operation's selective enforcement of a civil and criminal law was unconstitutional based on racial discrimination and that violated defendant's constitutional rights. The public defender's motion to withdraw was allowed, in part, and defendant's motion to dismiss was denied. The court held that because defendant preserved the right to appeal his convictions based on the denial of his motion to dismiss for racial discrimination but defendant had not made any argument on appeal as to the racial discrimination issue, the argument was waived pursuant to Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4). By failing to argue the racial discrimination issue on appeal, defendant failed to demonstrate that he suffered a substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense or that his trial counsel was ineffective for refusing to file a motion to dismiss based on the racial discrimination issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery in the first degree and burglary in the first degree. The State filed a motion for an extended term of imprisonment, asking that he be sentenced to an extended term of life in prison for robbery in the first degree and 20 years for burglary in the first degree. The trial court granted the State's motion. Defendant filed a petition to vacate, set aside, correct judgment, or to release him from custody. The trial court denied relief. On appeal, the court found that because defendant's case was final in 1998 when his convictions were upheld on appeal, his extended sentences were not illegal or unconstitutional as Maugaotega did not apply to the extended sentences. Further, defendant's burden of restating on appeal the arguments he made in the trial court with respect to his remaining points of error did not impose such a great financial burden to justify exception from Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7). Therefore, his remaining assignments of error were waived.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court held that any minor alleged to have committed an act that would constitute a violation of law was required to be advised of his or her right to testify, and in every Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571-11(1) adjudication in which the accused minor did not testify, the family court was required to engage in a Tachibana-like colloquy to obtain an on-the-record waiver of that right. Because the family court failed to do so, the adjudication was invalid. However, the court rejected the argument that the proceedings violated the minor's constitutional right of sexual privacy. The state legislature had a substantial interest in protecting minors under the age of 14 from sexual contact, even consensual contact, and there was no constitutional, fundamental personal privacy right under Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, for minors under the age of 14 to engage in sexual activities with other children under the age of 14.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother appealed pro se an order of the Family Court of the First Circuit. The custody order was the last in a series of orders issued in response to the mother's motion for post-decree relief, in which she sought, inter alia, to change the legal and physical custody of the youngest child of the mother and defendant father, from the father to the mother. The order gave the father legal and physical custody of the youngest child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family court erred in effecting a change in custody and prohibiting the mother from contacting her children through the ex parte orders without ruling on the validity of the allegations on which the ex parte orders were based or the continued necessity for the orders. It did not comply with due process requirements. The family court did not hold a prompt post-deprivation hearing to address the allegations supporting the change in custody over the children from joint to the father's sole custody or the restraining orders prohibiting the mother from any contact with the children. The change in the custody conditions and the prohibition against the mother contacting her children were supposed to be temporary, lasting until the family court had the opportunity to rule on the merits of the underlying allegations and the need for the changed conditions, but it never ruled on the validity of the allegations or determined whether the continuation of the orders was necessary. In light of the instant decision, the family court was given the opportunity to reconsider its decision denying the mother's request that the father pay her attorney's fees and costs for prior hearings and actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court vacated the custody order to the extent that it granted sole custody of the youngest child to the father; the ex parte orders issued by the family court, which materially affected the decision of the family court to grant sole custody to the father in the custody order; and the order the extent that it denied the mother's request that the father pay her attorney's fees and costs. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i) that convicted him of second-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, attempted first-degree assault, and use of a firearm in the commission of a separate felony, arguing that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the justification defense and that the evidence was insufficient to support the attempted assault conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the trial court's instruction on the defense of others under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 703-305 was proper in instructing the jury that the use of deadly force was not justifiable if defendant knew that he could avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating. The instruction properly advised the jury that defendant must retreat only if he could avoid the necessity of using lethal force with complete safety of the third party; the instruction was not to be interpreted as obligating defendant to retreat to save himself but leaving the third party at risk. Further the evidence was sufficient to support the attempted assault conviction under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 705-500 (1993) and Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-710 (1993). The officer testified that he struggled with defendant, that defendant pointed a gun at him, and that he feared for his life. This was sufficient to enable a reasonable person to conclude that defendant intentionally engaged in conduct that constituted a substantial step in a course of conduct intended to culminate in serious bodily injury to the officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i) convicting her of two counts of negligent failure to control a dangerous dog, in violation of the Honolulu, Haw., Rev. Ordinances &sect; 7-7.2 (1990 &amp; Supp. No. 7, 8-05 &amp; Supp. No. 12, 2-08).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's Rottweiler dog attacked and bit two children on a beach. The dog was unleashed. Defendant argued that the City of Honolulu lacked enforcement jurisdiction over the case because the attacks took place while the children were in ocean water. Pursuant to the statutory grant of authority set forth in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 46-1.5 (13), (14) (Supp. 2004), the City had the power to enact and enforce Honolulu, Haw., Rev. Ordinances &sect; 7-7.2, which made it a crime for a dog owner to negligently fail to control a dangerous dog. The two dog attacks occurred in shallow water, very close to the shoreline of an Oahu beach, the attacks clearly took place within the waters and archipelagic waters adjacent to the island of Oahu and thus within the City's territorial limits, under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-1 (Supp. 2008) and Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4-3 (1993). There was substantial evidence that defendant's dog was the one that committed the attacks and that defendant failed to take reasonable measures to prevent the attacks. Because the dog died of natural causes during the pendency of the appeal, defendant's challenge of the order of the humane destruction of the dog was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and the sentence of the first offense. The court remanded for resentencing on the second offense because the district court was authorized to impose either a term of probation or imprisonment, but not both.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the circuit court did not err in denying the petition without holding a hearing because petitioner presented no colorable claim entitling him to relief. Evidence that defendant placed clothing in a messenger bag that he was carrying and that he struggled with store security personnel when they attempted to stop him from leaving the store with the items was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because it showed that defendant was committing a theft and used force to overcome the resistance of others. The evidence was not insufficient based upon the prosecution's failure to introduce the bag into evidence because the bag was not an element of the offense and was not so critical to the defense that the failure to produce the bag rendered the trial fundamentally unfair. Further, the prosecutor did not commit misconduct under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 635-52 (1993) in reenacting the fighting pose that defendant took toward store security personnel because security personnel had demonstrated the pose while testifying and because it was permissible for the prosecutor to illustrate the events based upon his interpretation of the events.</SPAN></P>

The victim was suffering from terminal lung cancer and was in hospice status, and her grim prognosis made it unlikely that she would be available to testify or capable of testifying at defendant's trial. The victim's testimony was material because she was the alleged victim and only eyewitness of the sexual assault charges and was also a victim of the kidnapping and terroristic threat charges. The court rejected defendant's claim that his conviction for kidnapping one victim should have been reduced from a class A felony to a class B felony under Haw. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother appeals an order of the Family Court of the Second Circuit (Hawaii), which granted sole legal and physical custody of the parties' child to petitioner father, and granted the father leave to relocate to the mainland with child. The mother also challenged an ex parte order awarding the father sole custody and an order granting in part the mother's motion to vacate the ex parte order and two purported stipulated orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the family court erred in failing to find that the ex parte order was unconstitutional and in finding that the issue was moot. The appellate court agreed, noting that the order affected the outcome of the hearing on custody and relocation, and that the collateral consequences exception to the mootness doctrine applied. The appellate court further held that the mother was deprived of custody without the required procedural protections and that such violation was not harmless. As for the mother's request for discovery from the second guardian ad litem (GAL), the appellate court concluded that the family court abused its discretion in granting, without limitation, the GAL's request to preclude production of her documents, as Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571-87(b) (2006) mandated a determination of the reasonableness of a GAL's fees, a finding of necessity as to the amounts in excess of the maximum allowed, and the court's approval of the fees. As for the mother's requests for discovery from the therapist, the appellate court concluded that the mother was entitled to the discovery requested, because the therapist's opinions played a critical role in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family court's final order, ex parte order, order regarding the motion to vacate, and finding of fact and conclusions of law were vacated. The case was remanded to the family court with directions to restore the custody and visitation schedule set forth in the California judgment, appointment of a new guardian ad litem, development of a detailed parenting plan, and review and adjustment of the child support order in the California judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the State of Hawaii Office of Information Practices (OIP) and the Director of the Office of Information Practices, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (Hawaii), which denied their motion for summary judgment and awarded summary judgment to plaintiffs, a county, a county council, and council members, in an action for an order declaring the OIP's opinions invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county council held a closed meeting to discuss whether it should investigate allegedly unethical activity of the police department. The OIP decided that, with the exception of certain attorney-client communications, the Hawaii Sunshine Law, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92-1 (1993), did not support the closed meeting. The OIP demanded that the county release the minutes of the closed meeting. Plaintiffs brought an action against defendants, seeking an order declaring the OIP's opinions invalid. The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that most of the discussion at the closed meeting concerned the proper procedure to use in conducting an investigation of the police department and what topics should be discussed in a future executive session, legal questions that pertained to the council's powers, duties, and immunities. Thus, the meeting was properly closed pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92-5(a)(4). Redacting the privileged portions of the meeting would have been impractical. Further, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92-12 permitted plaintiffs to bring suit to determine the applicability of the Sunshine Law to the discussions or decisions of the council.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii), which dismissed his action against appellee insurers to recover interest on medical fees for services rendered to injured employees. The physician sought a declaration that Haw. Admin. R. 12-15-94(d), which prohibited appeals of decisions from the Director of the Hawaii Department of Labor and Industrial Relations in billing disputes, was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician treated employees who had sustained work-related injuries. The insurers disputed the physician's charges. The Director denied the physician's request that the insurers be required to pay interest. The circuit court dismissed the physician's action for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that Rule 12-15-94(d) did not permit appeals of the Director's decisions in billing disputes over medical fees. On appeal, the court held that Rule 12-15-94(d) was inconsistent with the statutory right granted to parties to appeal the Director's decisions under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386-73 (Supp. 2007) and &sect; 386-87 (1993). Rule 12-15-94(d) was invalid as beyond the Director's rule-making power. The circuit court erred in dismissing the physician's claim for a declaration that Rule 12-15-94(d) was invalid. Because the Director's decisions in the medical fee disputes were not pursuant to an agency hearing and were not rendered in contested cases, the physician was not entitled to appeal the merits of the Director's decisions to the circuit court. However, he was entitled to file appeals of the Director's decisions with the Hawaii Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the portions of the circuit court's judgments that dismissed the physician's claims for declaratory relief. The court directed the circuit court to enter judgment in favor of the physician declaring that the no-appeal provision of Rule 12-15-94(d) was invalid. The court remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. The court affirmed the remainder of the circuit court's judgments.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued, in substance, that the State's enforcement of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1249.5 and Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 329-43.5 against him violated his right to the free exercise of religion and his right to privacy under the Hawai'i Constitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for abusing and threatening the victim, his ex-girlfriend, on three occasions. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion to sever the trial by the date of the offense under Haw. R. Penal P. 14 because it duly balanced the possible prejudice to defendant against the public's interest in judicial economy and it presented the jury with instructions nearly identical to those in the Balanza case. The trial court erred by failing to give a merger instruction to the jury pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 701-109(1)(e) because factual issues existed as to whether the second-degree assault and household abuse charges were grounded in the same conduct by defendant or arose out of the same intent, impulse, or scheme. The trial court did not err by admitting into evidence Japanese x-rays of the victim because they were not hearsay and the victim's testimony was sufficient to establish that she had been x-rayed at a hospital in Japan, given the x-ray photographs immediately thereafter, and personally brought the x-rays back to Hawaii.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions of assault and household abuse were vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was criminally convicted following a fight in which he retrieved a sawed-off shotgun from the trunk of his car, loaded the shotgun with ammunition, and pointed the shotgun at the victim. He was not barred from challenging the legality of his multiple punishments in his third petition for post-conviction relief. The Intermediate Court of Appeals of Hawai'i held that his convictions for place to keep firearm, prohibited possession of a firearm, and possession of a prohibited firearm or device did not result in unlawful multiple punishments. There was no double jeopardy violation, since the offenses did not share all the same elements. However, he was subjected to unlawful multiple punishments based upon his convictions for possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition. The circuit court should have held a hearing on this claim before denying his Rule 40 petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment denying the petition for post-conviction relief was vacated.

The trial court excluded the evidence under Haw. R. Evid. 401 and 403 on the grounds that defendant's tax theories were irrelevant and would confuse the jury. On appeal, the court held that the trial court harmfully erred in excluding documentary evidence defendant offered to show his understanding of the tax laws because the evidence was admissible on the issues of whether he willfully filed false tax returns and obtained the refunds by deception. The exhibit provided evidence that years prior to filing his 1999 and 2000 tax returns, defendant had prepared and submitted a document to the State Department of Taxation and other agencies that set forth the legal theories on which he claimed his good-faith belief was based.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the only fact the owners identified as being in dispute was whether the resident manager of the condominium project gave them unqualified permission to park their vehicles on the property when the owners were not in residence. As this fact was assumed to be true for the purposes of the association's motion, it was not in dispute. The association was not required to make a separate demand for trial de novo after the owners made their demand. Mere notice to the association that the owners intended to file for trial de novo in federal district court did not divest the state court jurisdiction over the matter. The association did not act under color of law and thus, the circuit court properly dismissed the owners' procedural and substantive due process counterclaims. The owners raised no factual grounds or legal arguments supporting the proposition that it was reasonable for them to rely on this permission to permanently store their vehicles at the condominium project. The owners' arguments that the association was precluded from its recovering attorneys' fees were deemed waived.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii) denied, without a hearing, the inmate's petition to vacate, set aside, or correct judgment under Haw. R. Penal. P. 40. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to appeal the issue of his &quot;forced testimony.&quot; The inmate contended that during his trial, when the prosecution finished earlier than had been anticipated and none of the defense's witnesses were ready to testify, the trial court demanded that the inmate testify or waive testifying. The court held that because the inmate's appellate counsel was not given an opportunity to explain his understanding of the issue, and the issue was not fully briefed and argued at a hearing on the Rule 40 petition, the court was unable to determine why the issue was not raised, and remanded that issue for a hearing. The inmate failed to demonstrate the existence of extraordinary circumstances necessary to rebut the presumption that he knowingly waived issues of due process and the right to a fair trial. The court rejected the inmate's claim that his extended sentence violated Apprendi and its progeny because his sentence and direct appeal became final on or about July 20, 2003, long before the United States Supreme Court's decisions in Blakely and Booker in 2004 and 2005, and those decisions were not applicable retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed as to the inmate's ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the case was remanded for the appointment of counsel and a Rule 40 hearing. The order was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On September 23, 2005, the mother, on behalf of her 15-year-old daughter, filed an ex parte petition for a temporary restraining order against the father under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 586-3 (1993 &amp; Supp. 2004). The father had allegedly physically and psychologically abused the daughter by striking her during a heated argument about her assisting a friend in obtaining a birth control product. The trial court granted a temporary restraining order. The order had an expiration date of December 22, 2005. On appeal, the court found that the appeal was moot because the temporary restraining order had expired. The court was unable to provide an effective remedy. No exception to the mootness doctrine applied. The daughter was no longer a minor. The father's claims that he would suffer a negative collateral consequence were too speculative to show that he would suffer substantial continuing consequences from the September 23, 2005 temporary restraining order. Because the court was unable to reach the merits of the father's claim, it vacated the trial court's orders so that they would not have any issue preclusive effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order regarding the temporary restraining order. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sole point of error on appeal was that the circuit court erred in granting the State's motion for extended term sentencing.

The State conceded that in light of the prior action, it could not have in good faith argued that defendant's extended term of imprisonment was imposed in a manner that passed constitutional muster. The court found that defendant's extended term sentence must have been vacated because the sentencing court and not the jury made findings of fact that were necessary to impose defendant's extended term sentence pursuant to former Haw.

On appeal, the court held that the assessments levied under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 431:2-215 were an illegal tax under Haw. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3 because, insomuch as the public at large was the primary beneficiary, and the insurers themselves were only incidental beneficiaries of the regulation of the insurance industry, the assessments were invalid taxes and not fees under the Medeiros test. Further, the assessments were not allocated directly to defraying the costs of providing services to the insurers and were not reasonably proportionate to benefits received by the insurers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary and possession of burglar's tools, and was sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 706-661, 706-662(1) (Supp. 2003). The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii) denied defendant's motion to reduce his sentence in part by declining to reduce the 10-year extended term of imprisonment imposed on the burglary count. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties agreed that pursuant to State v. Maugaotega, defendant's sentence had to be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing. The court held that Act 1 of the 2007 Second Special Session (Act 1), 2007 Haw. Sess. L., Second Special Session, which amended Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 706-661, 706-662, 706-664, could be applied retroactively to defendant's resentencing because such application would not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, as: (1) under Act 1, defendant was subject to the same 10-year term of imprisonment based on the same criteria as he was when he committed the offense of second-degree burglary; and (2) the change made by Act 1, namely providing defendant with the right to have a jury determine the facts necessary to impose an extended term, was a procedural change and therefore fell within an exception to the ex post facto prohibition. The State's failure to allege in defendant's complaint the facts necessary to establish defendant's eligibility for an extended term as a persistent offender did not prevent the State from seeking an extended term on remand.</SPAN></P>

Admin. R. 13-104-24, and a garment violation under Haw. Admin. R. 13-123-22(g)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was paid to take several individuals out on a guided feral goat hunt in a forest reserve. He was convicted of two offenses thereafter, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that defendant's guided hunting license, which was entered pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183D-25.5 (Supp. 2006), was not a written permit that authorized him to engage in commercial activities within the forest reserve. The primary purpose of &sect; 183D-25.5 was to protect consumers and enhance public safety by ensuring that hunting guides and the people they were leading had some minimal level of training. However, Haw. Admin. R. 13-104-24 served a distinct regulatory purpose, which was to control activity within forest reserves. Defendant's assertion that the hunting license was sufficient was inconsistent with the plain language of the provisions, as well as their intent. Finally, Haw. Admin. R. 13-104-24 was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave a person of ordinary intelligence reasonable notice that they were not allowed to engage in any kind of commercial activity within a forest reserve without first receiving permission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff borrower brought suit against defendants, including a lender bank, challenging the validity of a power-of-sale procedure applied during foreclosure proceedings. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii) granted the lender's motion for summary judgment. The borrower appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borrower argued that the circuit court, when analyzing the non-judicial foreclosure procedure in question, erred in utilizing the power of sale procedures outlined in Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 667-5 through 667-10 (1993) instead of Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 667-21 through 667-42 (Supp. 1998). The appellate court disagreed, noting that: (1) the right to exercise a power of sale under either set of statutes derived from a contractual and not a statutory basis; (2) according to the valid terms of an agreement between the parties, the lender was given the right to elect the power of sale to be applied during the foreclosure proceedings; and (3) the bank validly exercised its rights by proceeding under Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 667-5 through 667-10. The borrower argued that such proceedings were unconstitutional, but the appellate court noted that &sect;&sect; 667-5 through 667-10 neither encouraged nor compelled the inclusion of power-of-sale terms in a mortgage agreement, and did not compel the exercise of the power of sale. Thus, state involvement in the exercise of this foreclosure procedure was insufficient to implicate state or federal due process guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued that he was entitled to a hearing on the Rule 40 petition because he did not receive certain police reports during discovery, and because a witness who was not available at the original trial would be able to testify in a new trial that petitioner did not violate the restraining order. An exhibit to the petition included a declaration by this witness. However, the appellate court held that: (1) the petition did not establish that he had requested discovery and that the reports were accordingly improperly withheld; (2) because the petition did not indicate when he learned of the existence of these reports, petitioner did not rebut the presumption that his failure to file a direct appeal and raise this issue then constituted a waiver by him; (3) the petition failed to establish that the reports would probably have changed the outcome of the case; and (4) the witness's declaration did not establish a colorable claim that would justify a hearing because, among other considerations, the petition did not indicate that the substance of the declaration was unavailable to petitioner when he failed to file a direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii), which convicted him of three counts of first degree sexual assault for the alleged molestation of his niece.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Years after the alleged incidents, defendant's niece reported that he had forced her to engage in oral sex. Defendant was convicted, and he sought review. In affirming, the appellate court held that the trial court did not commit plain error in allowing him to be convicted of three counts of first degree sexual assault under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-730(1)(b) (1993), rather than one count of continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of fourteen years under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-733.5 (Supp. 1997). The fact that &sect; 707-733.5 was in effect when defendant was indicted was irrelevant because it did not operate retroactively; the prosecution did not have the option of charging him with either offense. The victim's testimony that sexual assaults took place in defendant's bedroom and his car on more than one instance did not implicate Haw. R. Evid. 404(b) (Supp. 2006), but constituted direct evidence. A clinical psychologist was qualified to testify as an expert on the dynamics of child sexual abuse under Haw. R. Evid. 702 (1993).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insurance agents brought claims against appellants, their employer, its parent company, and several employees, when the agents were terminated without prior written notice and the employer retained the books of business generated by the agents. Ultimately, the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit, Hawaii, awarded the agents damages on breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims, plus attorneys fees. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review from the final judgment and an amended judgment, appellants contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred by awarding unjust enrichment to the agents and allowing the agents to adduce evidence at trial of their expert's revised calculations of unjust enrichment. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that no adequate remedy at law existed and the equitable remedy of unjust enrichment was therefore appropriate because, although the tort and unjust enrichment claims were founded on the same wrongful conduct, the deprivation of the agents' books of business, the remedies sought were sufficiently distinct to exclude this case from the realm of &quot;double recovery&quot; situations. Because the agents' damages were not ascertainable or remediable by reference to the contractual remedies provided for, equitable remedies were appropriate. Further, the trial court did not err by finding that appellants had adequate opportunity to cross-examine the agents' expert on the figures he used at trial; appellants took advantage of that opportunity, and the agents disclosed their methodology well in advance of trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Hawaii), which convicted him of third-degree sexual assault, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-732(1)(c) (Supp. 2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of third-degree sexual assault for knowingly engaging in sexual contact with a minor who was between 14 and 16 years old. At the time of the offense, defendant was 36 years old and the complaining witness (CW) was 14 years old. On appeal, the court found no merit to defendant's contention that &sect; 707-732(1)(c) was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to his conduct. The Hawaii Supreme Court had rejected challenges to the constitutionality of the statute and the definition of &quot;sexual contact&quot; in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-700 (1993). Further, the court rejected defendant's claim that the jury instructions on the offense constituted a constructive amendment of, or fatal variance from, the indictment. The proof required by the jury instructions matched the charge alleged in the indictment. Finally, the trial court did not err in limiting defendant's cross-examination of the CW by precluding him from asking her whether she had ever lied to her mother or best friend. Defendant was able to impeach the CW with more probative evidence, including evidence that she had made inconsistent statements to her mother and others in reporting what defendant had done to her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii), which entered an order denying his petition to vacate and set aside judgment under Haw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed from the order denying his petition to vacate and set aside judgment, but the intermediate court affirmed. In the underlying criminal case, a jury found the petitioner guilty of two counts of sexual assault in the fourth degree. The circuit court sentenced him to 30 days of imprisonment and one year of probation and ordered him to pay fees. On appeal, he contended that the circuit court erred in denying him a hearing on his Haw. R. Penal P. 40 petition because he showed a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He also argued that the circuit court erred by failing to state findings of fact and conclusions of law. The intermediate could held that his claims were without merit. In denying the R. 40 petition, the circuit court filed its 24-page order that contained findings of fact and conclusions of law. Petitioner's points on appeal failed to comply with Haw. R. App. R. 28(b)(4)(C) by quoting the finding or conclusion urged as error. Although the intermediate court could, at its option, notice plain error in those circumstances, based on its review of the record, it had not identified any plain error in the order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Family Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii) in which he was convicted of terroristic threatening in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was unlawfully arrested in his home after the police entered without consent. Subsequently, he confessed to the crime, and the trial court admitted the confession during trial. Defendant was convicted. In vacating the judgment, the court held that under Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, a statement taken at the police station after an unlawful arrest in a suspect's home remained subject to suppression as the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree,&quot; even though the police had probable cause to arrest all along. Because defendant's statement was the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; of his unlawful arrest, it should have been suppressed. Further, the admission of the statement was not harmless error because it was a complete confession to the crime, and the prosecution admitted that it was the most important part of the State's evidence. Further, defendant consistently denied the crime before the jury until he was confronted with his statement. Thus, the erroneous admission of the statement was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and a new trial was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the amended judgment and remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
