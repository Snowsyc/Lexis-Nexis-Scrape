The record was at best equivocal on the question of whether the incriminating character of the objects was immediately apparent. But what was clear from the record was that the officer had already assured himself that appellant did not have a weapon by the time he was gripping and inquiring about the small, hard objects. Therefore, the officer was required to have stopped the search; [2]-The informant's information did not give rise to a reasonable belief that a certain person had committed a crime. Therefore, the officers did not have probable cause to arrest until after defendant admitted that the objects in his underwear were cocaine.</SPAN></P>

It was misconduct for the prosecutor to attempt to elicit information regarding the substance of the tip, which had previously been ruled inadmissible and as a result, the burden was on the State to demonstrate the lack of prejudice. The State, however, failed to address the issue of prejudice in its brief and the appellate court was therefore not required to undertake a harmless-error analysis. Moreover, the misconduct was unusually serious.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 45.027 for a regulated and license title insurance entity; moreover, there was nothing in the record showing that an objection was raised when investigators arrived; [2]-The rules of evidence did not strictly apply at the administrative hearing; therefore, documents were properly admitted into evidence under Minn. Stat. &sect; 14.60, subd. 1 and Minn. R. 1400.7300, subpt. 1 (2011); [3]-Substantial evidence supported the Commissioner's conclusion that there was a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 60K.54 due to a failure to report violations in Nebraska and Kansas; [4]-The insurance agency acted as a closing agent without a valid license; [5]-Minn. Stat. &sect; 60K.49 was violated because the agency engaged in the business of insurance without the appointment of an insurer.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 1(5), and the pretrial order suppressing the results of the breath test clearly had a critical impact on the prosecution's case because it would result in dismissal of one of the charges and prevent the State from prosecuting defendant, and thus the State met the critical impact test; [2]-Defendant voluntarily consented to the breath test, and he did not claim his consent was coerced, and instead he was given a chance to speak with counsel, he declined, and he agreed to submit to a breath test after being given the implied-consent advisory; [3]-The district court therefore erred in finding that defendant's consent was not voluntary and in granting his motion to suppress, and the order was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 626.21 (2012) was not proper because the section did not authorize an independent action for damages; [4]-Appellant's claim seeking to hold the judge liable for her judicial act of issuing the search warrant was barred by judicial immunity.</SPAN></P>

IV when an officer approached defendant in the train station restroom because although the officer's approach was preceded by plainclothes officers' attempt to engage defendant in conversation and a dog's sniff of his luggage, none of the circumstances alone or together would cause a reasonable person in defendant's situation to feel that he was not free to leave.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">ISSUE: Whether the denial of a motion to dismiss filed by defendant charged with first-degree refusal to submit to chemical testing was proper. HOLDINGS: [1]-The State's warrantless attempt to obtain a urine sample from defendant was constitutional under the consent exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, as defendant had agreed to take a urine test, and she did not dispute the police had probable cause to arrest her for DWI or contend the police did not follow the proper implied-consent procedures; [2]-Although it would have been preferable for a female officer to monitor the collection of the urine sample, the manner in which the male officer conducted the urine collection was not unconstitutionally unreasonable because the intrusion was minor compared to the compelling public interest of protecting residents from drivers under the influence of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

It  was reasonable for officers to suspect that an employee of the pawn shop might destroy evidence if given the chance, might be engaged in drug distribution, and might be armed and dangerous.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 240.04, subd. 7 (2012); [2]-Substantial evidence supported the decision that a Table Master was a gambling device under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.75, subd. 4, because its outcome was determined principally by chance; [3]-While the use of Table Master was card playing, no distributor could have provided it to the licensee, pursuant to Minn.

Stat. &sect; 169A.75 (2012) did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the public safety department to authorize testing methods; [4]-The Commissioner of Public Safety did not improperly delegate rulemaking authority to the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and there was no violation of the Minnesota Administrative Procedures Act because the policy of not prohibiting first-void testing was consistent with the plain meaning of the implied consent law.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 17.03, subd. 1, the trial court's omission of an instruction to consider each of the charges separately did not require a new trial because the court emphasized that there were separate verdict forms and that the jury had to sign a verdict for each count.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested for DWI and transported to a medical center where he consented to a blood test that revealed a BAC of 0.16. The trial court did not err by denying his motion to suppress the blood test results, because exigent circumstances rendered the warrantless search and seizure of his blood reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.
