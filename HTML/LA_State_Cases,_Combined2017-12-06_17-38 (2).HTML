The caution barriers on the shoulder did not prevent the normal traffic flow in the right-hand lane of the interstate highway.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's plea of entrapment on three counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81(A)(2), was a defense on the merits and, therefore, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 703 as it related to the entrapment defense. The appellate court applied the law of the case doctrine and declined to reconsider its prior ruling on defendant's motion to quash, specific to the entrapment defense, which was issued on a pretrial writ application because there was nothing additional for it to consider.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 22035 became effective on August 8, 2005 and was to be applied prospectively only. The installation and implementation of park-and-display stations in January 2005 changed the parking meter system throughout the city. Citizens were entitled to notice that the stations were being used to issue citations for violations, in lieu of coin-operated meters. That was especially important for those areas in which both the meters and the stations were simultaneously operational. Because the ordinance was civil, it did not offend the prohibition against ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In conducting an error patent review pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc.

However, the trial court's sentence did not specify how many years were to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. As the statute gave the trial court discretion as to the number of years imposed to be served without benefits, the court had to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing. Because the court vacated the sentence, further proceedings remained, and counsel's motion to withdraw was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to theft of loud speakers valued at over $ 1,000 in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67B. The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, deferred his sentence and placed him on 2 years of probation. His probation was subsequently revoked, and the trial court sentenced defendant to 10 years at hard labor. Defendant sought review, challenging his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was a teenager at the time of the crime, contended that the imposition of the maximum sentence under &sect; 14:67B was clearly excessive. Defendant's probation was revoked because he tested positive for marijuana and he subsequently provided a false urine test. He stipulated to the revocation of probation as the trial court recommended boot camp. Approximately one year after the revocation, defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1 as his medication prevented him from attending boot camp. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant along with two co-defendants stole loud speakers from a school. He had no prior criminal record. The court concluded that the maximum sentence was not warranted as it did not involve the most serious violation of &sect; 14:67B nor the worst type of offender. After it was shown defendant could not attend boot camp, the imposition of the sentence was a purposeless infliction of pain and the trial court abused its discretion. The court found a sentence between 2 to 4 years seemed appropriate under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted him of one count of first-degree murder for the homicide of two victims under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:30.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State failed to exclude the reasonable hypothesis that he was guilty of manslaughter. Defendant contended that the State's evidence showed that he had terminated his involvement in the burglary and had begun to flee when his co-defendant shot and killed the victims. Defendant argued that his statement indicated he participated in an unarmed burglary and that the State failed to present evidence to establish that his gun was operable. The State contended that the evidence clearly showed that defendant was engaged in the commission of an aggravated burglary and an armed robbery that resulted in two homicides. The decision was upheld because it was immaterial whether defendant's gun was unloaded or inoperable. Defendant admitted that he entered a house with a gun and removed property from the victims. Defendant stated that he told the female victim to go into the living room then loaded the van with items taken from the residence. Thus, the evidence supported a finding that defendant committed both aggravated burglary and armed robbery. Even if he only intended to rob the victims, as he claimed in his statement, this would not absolve him from responsibility.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted in the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) of second-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued, inter alia, that the trial court improperly allowed a child witness to testify by closed-circuit television rather than in the court room in violation of the Confrontation Clause of U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court of appeal disagreed. Where necessary to protect a child witness from trauma that would be caused by testifying in the physical presence of the defendant, at least where such trauma would impair the child's ability to communicate, the Confrontation Clause did not prohibit use of a procedure that, despite the absence of face-to-face confrontation, ensured the reliability of the evidence by subjecting it to rigorous adversarial testing and preserved the essence of effective communication. An expert testified for the State that if the child were required to testify in open court, he would likely suffer extreme emotional distress and would have been unable to reasonably communicate to the jury. The expert's testimony conformed to the Maryland v. Craig standard that the emotional distress the child witness would suffer in the presence of the defendants was more than de minimis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine and sentenced to life in prison as a third felony offender. He sought post-conviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel as his attorney failed to appeal from a district court's denial of his motion to correct an illegal sentence and motion to reconsider sentence. The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, denied his application. He sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed that his sentence was excessive under the amendments to the Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1529.1, which no longer mandated a life sentence. At the hearing on the motion to reconsider sentence, the district court found that under &sect; 15:1529.1, appellant was still eligible for a life sentence at the discretion of the sentencing court. The court found that the district court misstated the sentencing range under &sect; 15:1529.1(A)(1)(b)(ii), which provided a maximum sentence of 10 years under the circumstances of the case. It did not appear that the district court felt it had the discretion to impose a sentence other than life. While amendments to &sect; 15:1529.1, which reduced mandatory minimum sentences, had prospective application only, the district court could have and should have considered the amendments in determining whether appellant's mandatory minimum sentence was constitutionally excessive. The court concluded that remand was appropriate to afford appellant the opportunity to prove that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutionally excessive as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the apparent life sentence and remanded for a new hearing on the motion to reconsider sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966 (A)(1). He was adjudicated a second felony offender and sentenced to 40 years at hard labor &quot;without benefit,&quot; and fined $20,000. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the imposition of a $20,000.00 fine was unconstitutional because he was indigent and unable to pay due to his prison sentence. The court of appeal agreed, but for different reasons. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, the habitual offender statute, did not authorize imposition of a fine, but only provided for enhanced sentences relating to the term of imprisonment. A trial court is without authority to impose a fine under this statute. Thus, because the trial court sentenced defendant under the habitual offender statute, it was without authority to impose a fine. Therefore, although based on different grounds, this assignment of error had merit and defendant's sentence is amended to delete the $20,000.00 fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed, the sentence was amended, and as amended was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal disagreed. Under the guidelines, the burden was on the party claiming obsolescence to give the assessor sufficient data to support the claim. There was no basis for shifting the burden of proof: the burden was, and remained, with the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Vermilion (Louisiana) to manslaughter and was sentenced to 35 years at hard labor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court imposed an excessive sentence under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 considering the factual circumstances and history of abuse between defendant and the victim. Specifically, she asserted that she was a 44-year-old mother who had supported her family through a life of abuse; that it was her first felony offense; and that the trial court failed to give adequate weight to the mitigating circumstances. The court of appeal disagreed. The record supported the trial court's conclusion; it reflected a history of mutual physical abuse between defendant and her husband, including a prior instance when defendant shot her husband and another previous incident when defendant attacked him in his sleep. Moreover, the record also reflected that defendant frequently threatened to shoot her husband in the head. Additionally, by entering into the plea agreement defendant reduced her sentencing exposure from life imprisonment to 40 years. Therefore, the sentence did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded for the trial court to inform defendant of the prescriptive period for filing for post-conviction relief. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. The court of appeal disagreed. Accomplices committed an aggravated burglary when they entered the victim's house without authorization, and although they arrived after the break-in, the victims were all present in the house. The accomplices intended to commit a felony therein--armed robbery. When they broke into the house, they were already armed with a sawed-off shotgun, and they further armed themselves by stealing a handgun the bedroom. Although the defendant was not physically present in the house, the testimony supported a conclusion that defendant was involved in the commission of the offenses. Defendant drove the accomplices to the house, acted as a lookout and was intended to be the &quot;getaway driver&quot; once the robbery was completed. The accomplice's testimony was sufficient to establish that he, defendant, and another person agreed to commit an armed robbery with the purpose of &quot;getting some money&quot; and that they made an act in furtherance of the conspiracy when they drove to the abandoned house to retrieve the sawed-off shotgun eventually used in the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentences for armed robbery and conspiracy to commit armed robbery were vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing on those charges. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee out-of-state hospital filed an action for declaratory relief and damages against appellant Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH). The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, granted the hospital's motion for partial summary judgment, finding that the DHH's reimbursement methodology was unconstitutional and was applied in a manner that discriminated against the hospital. The DHH appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital challenged a rule promulgated by the DHH that reimbursed out-of-state (border) hospitals differently than in-state hospitals that provided inpatient hospital services to Louisiana Medicaid patients. The hospital argued that the reimbursement methodology violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court found that the State's role was that of market regulator, which meant that the DHH rule as applied to the hospital was subject to scrutiny under the Commerce Clause. The DHH claimed that its rule was for the purpose of assuring the continued viability for rural hospitals. The court found that it was a protectionist measure and the DHH offered nothing to show that its objective of preserving small rural hospitals could not be accomplished by nondiscriminatory alternatives. Thus, the reimbursement rule was unconstitutional as it applied to the hospital and violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1300.144(A)(3)(b). However, the trial court's declaration that the rule was unconstitutional on its face was error as the evidence was insufficient to show that other border hospitals experienced the discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment and found that the DHH's reimbursement rule as it applied to the hospital was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment as amended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the 22nd Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany, Louisiana, which denied his motion to quash the bill of information that charged him with possession of marijuana, second offense under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(C). He argued that the charged offense was not his second offense and that &sect; 40:966 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a guilty plea that reserved his right to challenge the denial of his motion to quash. Defendant maintained that the instant offense was not punishable as a second offense because it was committed before he was convicted for his prior possession of marijuana offense. He argued that &sect; 40:966(E)(2) should be interpreted as requiring a second offense be committed after the conviction for the first offense. The State argued that a plain reading of &sect; 40:966(E)(2) did not require that the first conviction occur before the commission of the second offense. The court concluded that &sect; 40-966 was not unconstitutionally vague. Pursuant to case law precedent and finding no legislative amendment to the contrary, the court held that defendant could not be guilty of the crime of possession of marijuana, second offense, unless such crime was committed after the conviction for the first offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, granted the motion to quash, vacated defendant's guilty plea conviction and sentence, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not re-urge the motion at any point during the trial. Defendant did not unequivocally indicate to the trial court that he wanted to represent himself in this prosecution without the assistance of any counsel. Instead, he requested to be allowed to act as co-counsel, in conjunction with his court-appointed attorney. While the defendant had the right to counsel as well as the right to self-representation, he had no constitutional right to be both represented and representative.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was working for appellee employer as part of a work-release program when he was injured. He filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits but was granted a stay. He filed a petition for a declaration that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1201.4 was unconstitutional. The Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita, Louisiana, found it constitutional and dismissed his petition. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer filed a motion for sanctions for filing a frivolous appeal. The inmate argued that &sect; 23:1201.4 was not substantially related to any legitimate government interest. He lived in a halfway house, and he argued that his wages, not state funds, paid for his needs. The court found that the majority of the inmate's wages were collected and used to pay for his expenses. The state had an interest in prisoners being successfully integrated back into society. The work-release program helped to promote that interest. The statute encouraged employers to hire convicts, avoided duplicative payments to prisoners, and kept down unnecessary workers' compensation claims, which were all appropriate government objectives. The statute did not violate the equal protection clause or the due process class as it bore a rational relationship to legitimate government interests. The inmate failed to show the statute was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners sought review of a judgment from the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, which upheld the assessment of ad valorem tax for 2008 on their two housing developments by defendants, a city and its tax assessor. Plaintiffs had paid the taxes under protest and argued that the properties were exempt pursuant to La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 21(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax assessor testified that improvements on immovable property were exempt from taxation only if the improvements were owned by a public entity or non-profit corporation that used the property for a charitable purposes. The owners were private entities. Upon review, the court found that ownership alone was not determinative of whether the property served a public purpose. Privately-owned property could be dedicated to public use and eligible for tax exempt status. Plaintiffs had entered into agreements to operate 71 of their apartments in their two housing developments as public housing units. The money they derived from the rental of the public housing units was used strictly for the operation and maintenance costs of those units. Plaintiffs did not earn a profit on those units. The court held that to the extent plaintiffs were contractually and legally obligated to operate and maintain the units as public housing, those units had been dedicated to public use, served a public purpose, and thus, were clearly exempt from ad valorem taxes under La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 21(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment and granted a return of the ad valorem taxes paid under protest on the 71 public housing units in plaintiffs' two housing developments.

New Jersey mandated a finding that &sect; 40:966(E) was unconstitutional because the statute allowed the State to increase the maximum sentence to which he was exposed based upon a prior misdemeanor conviction for which he was not entitled to a jury trial. The court of appeal disagreed. The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV, did not preclude the sentence-enhancing use, against an adult, of a prior valid, fair, and reliable conviction of a misdemeanor, obtained as an adult, where the misdemeanor proceeding included all the constitutional protections applicable to such proceedings, even though these protections do not include the right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62.2 and one charge of armed robbery with the use of a firearm under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:64, 14:64.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in imposing an unconstitutionally excessive sentence. First, he argued that the offenses were essentially part of a common scheme or plan because they evidently occurred within a relatively short period of time and that under La. Code Crim. P. art. 883, the trial court erred in not giving specific reasons for ordering the sentences to run consecutively. Second, he argued that because the sentence was imposed consecutively to a life sentence that there was no chance of defendant's release during his natural life even if his life sentence was commuted. Defendant argued that such a sentence constituted the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering prohibited by La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20. The court held that defendant pointed to no evidence in the record to support his claim that the offenses were part of a common scheme or plan other than a bare assertion that the offenses occurred within a relatively short period of time and that imprisonment itself was not necessarily cruel and unusual even if the term of imprisonment was lengthy or if the sentences were imposed consecutively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sales and use tax commission assessed penalties for nonpayment of sales taxes against plaintiff taxpayer. The taxpayer paid the amount due under protest and filed suit against the commission, requesting a refund. The Third Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lincoln, Louisiana, entered summary judgment for the commission. The taxpayer sought review, and the commission sought additional attorney's fees for work done on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was in the business of selling and leasing various articles of tangible property to customers. When entering a lease, a customer could purchase a liability damage waiver (LDW). The commission found that sales tax was due on the LDW sales, and the trial court agreed. The trial court also ordered the taxpayer to pay the commission attorney's fees. Upon review, the court found that the proceeds derived from the LDW sales was subject to the sales tax under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:302(B)(1) as they were derived from the lease or rental of tangible personal property. A penalty was properly assessed against the taxpayer under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1602(A) as it failed to remit the taxes it owed. The taxpayer's payment of the taxes under protest was not a timely payment that avoided its liability for attorney's fees under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1512. La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(A) did not prohibit the award of attorney's fees to the commission. As the commission incurred additional expenses on appeal, the court awarded additional attorney's fees and found $ 2,500 to be a reasonable amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment to award additional attorney's fees for work done on appeal and affirmed the judgment as amended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Criminal District Court for Orleans Parish (Louisiana) of one count of purse snatching. Defendant was sentenced to serve ten years at hard labor concurrently with any other sentence he may be serving. The defendant was subsequently adjudicated a third felony offender and resentenced pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 to serve life imprisonment at hard labor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court abused its discretion when it sentenced him to the life sentence mandated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 without any inquiry as to whether the sentence was excessive under the facts of the case as required by State v. Dorthey. The court of appeals disagreed. None of the mitigating factors defendant presented overwhelmed the presumption that the legislatively-mandated sentence was appropriate. His two prior convictions were for simple robbery and armed robbery. In the case at hand, the defendant implied that he had a weapon and threatened to shoot the victims. A life sentence was the minimum which could be imposed on the defendant under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(2)(b)(i)(ii) because the instant felony conviction and two of his prior felony convictions were crimes of violence as defined by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:2(13). Thus, despite his attempt to present mitigating factors to the court, the defendant failed to provide substantial evidence that exceptional circumstances justified a downward departure from the mandatory term of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

It was the victim's uncontradicted testimony that on the date of the incident she repeatedly denied defendant entry into her home and repeatedly asked him to leave her property. Nevertheless, defendant entered the home and forced his way into the victim's bathroom while she was bathing. Regardless of whether defendant let himself in, or, as defendant testified, the victim's ten-year-old son opened the door for him, it was clear that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that defendant entered the victim's home without the consent of a person with the authority and/or capacity to consent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), which convicted and sentenced him for second-degree murder in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences for second-degree murder and armed robbery with a firearm, but the appellate court affirmed, stating in part that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to allow defendant to question a witness about an incident which did not result in a pending charge or conviction and where there was no prospect of prosecution. Further, any relevance of the domestic abuse complaint was substantially outweighed by the possibility of prejudice, confusion of the issue, or misleading of the jury. Defendant's maximum sentence of 99 years, plus 5 years for a total of one 104 years at hard labor was proper because he purposefully killed the victim by putting the gun to the victim's head and firing at least two times. Further, during defendant's incarceration, he was charged with criminal damage to property and taking contraband into a penal institution. The record also showed that during his detention, defendant committed attempted aggravated escape and battery on a police officer. He was disciplined more than 40 times while incarcerated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Louisiana sought review of a decision of the 24th Judicial District Court Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which granted defendant's motion to quash. Defendant had been charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI), third offense, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98(A)(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had filed a motion to quash the bill of information that alleged the trial judge and the attorney failed to sign the waiver of rights form in his first predicate offense. Defendant then filed a supplemental motion in which he argued that a review of the transcript demonstrated his plea was not voluntarily or knowingly entered. After a hearing was held, the trial court granted defendant's motion to quash the first DWI predicate, finding that the State did not prove a valid waiver of his rights. The court overruled the decision. The transcript of the first predicate conviction showed that defendant, who was unrepresented, knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel before pleading guilty to the first predicate DWI. According to the transcript, defendant appeared in person. At the beginning of the proceeding, the trial judge confirmed defendant's date of birth and also confirmed his social security number and driver's license number. The judge also confirmed that defendant had a 12th grade education.  He explained that defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated on a certain date and was pleading guilty. Defendant agreed that the judge was correct.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant was not an individual without a criminal history. Defendant's sentence for armed robbery was not excessive under the circumstances of the case. It was within the statutory range.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, plaintiff property owners appealed from judgments of the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier (Louisiana), holding that their claims against defendants, the parish police jury, the office of the parish engineer, and the engineer (collectively, the police jury), challenging an ordinance placing portions of their property in a floodway, had prescribed pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3492.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In enacting the ordinance at issue, the police jury adopted recommendations by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and placed portions of the owners' property in the floodway of the Red Chute Bayou rather than in the flood zone, as they were previously classified. The property owners alleged that because of the new classification, encroachments were prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments. The property owners clearly alleged a &quot;taking&quot; in their pleadings and, thus, the three-year prescriptive period of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5111, rather than the one-year period of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3492, was applicable for those claims. The event that triggered the running of prescription was the passage of the ordinance placing the property in the floodway. The ordinance became effective less than one year before the property owners filed their action. Accordingly, the claims had not prescribed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, of distribution of marijuana, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A)(1)(a). He was adjudicated a fourth felony offender and sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without parole, probation, or suspension. After an appeal and remand, defendant was resentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefits. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient. The court noted that the testimony of a single undercover police officer was sufficient to convict. In this case, an undercover officer testified that defendant asked him what he wanted and told him that he could get him two dime bags of marijuana; defendant then left to get the marijuana, returned, and handed the marijuana to the officer in exchange for $ 25. A sergeant testified that he heard the transaction over the officer's audio transmitting device and saw the hand-to-hand exchange. This evidence was sufficient. The State's use of an arrest report containing defendant's fingerprint, in combination with certified minutes and a bill of information, was sufficient to prove that defendant was the same person convicted of simple burglary in 1994. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(F) did not require any specific type of evidence at a habitual offender hearing; prior convictions could be proved by any competent evidence. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1)(c)(ii), defendant's life sentence was mandatory. Therefore, the trial court was not required to comply with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant's conviction, adjudication as a fourth felony offender, and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence by the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), after he was charged with second degree murder and armed robbery but found guilty by a jury of negligent homicide. On the State's information charging defendant as a fourth felony offender, the trial court resentenced defendant to seventy-five years at hard labor under Louisiana's Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and that his sentence under the Habitual Offender Law was unconstitutionally excessive under the Eighth Amendment and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 when applied to the crime of negligent homicide. The court held that the jury chose to give greater weight to the testimony of the State's witnesses and circumstantial evidence such as defendant's avoidance of police after the shooting than it gave to defendant's statement that the victim was shot by a person in a passing car. While the trial judge did not articulate the factual basis for the sentence and no comparable sentences for a quadruple offender convicted of negligent homicide could be found, imposition of the maximum sentence was not excessive in light of the facts of the case and defendant's extensive and violent 15-year criminal history that included first-degree robbery (reduced from an initial charge of armed robbery, a crime of violence) and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Failure of the sentencing court to enumerate the factors listed in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 did not require remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of sexual battery. He was convicted of one count. The victim was a 13-year-old girl. On appeal, he claimed that his conviction on count two was duplicitous of his acquittal on count one. The court found that neither the Blockburger test nor the Louisiana &quot;same evidence&quot; rule supported his assertion of double jeopardy under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 15 and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 591. Defendant was charged with committing the crime of sexual battery on three distinct occasions, each punishable separately. Further, the testimony at trial was sufficient to prove that he intentionally engaged in acts wherein his genitals touched the 13-year-old, non-spouse victim. The victim testified that she had consensual sexual intercourse with him on three occasions in 2006, when she was only 13 years old. The State introduced a copy of defendant's birth certificate, which proved that he was more than three years older than the victim at the time of the offenses. Finally, defendant's sentence was not excessive under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. In sentencing him, the trial judge noted that he was an adult taking advantage of an impressionable child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), convicting him of failure to register as a sex offender between October 8, 2008 and January 8, 2009, after prior convictions for indecent behavior on February 27, 1998 in Oklahoma and third-degree sexual abuse on January 28, 2000 in Iowa, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:542 and sentencing him to 10 years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that defendant was required to register as a sex offender under &sect; 15:542 because his Oklahoma and Iowa convictions were equivalent to Louisiana statutes that required registration; Okla. Stat. art. 21, &sect; 1021(A)(1) was equivalent to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81, and Iowa Code &sect; 709.4(1) was equivalent to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:42, 14:42.1. There was no support for defendant's claims that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:542 applied only to sex offenses against minors or that sex offenders from other states were free from a duty to register in Louisiana if their sex offender convictions in those other states were not subject to registration in those states. Defendant's claim of improper venue was not reviewable because he failed to file a pretrial motion to quash as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 615. The court held that defendant's maximum 10-year sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive given defendant's prior criminal history, which included multiple prior felony convictions including two sex crimes, defendant's defiance in complying with conditions of his probation, and his general recidivist history.</SPAN></P>

The bill of indictment alleged that defendant aided and abetted her husband in his having vaginal intercourse with the victim and that defendant had oral sex with the victim. The victim was a nine-year-old girl whose aunt was a family friend. The appellate court affirmed, stating that from the evidence, the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that penetration occurred during the perpetrator's sexual intercourse with the child with defendant's voluntary participation. Additionally, the record did not support her justification claim. While defendant's testimony supported her contention that she suffered abuse at the hands of her husband, the evidence did not show that at the time she committed either offense she was in imminent peril of great bodily harm, or that she reasonably believed herself or others to have been in such danger.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice action, the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), applied La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42(B) of the Medical Malpractice Act (MMA) to substantially reduce a jury's general damage award. Plaintiffs, parents and their minor child, appealed. The Louisiana Patients' Compensation Fund (PCF) also appealed and defendant nurse practitioner filed a peremptory exception of res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Medical Review Panel and the jury found that the nurse practitioner committed malpractice. The jury a general damage award of $ 6,233,000, which included past medical expenses and judicial interest on the expenses. The trial court, applying the MMA's damages cap, reduced the award to $ 500,000. The MMA's cap on general damage awards unconstitutionally disadvantage and discriminated against the child and her parents because of the severity of the child's physical condition when compared to other malpractice victims who received full recovery for their injuries. Further, the State failed to present sufficient evidence to show that any reasonable basis existed to continue such discrimination by expanding the MMA's limitation on general tort liability to include nurse practitioners. Accordingly, the MMA's cap, when used to limit nurse practitioners' general liability for damages cause to severely or catastrophically injured victims, unconstitutionally violated the Equal Protection Clause of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. Further, past medical expenses were authorized under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.43(B). Finally, there was no merit in the peremptory exception of res judicata.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the exception of res judicata.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a 1939 election regarding prohibition, the parish was voted &quot;dry.&quot; This changed in 1974 with a Louisiana Supreme Court holding that the effect of such earlier prohibition elections was superseded by 1950 legislation requiring local option elections on a ward basis for separate areas throughout a parish. In 1975, the police jury enacted a new ordinance prohibiting Sunday sales of alcohol in District 6. The trial court declared the ordinance invalid on the grounds that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:191 required a vote of the people authorizing the closing of businesses on Sunday, and no such election had occurred. The court held that even assuming that the election required under &sect; 51:191 limited the police jury's power to enact such ordinances, the 1986 legislation did not operate to repeal all existing local ordinances which prohibited the Sunday sales of alcohol. When the legislature removed itself from the regulation of Sunday business enterprise in 1986 without drawing back the police jury's authority under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:493 for Sunday closing laws for alcohol, the ordinance retained its independent force.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of attempted forcible rape in the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana). The district court found him to be a third felony offender, denied defendant's motion to consider a sentence other than life imprisonment, and sentenced defendant to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to declare La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 782(A)&nbsp;unconstitutional to the extent that it allowed for a non-unanimous verdict in non-capital felony cases. Because defendant did not request that the jury be polled, and therefore did not make a record as to whether the verdict was non-unanimous, defendant lacked standing to raise the issue. The court held that, given its comments, the trial court erroneously believed that it had no discretion and that it could not impose any sentence other than the life sentence mandated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. Because the trial court had discretion to impose a sentence of less than the mandatory minimum if defendant could prove that he was exceptional, remand was required. The court held that a guilty plea form in a prior conviction signed by both defendant and his counsel, along with a minute entry showing that defendant was represented by counsel and was interrogated as to his constitutional rights, was sufficient to establish the existence of the prior guilty plea as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sentence but remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing at which defendant could present evidence that he was an exceptional case entitled to be sentenced to less than the mandatory minimum sentence under the Habitual Offender Law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Reading the indictment as a whole, the court of appeal found that the indictment complied with the constitutional requirement that defendant be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, La.

The indictment included the language &quot;unlawfully kill in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.&quot; Said language, which broadly encompassed first degree murder, and the inclusion of the statutory citation for first degree murder, unmistakably conveyed the charges returned in the case. The indorsement of the foreman of the grand jury setting out the charges of first degree murder for which a true bill was found was as much a part of the indictment as the remainder of the document. The State had authority to amend the indictment. In accordance with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 487, the district attorney had complete authority to amend indictment, both as to form and substance, at any time before trial. Because defendant was properly informed of the charges, pretrial amendment of the indictment would not be prejudicial to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2004, a jury in the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, found defendant guilty, of the aggravated rape of A.L. and the sexual battery of B.B. After two appeals, the district court resentenced defendant for the rape to life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, and imprisonment at hard labor for ten years, consecutive, for the battery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had sex with his stepdaughter from the time she was eight or nine years old until she was approximately twelve years old (from 1998 until 2003). Defendant sexually touched his ex-wife's sister from the time she was eight years old until she was twelve years old (from 1988 until 1992). Defendant argued that he received an illegal sentence on the aggravated rape count because the trial judge referred to count one as &quot;aggravated battery&quot; when she sentenced him, rather than aggravated rape. The court disagreed, deciding that the trial judge simply inadvertently said battery instead of rape. The imposed sentence of life imprisonment did not fall within the sentencing range for aggravated battery, only aggravated rape. Defendant also argued that his consecutive sentences were constitutionally excessive. The court held that because defendant failed to explicitly state an objection to the consecutive nature of the sentences, he was not entitled to review of that issue. Defendant failed to prove any unusual circumstances warranting a departure from the mandatory minimum sentence for aggravated rape, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentences for his convictions of aggravated rape and sexual battery were affirmed. The matter was remanded for the corrections of the minute entry and for the trial court to properly advise defendant of the prescriptive period for filing a petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery, attempted armed robbery, and aggravated battery by the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, following the denial of his motion to quash the bill of information. His post-trial motions were denied. He was sentenced to a total effective sentence of 110 years at hard labor. Defendant appealed. A separate appeal was pending on the habitual offender proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 782(A) was constitutional. The state's highest court had followed the United States Supreme Court's holding that non-unanimous 12-person jury verdicts were constitutional. The appellate court was not at liberty to ignore the controlling jurisprudence of superior courts. The trial court properly denied defendant's proposed jury charges. The first request was likely to confuse the jury. The general jury charges informed the jury of its option to return a responsive verdict. Defendant did not offer any jurisprudence to support his third proposed charge. That charge, too, was sufficiently covered in the general charge. Defendant's sentence on the aggravated battery count was illegally lenient. The appellate court exercised its discretion not to correct the illegal sentence and impose the fine required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34. While the commitment reflected that defendant was properly advised of the prescriptive period for filing post-conviction relief under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 930.8, the transcript reflected that defendant received an incomplete advisal. The error was corrected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurer appealed three rulings of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff and class representative insureds who alleged that the insurer failed to comply with its statutory duty under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:658(A)(3) to initiate loss adjustment in a timely manner and thus was liable for statutory penalties provided in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1220.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A class was certified and affirmed for insureds whose loss adjustment after two hurricanes was not begun by the insurer within thirty days after they notified the insurer of their loss. The court reversed the blanket assessment of a minimum penalty of $ 5,000 for each member of three sub-groups within the class. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:658(A)(3) (renumbered as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1892) provided that an insurer had to initiate loss adjustment of a property damage claim within thirty days after notification of loss by the claimant or be subject to penalties provided in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1220 (renumbered as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1973). However, before subjecting the insurer to penalties for failing to initiate loss adjustment in a timely manner, a finding had to be made that the insurer breached the duty of good faith.  Information before the trial court included dates of claims and dates of insurer reports on the claims but not information on what the insurer did between those dates. On the other hand, there was substantial evidence of unusual circumstances following two hurricanes which may have rendered the insurer unable to meet time limits for adjusting claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which convicted him of first-degree robbery in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for first-degree robbery, but the appellate court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient because the manager of the store identified defendant and the testimony of one witness, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to support a finding of guilt. Further, statements by a customer, who was deceased at the time of the trial, qualified under the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule, La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 803(1), because the only statements that were permitted to be introduced concerned what the customer said to the officer when she flagged him down and described the man that she had followed from the store, and his location. Defendant's double-jeopardy rights were not violated by the third trial taking place because he moved for both mistrials; the actions of the State in failing to provide the defense attorney with the reports in question was simply negligence, not intentional; and defendant was not prejudiced by the mistrials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:981.3, distributing cocaine within 1,000 feet of a church. The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, sentenced him to 15 years without probation or suspension of sentence. Defendant sought review of his sentence. Defendant's appellate counsel filed a motion to withdraw.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court allowed defendant's counsel to withdraw as it agreed with her assertion that there were no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal. In reviewing defendant's sentence, the court found that there were two errors that made his original sentence illegally lenient. The trial court found the sentence range pursuant to &sect; 40:981.3 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967 to be 5 to 30 years. However, the range under those statutes was 2 to 45 years. The incorrect calculation affected the calculation of his enhanced sentencing range under the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. As a second felony offender, defendant faced a sentencing range of 22.5 to 90 years. Thus, he received a sentence that was 7.5 years less than the mandatory minimum term. While the court had the authority to correct the sentence under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 882, even though he entered a plea agreement, it declined to do so as defendant was indigent. The trial court also failed to impose the mandatory fine of $50,000 as required by &sect; 40:981.3 and &sect; 40:967, but the court found that failure harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court granted appellate defense counsel's motion to withdraw. The court advised defendant that any application for post-conviction relief could not be filed more than 2 years after the judgment of conviction and sentence have become final under the provisions of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 914 or 922.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Twenty-fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted him of three counts of armed robbery, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64, and which sentenced him to an enhanced sentence of 49 1/2 years' imprisonment at hard labor on count one, in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, and 22 years on the other two counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that counsel was ineffective for failing to request a jury instruction as to accomplice testimony; the evidence presented at trial materially corroborated the accomplice testimony, so a &quot;great caution&quot; instruction was not required. The record supported the sentence imposed because defendant, a second felony offender, and his two accomplices, targeted and robbed the owner and clients of a business and acted without provocation; in committing the robbery, the perpetrators engaged in a physical struggle with at least one of the victims and held the victims at gunpoint, bound them with duct tape, took their cell phones and money and emptied the studio of equipment, and used one of the victim's vehicles as a getaway car. The perpetrators' use of firearms created a risk of death or great bodily harm. Defendant failed to clearly and convincingly show that the mandatory minimum sentence for him as a second felony offender was excessive. The court found error patent, however, because defendant's sentences for armed robbery were considered indeterminate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of conviction but vacated the sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana), which adjudicated him as a habitual offender for his convictions for theft of a firearm, a violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court based its adjudication of defendant as a third felony habitual offender on the factual conclusion that the state had established that defendant was the same individual who had been convicted of the predicate offenses of armed robbery, first degree robbery and that he was the same individual who had been convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The appellate court affirmed, finding that defendant had to argue to the supreme court that he did not have fair notice that his sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon was subject to enhancement under the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. The state did not improperly use the same predicate offenses to establish he was an habitual offender that it used to establish that he was a convicted felon in possession of a firearm; the only predicate offense used to support defendant's conviction on that charge was his 2002 conviction for first degree robbery. Defendant's speedy trial rights had not been violated. The sentence imposed was not excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the adjudication and sentence, but it remanded the matter for correction of the trial court minutes of the adjudication proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The State admitted that it was the employer of the employee and the co-employee. The employee argued that the trial court erred in finding that a Louisiana state employee has no rights under the Jones Act or general maritime law to sue his employer, and that workers' compensation was the exclusive remedy. The court agreed. Also, the State had waived its sovereign immunity. under La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10(A).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, a reasonable juror could readily have concluded that defendant was a principal to the robbery and kidnapping of the victim. Defendant's actions preceding and during the offense pointed directly to her knowing and voluntary participation in both crimes. Although she was not armed and said nothing during the robbery, she was in the immediate proximity of the vehicle when the robbery took place and voiced no concern over her boyfriend's actions. Further, although defendant was out of sight when the victim was tied up and put in the trunk, a reasonable juror could also have concluded that it was defendant who backed the automobile into the driveway from the street, thereby facilitating the kidnapping. Second, defendant failed to demonstrate that she was unable to obtain a fair and impartial jury through the use of careful voir dire examination. Finally, defendant's midrange sentence of forty years without benefit of parole was neither grossly disproportionate to the crime nor a needless imposition of pain and suffering. Likewise, defendant's seven year sentence for simple robbery was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

Instead, it found that a Sibley hearing was warranted for the purpose of placing into evidence the necessary testimony, documents, and other evidence to permit the trial court to determine whether the proper parties plaintiff were before the court, whether a medical insurance crisis existed when &sect; 9:5628 was enacted, and if the patient's disease was one of the 19 diseases with latency periods in excess of three years.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile appealed a judgment of the Juvenile Court for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, which adjudicated her delinquent on the charge of illegal carrying of a weapon in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95. She argued that &sect; 14:95 was unconstitutional, that the evidence was insufficient, and that the juvenile court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer at a high school observed the juvenile and two other young women walk onto the high school's property. They were not wearing school uniforms, as was required of all students. The officer asked the three for identification; the two others produced identification but the juvenile said she did not have any. She opened her purse to show she did not have identification, and the officer looked into her purse and saw a knife. The court held that the motion to suppress was properly denied. The officer had reasonable suspicion that the juvenile was trespassing on school property; then the juvenile voluntarily opened her large purse and revealed a knife in plain view. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to show that the manner in which the juvenile carried the knife in her purse evinced intent to conceal the knife's identity in violation of &sect; 14:95. The court rejected the juvenile's contention that the language in the statute that it must be &quot;probable&quot; that she was going to use the knife as a dangerous weapon allowed proof of intent by a preponderance of evidence. The intent element was required to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury in the 21st Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of Livingston, Louisiana, of distribution of cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967A(1). He was sentenced to thirty years at hard labor, with the first two years of the sentence without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A drug enforcement agent saw defendant riding a bicycle and held up four fingers, signaling he wanted to buy $ 40 worth of crack cocaine. They met at a bar and defendant placed crack cocaine on the hood of the undercover vehicle. The agent put $ 40 on the ground, as instructed by defendant, and secured the cocaine. Defendant argued that the State failed to prove all of the elements of the offense, alleging that the State's use of a scientific analysis report to establish that the substance distributed was cocaine violated his right to confrontation, U.S. Const. amend. VI. Four months prior to trial, the State filed a notice of intent to introduce a scientific analysis report at trial, attaching a copy of the report to the notice. The report was made in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:499 and indicated that the evidence was determined to contain cocaine. The court held that admission of the scientific analysis report did not violate defendant's confrontation clause rights. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:501 was precisely the kind of &quot;notice-and-demand&quot; statute that the U.S. Supreme Court in Melendez-Diaz recognized as permissible under the Confrontation Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his mandatory sentence of life in prison without probation or parole imposed by the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1(B) following a less-than-unanimous jury verdict that defendant was guilty of second degree murder of a one-year-old boy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's argument that the jury should not have been informed about his plea of guilty four years before the death of the one-year-old boy to a charge of cruelty to his seven-month-old daughter. Evidence of defendant's acknowledged prior act of cruelty to his daughter while maintaining that any harm was accidental was admissible for the purpose of demonstrating the absence of accident regarding the boy. Medical testimony that the boy's death was caused by intentional acts of cruelty, defendant's admission of &quot;play-boxing&quot; with the child, his past act of cruel treatment of his own daughter, and the fact that he was the last person to see the boy alive tended to discount any reasonable hypothesis of innocence. Controlling authority provided that the twelve-person jury's verdict did not have to be unanimous, and defendant's conviction thus was affirmed. However, the district court should have considered defendant's claim that his mandatory life sentence was unconstitutionally excessive under the circumstances of his case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but remanded the matter to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on defendant's claim that his mandatory life sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' sought review of a finding in favor of defendants in plaintiffs' medical-malpractice action stemming from their daughter's amputation of her leg. The dismissal on the State's motion for summary judgment of plaintiffs' constitutional challenge under the Malpractice Liability for State Services Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39 et seq., was proper because the caps were constitutional. Further, the trial court did not err in finding that plaintiffs' recovery was limited to a single medical malpractice cap. The patient suffered one devastating and life-changing injury, the loss of her leg, a loss to which the jury found the negligence of her three surgeons contributed. The suggestion that the statutory cap was to be applied &quot;per plaintiff&quot; rather than &quot;per patient&quot; was rejected. Thus, there was no error in the deletion of the jury's awards of loss of consortium damages to the parents. Because the judgment did not apply the fault apportionment to the award of past medical expenses, which were not covered by the statutory cap, the judgment was amended to conform to the jury's allocation of 60 percent fault to the doctors, the patient's orthopedic surgeons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court amended the judgment to apply the jury's fault apportionment to the award of past medical expenses and affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 40:2203.1, the insurers appealed a judgment of the Fourteenth Judicial District Court (Louisiana), which granted the providers' motion for partial summary judgment, awarded statutory damages, and denied the insurer's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The providers alleged that the insurers routinely reimbursed them in workers' compensation cases at lower contracted rates, rather than at the higher mandated workers' compensation rates, thereby violating &sect; 40:2203.1 by failing to provide them with prior notice of their intent to reimburse at those rates. The trial court granted the providers' motion for partial summary judgment and awarded statutory damages. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that while the law of another state may have applied to the contract in general, it could not be used to circumvent the notice requirement. There was no error in the trial court's determination that a ten-year prescriptive period applied to the action. The insurer failed to carry its burden of proving that there was any genuine issue of material fact in dispute or that it could present evidence sufficient to rebut the providers' prima facie case. The trial court did not err in designating the damages portion of its judgment as final.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the evidence supported the conviction. After he received his Miranda warnings, defendant confessed that he shot the victim at close range. Eyewitnesses confirmed that fact. The victim died from the gunshot wounds. Defendant confronted the victim to settle the tensions that were mounting for weeks, while armed with a pistol. Any threatening text messages sent to defendant by the victim did not prove provocation. There were no mitigating factors for manslaughter. A photograph showing a frontal view of the victim and the bullet wounds, and a photograph taken from the victim's back showing bullet wounds were admissible as they were introduced to establish the victim's identity, and the location, severity, and number of wounds, and to corroborate evidence as to the manner of death. A proper foundation under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:450 was laid for the admission of the tape of defendant's confession. The sentence did not shock the sense of justice in light of the crime committed and the likely risk of harm to others who did not get along with defendant. There was no error patent under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of the decision of the Criminal District Court Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which granted two defendants' motions to quash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose out of a shooting. The State argued that the district court abused its discretion in holding that the first defendant could go free without having been tried and that the district court abused its discretion in granting the motion to quash filed by the second defendant on constitutional grounds. The first defendant argued in his writ application that the district court erred in its failure to bring him to trial in excess of eight years, thereby constituting a violation of the time limitations for the commencement of trial. The appellate court reversed its prior affirmation of the granting of the motions to quash the indictments and remanded. The appellate court was unable to say that the State was responsible for the delay by taking a codefendant to trial first. While the decision to try the codefendant first initiated the snowballing effect for the delay, and the delay was further precipitated by Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, there must be some additional showing that the State did more to hinder defendants' trial. To quash the indictment as to the two defendants when the basis was that not only the State was responsible, constituted clear error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the granting of the motions to quash filed by defendants, remanded the matter to the district court to reinstate the charges of second-degree murder, and ordered the district court to commence the trials of defendants within 45 days. Further, the district court was ordered to court conduct a bond hearing on the amended charge of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action brought under the Preferred Provider Organization Act (PPOA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2201, et seq., by plaintiff healthcare providers, defendant preferred provider organizations (PPOs), appealed a judgment of the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), which granted summary judgment to the healthcare providers for the minimum amount of damages mandated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2203.1(G).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The healthcare providers alleged that the PPOs entered into contracts with them that allowed the PPOs' clients to pay a discounted rate for health care services. They alleged that the PPOs routinely reimbursed them in workers' compensation cases at the lower contracted rates, rather than at the higher mandated workers' compensation rates, thereby violating the provisions of &sect; 40:2203.1 by failing to provide them with prior notice of their intent to reimburse at the PPO rates. The healthcare providers filed a summary judgment motion seeking payment of the minimum amount of damages mandated by &sect; 40:2203.1(G) for each violation, which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The PPOs failed to show that the trial court was divested of jurisdiction prior to the hearing on the motions for summary judgment by the grant of a motion for appeal of its motion to decertify the class. The choice of law provision found in the contract did not circumvent the state's interest in the notice requirements of the PPOA. the trial court correctly found that the prescriptive period applicable to an action for violation of the notice requirements of &sect; 40:2203.1 was ten years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Regarding attempted aggravated assault upon a police officer with a firearm, defendant was sentenced to the maximum penalty. He was fleeing from the police and assaulted the officer with a firearm and continued to evade authorities to escape apprehension. The court held that a trial court had broad discretion when imposing a sentence. On appellate review, the relevant question was not whether another sentence might have been more appropriate but whether the trial court abused its broad sentencing discretion. An appellate court had to determine whether the trial court adequately complied with the statutory guidelines in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, as well as whether the facts of the case warranted the sentence imposed. Where the statute provided for a mandatory sentence, it was an exercise in futility for the trial court to enumerate its reasons. Where defendant was convicted of two different crimes against two different victims, aggravated battery was plainly a separate crime from the first and defendant failed to establish that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering that he serve his sentences consecutively pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 883.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's pro se assignment of error that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. Defendant held what the victim thought was a knife to the victim's throat and then drove away in the victim's car, and a view of that evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution supported the jury's finding that the essential elements of the crime of first degree robbery were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also rejected defendant's claim in his attorney-filed brief that his sentence was excessive given his upbringing in the foster care system and minimal education and his relative youth, drug addiction, and lack of job skills. The sentence of 15 years was within the 3 to 40 year range of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:46.1(B) and was within the trial court's discretion, considering defendant's extensive criminal history and his use of an actual weapon in the offense, the danger of defendant committing further offenses upon his release, and defendant's failure to attempt to obtain employment prior to the offense. His sentence was less than the penalty imposed in another case with less aggravating circumstances and more mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:4 and 14:44.1 respectively. Defendant sought review of sentences by the Twenty-fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which imposed four 30-year concurrent sentences as a result of his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a co-defendant robbed three victims while armed with a firearm in three separate instances. They also committed the second degree kidnapping of the third victim. The court held that the trial court did not err. During the plea colloquy, the trial court informed defendant that it would sentence him to no more than 30 years at hard labor on each count to run concurrently and explained that it would take testimony at the sentencing hearing. The trial court stated that defendant should not count on less than 30 years. Additionally, the guilty plea form stated that defendant was advised that there would be a cap of 30 years on each count. He indicated that he understood by writing his initials next to that statement. Because those sentences were imposed in conformity with the plea agreement which was set forth in the record at the time of the plea, defendant could not seek review of them under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.2, even though they involved sentencing caps. The court also held that trial counsel's failure to file a motion to reconsider the sentence would not prejudice defendant by denying him such review. No errors patent required corrective action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), convicting him, on a jury's verdict, of fifth offense driving while intoxicated (DWI), in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98(A), (E), and sentencing him to 20 years imprisonment at hard labor to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension, and to run concurrently with a sentence in another case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of fifth offense driving while intoxicated. At the time of his arrest, defendant was asleep in his vehicle with the motor running and the vehicle in drive, but the vehicle was not moving. The total circumstances showed sufficient physical handling of the controls of the car by defendant and a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was operating the vehicle. Next, the trial court did not err in denying his motion to quash the bill of information. Defendant's prior non-jury DWI misdemeanor convictions were properly used as predicates to enhance the felony DWI sentence, although first and second offense DWI offenders did not have a right to a jury trial. Finally, the twenty year sentence imposed by the trial court was constitutionally excessive after considering the nature of the instant crime, the nature and background of defendant, and similar cases where no one was injured and there was no accident as a result of defendant's intoxication. Accordingly, the court reduced the term to ten years without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction. It amended the sentence by reducing the term to ten years imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. It affirmed the sentence as amended. The court remanded the matter and ordered the trial court to correct the commitment to reflect that the sentence was to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Twenty-Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Charles (Louisiana) convicting him of distribution of heroin, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966A, and sentencing him to 20 years. After the denial of his motion to reconsider sentence, the trial court granted his motion for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The failure to file a motion to reconsider sentence or to state the specific grounds on which the motion was based limited defendant to a review of the sentence for constitutional excessiveness only. The U.S. Const. amend. VIII and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 prohibited the imposition of excessive punishment. A sentence was considered excessive if it was grossly disproportionate to the offense. At the time of sentencing, the trial court had before it a pre-sentence investigation report. The report showed that defendant was a third felony offender and defendant admitted to being a heroin addict. He only attended treatment once, in compliance with a court order. He did not follow the program. The report indicated that defendant refused to accept responsibility for any of his offenses. The recommendation of the Department of Corrections was that defendant be multiple billed as a third offender, and that he be sentenced to a term of no less than 25 years. Based on defendant's extensive criminal history, his refusal to cooperate with drug treatment, and the seriousness of the offense, there was no abuse of discretion in sentencing defendant to 20 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six criminal defendants had been determined to be permanently incompetent to stand trial for the foreseeable future and a danger to themselves or others. All six  were committed pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 648(B)(3) prior to its revision in 2008. The amendment required that an incompetent defendant could only be held for a reasonable time; after that, if his competency was not restored, he had to be civilly committed. In their writ application, defendants argued that the 2008 amendment was retroactive. The court held that in absence of contrary legislative expression, substantive laws applied prospectively only. Procedural and interpretative laws applied both prospectively and retroactively, unless there was a legislative expression to the contrary. While there was no legislative expression as to retroactive application, the court held that the amendment created a procedural mechanism to be used if a trial court determined that an incompetent defendant was unlikely in the foreseeable future to be capable of standing trial and found the amendment to be retroactive.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:154.2. The federation challenged a judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, which granted the school board's exception of no right of action and dismissed it as a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers sought a declaratory judgment as to whether they were entitled to additional compensation after the school board increased the length of their school day. The federal joined the lawsuit as an association representing other teachers employed by the school board. The school board argued that the federation had no real or actual interest in the proceedings. The court of appeal held that the federation had associational standing to bring the action against the school board on behalf of its members. The teachers, as well as other members of the federation, had standing to sue in their own right. The federation's interests were consistent with the suit. The goal of the federation was no different than most unions and other employee organizations, which was to ensure fair and accurate wages for all of its members. The relief the federation and teachers sought was a declaration pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1871 of whether or not the teachers were entitled to additional compensation pursuant to &sect;17:154.2. The relief requested was not specific to any individual party but merely a clarification of rights for all teachers employed by the school board.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), for violation of La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Washington's statute under which he was convicted as a sex offender, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.040, was not equivalent to Louisiana sex offender statutes because the age limit for a juvenile victim under the Washington statute was eighteen while the age limit under the Louisiana statutes was seventeen. The court rejected defendant's argument given common legislative intent in Washington and Louisiana to criminalize exploitation of children. The court observed that despite difficulties that followed a hurricane, persons other than defendant who moved to Louisiana were able to follow requirements for registering as sex offenders. Also, while defendant contended that his efforts to register showed he had no intent not to register and that &sect; 15:542 was unconstitutional for not containing a criminal intent element, the court held that certain conduct was criminal even in the absence of criminal intent and that the statute was constitutional. The court concluded that the trial court erred only in failing to impose a fine on defendant that was mandatory under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:542.1.4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but vacated his sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing to include a mandatory fine on defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court afffirmed the judgment. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:41B provided that emission was not necessary and any sexual penetration, however slight, was sufficient to complete the crime; thus, the lack of physical evidence did not preclude the commission of the crime. Defendant's right to confrontation was not violated by the use of a taped interview of the six-year-old victim because all parties were available for cross-examination and because the victim was, in fact, cross-examined. The court declined to address the facial validity of La. Child. Code Ann. art. 325, 327 because they concerned the nature of the evidence admitted at trial and, therefore, an objection was necessary to preserve the issue for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to sentencing defendant to 30 days, the trial court ordered that he be held under an Immigration and Naturalization Service detainer. Defendant challenged &sect; 14:100.13, arguing that it was federal preempted, it violated equal protection principles, it was void for vagueness, and he was subject to cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that &sect; 14:100.13 was not federally preempted as it was a valid exercise of the state's police power to regulate public roads. Defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of racial discrimination or raise an inference of such discrimination to support a finding that the Equal Protection Clause or the Fourth Amendment had been violated. Section 14: 100.13 was not void for vagueness as the conduct proscribed was unambiguous. Section 14:100.13 imposed no mandatory minimum prison sentence or fine. While the reporting requirement could trigger deportation, the sentencing provision of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:100.11 was not unconstitutionally excessive.

The trial court granted the Department's exception of no right of action, arguing that the parent was not the taxpayer and was therefore not entitled to seek a refund of tax money.

The Department argued that because the parent was not itself the taxpayer, it did not have the right to seek a refund. The parent then alleged that it was the agent of the two subsidiaries and was bringing its action on their behalf pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 694. The Department argued that the subsidiaries, the actual taxpayers, did not personally protest the tax payments as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1576. The court held that the parent satisfied the prerequisites of &sect; 47:1576, inasmuch as the payments were made, notice was given to the Department that the payments were protested, and the suit against the proper party was timely filed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), convicting him, upon a jury's verdict, of terrorizing, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:40.1, and sentencing him to serve 12 years in the custody of the Department of Corrections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made calls to a corporation's customer service department and spoke to representatives in Mexico and Florida. He became very angry and threatened to blow up a repair facility in Texas. The evidence was sufficient to show that defendant intentionally communicated information to representatives that the commission of a violent crime was imminent, or that a circumstance dangerous to human life was about to exist. Further, the evidence was sufficient to find that defendant had the specific intent to cause members of the general public to be in sustained fear for their safety. The customer service agent felt fear, alarm, or agitation of danger. She immediately contacted her supervisor, who alerted other personnel of the threats. Also, the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant had the specific intent to cause the evacuation of a building and a serious disruption to the general public. Next, defendant's sentence was less than the maximum and no fine was imposed. Further, defendant had an extensive criminal history. Therefore, defendant's sentence was not constitutionally excessive. Finally, there was no merit to defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800.51 et seq., against defendants, a manufacturer and a tire service company. The driver's employer and its compensation insurer intervened. The First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) entered judgment on a jury's verdict in favor of the manufacturer. The driver and the intervenors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approximately two weeks after a tire was retreaded, a zipper rupture occurred in the tire. The pressure from the rupture knocked the truck driver to the ground, causing him to sustain serious injuries. The jury was not manifestly erroneous in concluding that the tire did not contain a defect that rendered it unreasonably dangerous in construction or composition, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800.55, where defense experts opined that the rupture was caused by under-inflation. The jury was entitled to credit the defense experts' opinions over the truck driver's evidence. Further, the manufacturer's motion for directed verdict was properly granted with regard to the manufacturer's alleged failure to conform to an express warranty, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800.58, because there were no promises or guarantees contained in the data sheet with regard to the life of a retreaded tire. Additionally, the manufacturer's motion for directed verdict was properly granted with regard to the manufacturer's alleged failure to warn, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800.57(A), because there was no admissible evidence concerning the manufacturer's failure to warn consumers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town clerk filed suit against defendant town mayor in the Sixth Judicial District Court, Parish of Tensas, Louisiana, seeking to prohibit the mayor from interfering with the clerk's job duties and compensation. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction forbidding the mayor from taking any action that would upset the status quo of the clerk's job duties and employment. The mayor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clerk alleged that disagreements arose between her, the mayor, and the police chief over the processing of speeding tickets and the withholding of out-of-state drivers' licenses from ticketed drivers. The mayor reduced her duties and pay and minimized her authority. The court held that the appeal was timely under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. arts. 3612(C) and 2087 because the filing of the signed judgment into the suit record occurred within 15 days of the mayor's motion for appeal. The mayor argued that the injunction impinged upon his statutory duty to supervise the town clerk under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:404. The court concluded that the mayor's actions extended well beyond his general powers of supervision and direction of the administration of the municipality's affairs, so that the clerk's defined duties owed to the municipality (such as those under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:422, 33:381, 33:406, and 33:421) were violated. The balance between the mayoral power and the clerk's duties was required to be kept unless the mayor and aldermen agreed to the clerk's removal as required under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:386(A) and 33:404(A)(3).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, including the daughter, the estate and the grandchildren of a tort victim, filed a petition for wrongful death and survival action damages.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tort victim died after tripping over uneven flooring at branch of the bank. The court affirmed dismissal of claims of the grandchildren and the estate because Louisiana's survival and wrongful death causes of action, found in La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.1 and La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.2, provided rights only to specified survivors that included the surviving spouse, children, parents, grandparents, and siblings of the deceased. Rights provided by survival and wrongful death causes of action thus passed only to survivors of the tort victim in the statutory order of exclusionary preference and not in an inheritance sense or through the victim's succession. The court also held that the statutes did not violate equal protection rights under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The legislature had to place some limit on the statutory causes of action, and persons in addition to grandchildren who lived with or were supported by tort victims, such as foster children or unmarried partners, were similarly excluded. The legislature chose to provide relief to those most affected by the death of a tort victim while providing a reasonably appropriate limitation on such rights of action.</SPAN></P>

The Office of Workers' Compensation, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana), found the employers and the insurer jointly liable for benefits, penalties, and attorney fees. It ordered indemnification under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1063. The statutory employer and the insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured when he fell from a roof while performing roofing work for his direct employer. The insurer denied coverage, asserting that the direct employer failed to pay its premium. The claimant alleged that the statutory employer had a contract for repair work and that the direct employer was performing as a subcontractor. The statutory employer denied that relationship, and asserted that the claimant was not liable for benefits because he was an undocumented worker, having remained in the country after the expiration of a work visa. However, the claimant was a statutory employee under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1061, and the statutory employer failed to meet its burden of showing the application of some specific exclusion under which benefits could have been denied. Further, the workers' compensation judge correctly determined that the Office of Workers' Compensation lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the contractual indemnification claim, and properly granted the statutory indemnification claim pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1063. Finally, the record supported the determination that the insurer failed to prove the effective termination of the policy.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court refused to consider that portion of the judgment denying the alternative writ of mandamus, which was actually a request for a review of the withholding of the retail alcoholic beverage permit. The applicant contended that an ordinance requiring written consent of adjacent property owners before an alcoholic beverage permit could be issued in a residential area was unlawful and unconstitutional. The parties stipulated that the applicant's premises were located in a mixed-use area, conceding that the area included some residential use. The parish council's construction of the ordinance to include the mixed-use area as a residential area was a common sense one that was reasonable. The council had authority to enact the ordinance from the provisions of its Home Rule Charter, pursuant to La. Const. Art. VI, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court refused to review the portion of the judgment denying the writ of mandamus. The court affirmed the denial of the applicant's request for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an intestate decedent's illegitimate children, filed a petition in the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, seeking to annul and vacate a judgment of possession of the decedent's estate in favor of defendants, the decedent's siblings. The siblings filed a peremptory exception of prescription, which the trial court granted. The children appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were born to the decedent and their mother during an 11-year-period, 1950 to 1961, in which decedent and the mother resided together unmarried. The decedent died intestate in 1977, never having formally acknowledged the children. In 1977, children born outside of marriage could not inherit from the intestate estate of an alleged father if there was a legitimate relative, and the siblings received the decedent's estate. Then, La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 208 and 209 were revised to allow such children to inherit. Unacknowledged or informally acknowledged children born outside of marriage who had already attained the age of 19, or whose alleged parent was already deceased, could bring a civil proceeding to prove their filiation, but such an action had to be brought prior to September 12, 1982, which the children did not do. They argued that they should be allowed to prove paternity by showing that the mother lived in a state of concubinage with the father when the child was conceived. The court held that such evidence was relevant, but would have had to have been presented during a civil proceeding brought during the grace period accorded to the children by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting the siblings' peremptory exception of prescription.</SPAN></P>

A sexual assault kit was subsequently performed and the presence of defendant's DNA in the victim's vaginal vault established that penetration occurred. The second victim was deceased at the time of trial, but the evidence indicated that she was 89 years old at the time of the rape. A sexual assault kit was performed on this victim and defendant's DNA was matched to the cuttings taken from her gown. The third victim was also 89 years old at the time of the rape and defendant's DNA was matched to the samples taken from that victim's vaginal vault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a judge in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, of simple robbery, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:65. The trial judge sentenced defendant to seven years' imprisonment at hard labor, with credit for time served. On appeal, he argued that he received an excessive sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, age 23, admitted that he and two friends saw the victim, an elderly gentleman who owned a bar, leave a bank with a bag that they guessed contained money. They followed him in their car, and when he exited his car, defendant jumped on him, knocked him to the ground, and wrestled the bag from him. When a witness tried to intervene, one of the friends got out of the car and threatened him with a knife. The court held that the sentence was not constitutionally excessive. In factually similar cases, other courts had held that the imposition of the maximum sentence for simple robbery was not constitutionally excessive. Defendant acted without provocation and, in committing the robbery, knocked the elderly victim to the ground, causing minor physical injuries. The co-defendant's approach with a knife created a risk of death or great bodily harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sentence but remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to inform defendant of the prescriptive period for seeking post-conviction relief in writing and to correct the commitment to reflect that (1) defendant was not informed of the prescriptive period for seeking post-conviction relief, and that (2) the original charge against defendant was not amended.</SPAN></P>

There was no testimony that the victim lost consciousness and no evidence of disfigurement or permanent disability; protracted loss or impairment of the function of a member, organ, or mental faculty; or a substantial risk of death. Therefore, the State was required to prove that the victim suffered extreme physical pain. But, the victim was not asked about her injuries and, although she sought medical treatment, no medical evidence was submitted. Thus, the State failed to prove that the victim suffered extreme physical. However, a conviction for simple battery under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:35 was proper because no evidence even remotely suggested that the victim consented to the attack.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CONVICTIONS AFFIRMED. SENTENCE FOR AGGRAVATED BURGLARY AFFIRMED. SENTENCE FOR AGGRAVATED RAPE AFFIRMED AS AMENDED. REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Thirty Sixth Judicial District Court, Parish of Beauregard (Louisiana), convicting him of aggravated burglary, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:60, and aggravated rape, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62, and sentencing him to life imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence for the rape and 30 years imprisonment at hard labor for the burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, there was no double jeopardy because the crimes of aggravated rape and aggravated battery were separate and distinct offenses. Further, separate and distinct evidence was presented for both crimes. Defendant could have been convicted of aggravated burglary without proof that any rape occurred, considering that he committed battery upon the victim after he forcibly gained entrance into the house. Second, the trial court considered appropriate factors and particularized its reasons for imposing consecutive sentences. It was persuaded to impose consecutive sentences in light of defendant's extensive criminal history, persistence in committing sex offenses, and ineffectiveness of previous leniency by the courts in persuading defendant to cease his criminal behavior. Third, because life imprisonment was not a sentence for a stated number of years or months, the trial court lacked authority to deny eligibility for diminution of the aggravated rape sentence pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 890.1. Finally, the record supported the trial court's determination that the probative nature of other crimes evidence substantially outweighed any risk of unfair prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and the sentence for aggravated burglary. It amended the aggravated rape sentence by deleting the portion denying diminution of sentence, and it affirmed the sentence as amended. The court remanded the matter to the trial court for the limited purpose of noting the amendment to defendant's sentence for aggravated rape in the minutes.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2500(D). The appellate court ordered that the firefighter be reinstated to his former position and that he be paid back pay from the time of his illegal termination. The board's record contained no evidence that the municipality complied with its affirmative duty as delineated in &sect; 33:2500(D). As such, the municipality was in legal bad faith when the firefighter did not receive a written statement of his termination and reasons therefor, and the board's affirmation of the termination without the required written statement was unreasonable, as their decision had no basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Thirtieth Judicial District Court, Parish of Vernon (Louisiana), defendant was found guilty on two counts of first degree murder, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence on each count, to run consecutively. A motion for appeal was iled and granted. Defendant asserted numerous assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assignments of error failed. Defendant was not faced with the prospect of the death penalty, nor was he prejudiced by not being afforded a jury trial. Conversely, it was by his request that he was given a bench trial. The trial court heard a codefendant's testimony and defendant's argument that the codefendant committed the offenses. The trial court chose to believe defendant committed the offenses. Defendant used deadly force against an unarmed victim who had his face and arm reconstructed and whose arm was in a cast. Thus, the trial court could rationally have concluded that defendant did not act in self-defense, that his actions were not justified, and his response was excessive. The warrant at issue was signed at 9:49 p.m. and executed that night. Further, at trial, a detective testified that it was not clear whether he could search defendant's residence at night. Based on this information, the police were acting in good faith when they executed the search warrant at night. Although defendant alleged he was denied adequate development of his defense, he failed to prove that his defense was actually altered or that he was denied any funding that was requested.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for first degree murder were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State filed a petition for forfeiture under the Seizure and Controlled Dangerous Substances Property Forfeiture Act of 1989, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:2601-40:2622, and an exception of no cause of action, alleging that defendant driver's claim that his property was not subject to forfeiture was untimely. The driver challenged an order of the 22nd Judicial District Court Parish of St. Tammany, Louisiana, which dismissed his claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state police trooper pulled over the driver's vehicle for improper lane usage, searched the vehicle, and found $ 46,750. The driver could not satisfactorily explain the origin of the money, and it was seized pending forfeiture. The court of appeal held that there was no defect in the service of the notice of pending forfeiture on the driver. The Act allowed personal service of the notice, and the driver was personally served by the designated law enforcement agent in accord with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:2607(B)(2) and 2608(3)(a). The trial court erred in sustaining the State's exception of no cause of action. The driver's claim clearly stated a cause of action for the return of the money. However, his claim that his property was not subject to seizure and forfeiture was untimely, rendering it invalid under the Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2610. The State demonstrated by some credible evidence that the money was probably drug related. The money had the distinct odor of marijuana, and the driver could not explain its origin. Therefore, the State satisfied its burden of establishing probable cause for the forfeiture of the funds under the Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2615(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal affirmed the judgment dismissing the driver's claim and ordering forfeiture of the money.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 45:1361-1378, declared unconstitutional. Two cable companies intervened on the side of defendants.

The corporations argued that &sect; 45:1365B violated La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 15, by releasing incumbent service providers from obligations owed to local governmental subdivisions under existing franchise agreements. Art. VII, &sect; 15, provided that the legislature could not release, extinguish, or authorize the releasing or extinguishing of any indebtedness, liability, or obligation to the state, a parish, or a municipality. The court held that art. VII, &sect; 15 did not deny the legislature the power to release future obligations owed to municipalities such as local governments affected by the Act. The constitutional issue would arise only if a statute released obligations due and owing prior to the enactment of the statute. The legislature specifically considered and clearly provided that the Act was not intended to release existing obligations at the time that an incumbent service provider exercised its opt-in rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1. He filed a motion to sever the counts, arguing that if the counts were tried together, the jury would have been unduly influenced by the State suggesting that he was a dangerous man in possession of a firearm. However, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion because defendant failed to show that the jurors would have been confused by the presentation of the evidence, that they could not have segregated evidence as to the two counts, or that he was prejudiced by the joinder of offenses. Next, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion in limine requesting to stipulate to his prior conviction. Proof of the prior specifically enumerated felony conviction was an essential element pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1, and the State was entitled to produce evidence of the name and nature of the prior conviction. Finally, La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17(A) and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 782(A) were not unconstitutional and, hence, not violative of defendant's U.S. Const. amend. VI right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

Defendant maintained that the trial court improperly imposed a maximum sentence on the basis he failed to appear for sentencing. Defendant contended he was not the worst offender and, therefore, a maximum sentence was not warranted. The State contended that defendant was precluded from raising the excessiveness of his sentence because it was imposed pursuant to a plea agreement. The instant court found that defendant was precluded from challenging the excessiveness of his sentence on appeal because his sentence was imposed in conformity with a plea agreement that was set forth in the record at the time of the plea. The trial court warned defendant in open court that if he failed to appear he would not receive the 10-year sentence with a boot camp recommendation, but rather he would face a possible maximum sentence. Defendant failed to appear for sentencing, and as a result, he received the maximum 30-year sentence. Defendant was clearly informed of the two possible sentences, which were dictated by his actions, when he entered his plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, each defendant was charged with violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(E), second or third offense possession of marijuana. Each defendant sought review of the Criminal District Court Orleans Parish (Louisiana)'s denial of a motion to quash the charge based on a claim that the enhancement of the charge was unconstitutional because it used at least one prior misdemeanor conviction for which a jury trial was not available.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the trial court in each case rejected the argument, a different section of criminal district court found that the argument had merit and held that &sect; 40:966(E) was unconstitutional. The supreme court subsequently reversed that ruling, denied certification, and remanded the cases for consideration. It held that &sect; 40:966(E)(2) did not suffer from a constitutional infirmity. U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV did not preclude the sentence-enhancing use of a prior valid, fair, and reliable adult misdemeanor conviction, where the misdemeanor proceeding included all the applicable constitutional protections, even though those protections did not include the right to trial by jury. Reliability was the sine qua non for use of prior convictions to enhance a sentence under the prior conviction exception, and not the right to a jury trial. Louisiana's statutory scheme satisfied the requirement of due process because under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, states were allowed the presumption that in petty crimes and offenses, trial judges were capable of reliable fact finding. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendants' motions to quash.</SPAN></P>

Defendant indicated that he was satisfied with the representation of his attorney. He stated that he had not been forced, coerced, or threatened to enter his guilty plea. Defendant was advised that he faced a possible sentencing range of up to 40 years imprisonment at hard labor, and was told that the sentence he would receive would be 40 years imprisonment at hard labor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), convicting him of aggravated incest in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:78.1, sentencing him to 15 years at hard labor, and imposing a fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for specific performance of an alleged plea bargain. He claimed there was an agreement between himself, his counsel, the prosecutor and the trial judge, that he would receive a five-year probated sentence in exchange for his guilty plea. The trial court denied the motion stating that the waiver of rights form indicated that the sentence would be determined and there was no mention of probation or any determined sentence. Additionally, defendant did not object to his sentence at the time it was imposed. Defendant failed to carry his burden of showing there was an agreement between him and the State regarding a probated sentence and, thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for specific performance of a plea bargain. Defendant next claimed that his sentence was constitutionally excessive. Considering the  jurisprudence and the circumstances of the case, including the repeated incidents of the crime upon defendant's step-daughter over a three-year period and defendant's lack of remorse, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. It affirmed in part defenant's sentence, but vacated it as to the imposition of the sex offender treatment program. The court remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to correct the commitment to reflect the imposition of a fine on defendant and to transmit the amended minute entry to the officer in charge of the institution to which defendant had been sentenced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), finding him to be a fourth felony offender and sentencing him to life imprisonment in his habitual offender proceeding pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially convicted of attempted simple burglary of an inhabited dwelling, possession of hydrocodone, and possession of alprazolam. After defendant's convictions were affirmed on appeal, the State filed the habitual offender bill. The State sought to enhance defendant's sentence by producing evidence of seven prior convictions in which defendant pleaded guilty. The State proved defendant's identity in all of the predicate convictions, the existence of the predicate guilty pleas, and that defendant was represented by counsel. Defendant failed to meet his burden of producing some affirmative evidence of an infringement of his rights or of a procedural irregularity. The State showed that defendant was personally advised of his Boykin rights by the trial judge, and that he waived those rights. Boykin did not require the trial judge to advise defendant of the minimum and maximum sentence, or the possibility of the filing of a future habitual offender bill. While defendant received a double enhancement based on prior convictions for marijuana distribution and possession of a firearm as a felon, the State proved his status independent of either of those convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bienville, Louisiana, of possession of over 400 grams of cocaine in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F)(1)(c). He was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a car that was stopped for weaving. The driver and passenger gave inconsistent stories as to where they had been, and defendant acted nervous and told the officer that he was calling his &quot;legal people.&quot; The officer conducted a K-9 search of the vehicle; the search yielded nine pounds of cocaine. Defendant's fingerprint was found on one of the bags. Defendant argued that, because he was only a passenger and did not have any cocaine on his person, the single fingerprint was insufficient to support his conviction. The court held that the evidence, including evidence that defendant had driven the car and admitted loading the items in the trunk, was sufficient. The court held that the officers had grounds for a lawful traffic stop during which they were permitted to check the licenses of both the driver and passenger and call for the K-9 search. Although the admission of audio of the officers conducting a background check on defendant was error, the error was harmless. The trial judge erred in ordering that the entire 30-year sentence be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(G).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners challenged a judgment of the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which denied their request for a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining administrative proceedings brought against them by defendants, a city and a commission. They argued that New Orleans, La., Mun. Code &sect; 6-31 et seq., was unconstitutional, and the enforcement of city code violations rested exclusively with the city's municipal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission cited the owners' properties for violations of historic district ordinances. The court of appeal held that 1921 La. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 22(A) provided the authority for the city to create the Administrative Adjudication Bureau for Public Health, Housing and Environmental Violations, Department of Health (AAB) to adjudicate violations of its ordinances. La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 17 retained that authority for the commission. The creation of the AAB did not violate the city's home rule charter. The Louisiana Constitution, which retained the authority for the commission, and La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13:2575 empowered the city to enact ordinances and to exercise state police power in order to regulate the use of property situated within the commission for the purpose of historic preservation. The AAB did not have authority pursuant to &sect; 6-31 et seq. to adjudicate the violations alleged against the owners. The alleged violations did not fall within the purview of &quot;housing violations&quot; since they did not constitute a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare and/or to the environment. Jurisdiction for prosecuting the alleged violations existed only in the city's municipal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings, and upon remand, the owners were granted leave to amend their petition to seek appropriate relief. It affirmed the trial court's decision to deny the writ of preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant fled from the police when they approached to investigate what they believed to be a drug transaction and defendant discarded bags of marijuana and crack cocaine, packaged for distribution, while fleeing from the police. Additionally, items used in the packaging of drugs for distribution were found in the apartment where defendant's personal belongings were found. The photographic identification, even if suggestive, was reliable as there was no substantial likelihood of misidentification. Only minutes passed from the sergeant's encounter with the suspect and his identification of defendant from the photograph, and the sergeant's description matched defendant.

Physical evidence, including casings found under the street lamp where defendant was seen shooting his gun, further substantiated eyewitness testimony. The State additionally proved that defendant had the requisite specific intent under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:27 and 14:30 because the discharge of a firearm in the direction of a crowd of innocent bystanders was repeatedly been recognized as sufficient to prove specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm. His sentence was appropriate given the seriousness of his conduct, coupled with his proclivity for violence with firearms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner brought an action against defendant prison officials in the Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of Claiborne, Louisiana. The prisoner did not pay the filing fee as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1186(A)(2). The prisoner failed to pay fees and costs for more than three years, and the case was dismissed pursuant to &sect; 15:1186(B)(2)(c). The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1186(B)(2)(c), a provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), a civil action filed by a prisoner could be dismissed if the prisoner failed to pay the court costs or fees within three years from the date the costs or fees were incurred. The prisoner argued that &sect; 15:1186(B)(2)(c) violated the equal protection clause of the Louisiana Constitution and deprived him of his right to access of the courts under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The court held that neither indigents nor prisoners were suspect classes for equal protection purposes. Section 15:1186(B)(2)(c) clearly did not affect any fundamental right. Additionally, it was not discriminatory on the basis of any classification set forth in the equal protection clause of the Louisiana Constitution. Therefore, the statute merely had to be supported by a rational basis reasonably related to a legitimate governmental interest. The government had an interest in causing prisoners to weigh the decision to file lawsuits and in controlling its dockets. The provision was limited because it did not require the dismissal of all suits filed by prisoners, and thus, did not bar their access to the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court dismissing the prisoner's lawsuit without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), of attempted burglary, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:27, 14:62. The maximum sentence was six years under &sect; 14:27(D)(3). The district attorney alleged and proved that defendant was a quadruple offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. Defendant was then sentenced to 20 years at hard labor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the proof that defendant was a quadruple offender, the trial court had sentenced defendant to one year. The court held that defendant's 20-year sentence was presumptively constitutional. Defendant bore the burden of clearly and convincingly establishing the excessiveness of his sentence by showing factually that the imposition of the sentence amounted to nothing more than the purposeful imposition of pain and suffering and was grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime. No evidence was introduced in the district court in support of the claim of excessiveness of sentence, and the pre-sentence report was not included in the record on appeal. The court held that without the factual information in the pre-sentence report, it had no way of evaluating the reasonableness of the sentencing court imposing a sentence twenty times greater than the initial sentence. Defendant therefore failed to overcome the presumption that the sentence imposed upon him did not violate the proscriptions of the Eighth Amendment and of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. He challenged a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, State of Louisiana, which found that he was a third felony offender and sentenced him to 66 years imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by failing to find that the predicate convictions did not comply with the requirements of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 556.1. The court of appeal held that the predicate offenses were properly used to prove defendant's status as a multiple felony offender. In advising defendant of his constitutional right to confrontation codified in art. 556.1(A)(3), the trial court sufficiently apprised him of the encompassing rights under the Confrontation Clauses of the Sixth Amendment and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 to physically face those who testified against him and to conduct a cross-examination of those adverse witnesses. The State met the burden of proving the existence of defendant's guilty pleas and that he was represented by counsel when the guilty pleas were taken. Defendant failed to show either that his rights were infringed or that there was a procedural irregularity in his guilty pleas. Defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive sentence. Defendant received the mandatory minimum sentence, and the State proved that he used force or intimidation while armed with a dangerous weapon, which were elements of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal affirmed defendant's multiple offender enhanced sentence. It remanded remand the matter for correction of the multiple offender commitment/minute entry to reflect that defendant was not informed of his Boykin rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's suppression motion because it was reasonable for the arresting officers to suspect that a drug transaction had occurred and to initiate an investigatory stop.  Next, defendant was properly tried before a six person jury because the punishment for a conviction for possession of cocaine was not necessarily confinement at hard labor. Defendant's status as a habitual offender had no bearing on the size of the jury because the habitual offender proceeding was a separate proceeding applicable only after conviction and then at the discretion of the district attorney. Although the instant offense involved possession of only a single piece of crack cocaine, defendant failed to meet the burden of proving that a life sentence was unconstitutionally excessive because he had been convicted previously of eight felonies and three misdemeanors, including the crimes of violence of sexual battery and molestation of a juvenile. However, defendant's motion for a new trial was timely filed under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 853 and, therefore, he was entitled to remand for consideration of the motion.</SPAN></P>

Regardless, there were no facts in the record that individualized or particularized defendant or his circumstances. Thus, there was nothing substantive for the court to consider in determining whether the sentence was excessive. There was a discrepancy between the sentencing transcript and the minute entry in that the sentencing transcript failed to note that the sentence was to be served without benefit of parole as required under La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his three drug convictions, his original sentence, and the adjudication on a multiple offender bill and enhanced sentence. The appellate court affirmed however, stating that the denial of his motion for a continuance was appropriate. Defendant alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective. However, the instances in question occurred during trial, not prior to his request for a continuance to allow private counsel to prepare for trial. Defendant also had approximately two years between his arraignment and the date set for trial to retain the attorney of his choice, if he could manage to do so. There was no constitutional right to make a new choice of counsel on the date the trial was to begin, with the attendant necessity of a continuance and its disrupting implications to the orderly trial of cases. Further, in regard to his sentences, given the facts of the case and the fact that his enhanced sentence of 20 years was on the low end of the possible sentencing range, there was no error. Defendant committed three drug-related offense on the same day, sold drugs to an undercover officer, and had additional cocaine and marijuana found in his possession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), entered judgment convicting defendant of theft of goods, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67.10, and sentencing her as a habitual offender to 20 years imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. After her conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal, defendant filed pro se writ applications, which were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, defendant claimed error in the admission of certain testimony regarding a juicer. However, even defense counsel referred to the juicer and, thus, defendant waived the issue. Regardless, the jury did not hear testimony about the seizure of a juicer. Next, defendant argued that &sect; 14:67.10 was unconstitutional because it established different grades of penalties for the theft of goods from merchants than the general theft statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67, did for theft from other businesses and private persons. However, defendant did not raise the constitutionality issue in the trial court, so the issue was not preserved for review. Nonetheless, the appellate court noted that the argument also failed on the merits. Finally, defendant was not entitled to retroactive application of an amendment to the statute. Under the current version, defendant's crime would have been classified as a misdemeanor. However, the applicable sentencing scheme was the one in effect at the time the offense was committed. Defendant pointed to nothing in the enacting legislation or in the amended statute that indicated the new sentencing provisions should have been applied to her retrospectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the writ applications and affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which sentenced him as a second felony offender to 45 yeas imprisonment at hard labor, with the first five years to be served without benefits, upon his conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Originally, defendant was sentenced to 30 years without benefits. His original sentence was vacated and he was resentenced to 45 years without benefits as a habitual offender. On first appeal, defendant's conviction was affirmed, but the matter was remanded for rulings on defendant's two motions to reconsider sentence. On remand, the trial court denied both motions, but resentenced defendant by adding benefits after five years. Defendant did not file a motion to reconsider the resentence and, thus, appellate review of the enhanced sentence was limited to a review for constitutional excessiveness. The mid-range sentence was supported by comparison to similar cases and did not shock the sense of justice. Defendant had committed armed robberies as a juvenile and had a prior conviction for possession of cocaine. The trial judge imposed an illegally lenient enhanced resentence when he restricted benefits for only five years, but no corrective action was required because under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:301.1, the statutory requirement of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(G) that a habitual offender be sentenced without benefits was self-activating.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went into a known crack house for the purpose of purchasing crack cocaine. When defendant left, he had crack cocaine in his pants pocket. When an officer asked defendant what he had in his pocket, defendant attempted to discard the drugs. Thus, defendant claimed that he lacked intent to possess. However, defendant went to the house with the intent to obtain crack cocaine. Further, defendant's attempt to conceal, then discard, the illicit substance shows that he was aware of the nature of the substance. Next, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for mistrial. The trial court did not err in reminding the jurors that six votes for guilty were required to return a guilty verdict because the jury indicated it had a verdict although subsequent polling revealed it was an invalid verdict. The grand jury foreperson did not state the jury had been unable to reach a verdict. Next, defendant's sentence was not excessive because he had an extensive criminal history, and had been regularly engaging in the illegal possession of crack cocaine. Finally, defendant's ineffective assistance arguments were relegated to post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Iberia (Louisiana) imposing concurrent sentences for convictions of possession with intent to distribute dihydrocodeinone, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:968(A)(1), and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sentenced defendant to five years for the dhydrocodeinone charge and 10 years, with five years suspended, for the cocaine charge. It also ordered five years of supervised probation upon defendant's release, along with 12 special conditions of probation, including payment of fines and fees. Defendant was a first time offender, she was in poor health, and she was over 50 years of age. For possession with intent to distribute dihydrocodeinone, defendant received one-half of the maximum possible sentence and her fine was significantly less than the maximum possible fine. For possession with intent to distribute cocaine, the 10-year sentence was one-third of the maximum possible sentence, and defendant's fine was a fraction of the maximum possible fine. While the predicate sentences were reasonable, the special conditions of probation were exceptionally onerous for a disabled woman on an extremely limited income. Not only was defendant's financial situation unlikely to improve during her imprisonment or while serving probation, her medical diagnoses were chronic and would not likely improve as she aged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence for possession with intent to distribute dihydrocodeinone was affirmed. Defendant's sentence for possession with intent to distribute cocaine was affirmed and amended by deleting the special conditions of probation, with the exception of reporting to the probation office within 24-hours of release, reporting monthly, and paying a monthly supervision fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was not denied a fair trial by the admission of testimony relating to the ownership of a car because the ultimate issue was one of whether the fleeing defendant pointed a loaded handgun at a police officer. Given defendant's testimony and inconsistent statements, the prosecutor's remarks during closing argument were neither unreasonable nor unduly prejudicial. Even if a challenged statement had not been made, the verdict would have been the same because any reasonable jury could have concluded that the evidence and testimony supported the State's case. Defendant's reason for fleeing the scene with the gun had no bearing on his decision to twice point the gun at the police officer. Furthermore, defendant was not denied his right to present a defense because he told the jury he could not leave the gun in the car. Defendant's assertion that the statement was not hearsay or an exception to the hearsay rule was immaterial. The trial court imposed the maximum sentence, and a review of the record showed an adequate factual basis for the sentence because, inter alia, the State had dismissed two additional charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which convicted him of second-degree battery in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for the crime of second-degree battery. The appellate court affirmed, stating that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction and that the sentence was not excessive. Defendant argued that he struck the victim in self-defense, but it was clear that defendant's actions were neither reasonable nor necessary. Although the victim might have bumped into defendant and even flashed gang signs in his face, the response of beating the victim unconscious was unreasonable. The force was also unnecessary because defendant admitted that after the first punch, the victim was not in a position to fight back. Furthermore, the injuries sustained by the victim supported a conclusion that defendant had the specific intent to cause serious bodily injury under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:10(1). In regard to his sentence, in light of defendant's criminal history of violence to persons and the seriousness of the injuries suffered by the victim, the near maximum sentence was appropriately tailored to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted him of possession with intent to distribute heroin, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A), and sentenced him to imprisonment at hard labor for 35 years, the first five years without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The trial court denied defendant's motion to reconsider the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State produced sufficient evidence to show that defendant constructively possessed the drugs. Officers watched defendant leave and enter a hotel room several times and four packages of heroin were later found in the room in plain view. The State also provided sufficient evidence to show that defendant intended to distribute the drugs. An officer witnessed defendant distributing drugs before the arrest, the heroin was packaged for distribution purposes, paraphernalia was found with it, and the amount retrieved was inconsistent with personal use. The issue of whether the prosecution improperly commented on defendant's post-arrest silence was not properly preserved for appeal because defense counsel failed to object to the testimony. The application of the plain error doctrine was unwarranted. With regard to other crimes evidence, defendant opened the door to the testimony, the verdict was unattributable to any other crimes reference, and thus, any error was harmless. However, the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to five years without benefits because &sect; 40:966(B)(1) did not require the sentence to be without benefits. The sentence as amended was not excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and remanded the case to amend and correct the commitment to conform with the sentencing transcript. In addition, the court amended the sentence to allow the possibility of parole. The trial court was ordered to correct and amend the commitment to reflect the availability of parole accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to manslaughter under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30 in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana). He was sentenced to 20 years. The State filed a habitual offender bill of information alleging that defendant was a second felony offender. Defendant stipulated to these allegations and was sentenced to 20 years without the benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The habitual offender bill of information alleged that defendant had a prior conviction for aggravated assault. The court held, in its errors patent review, that the bill was defective because the State sought to enhance defendant's manslaughter sentence based on an aggravated battery conviction that was not obtained until after the commission of the manslaughter. The underlying offense of manslaughter was committed on March 12, 2001. He was not convicted until September 26, 2007. The habitual offender bill alleged defendant was convicted of the predicate offense on November 29, 2001. Thus, the predicate conviction occurred after the commission of the underlying offense but prior to the conviction for the underlying offense. Defendant could not be a multiple offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 based on the predicate offense alleged in the multiple bill. Therefore, he could not be adjudicated as a multiple offender. Defendant's stipulation to the multiple bill did not waive this legal defect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's stipulation to the habitual offender bill and remanded the matter to the trial court, so defendant could be re-sentenced as a first offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff heirs filed a medical malpractice action against defendant healthcare providers in the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana). The providers filed peremptory exceptions of prescription on the basis of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628. The trial court granted the exception of prescription and denied the heirs' motion to declare La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47(A)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The heirs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed an original claim for malpractice on October 13, 2006. The Patient's Compensation Fund confirmed receipt of this request by letters dated November 1 and 13, 2007. Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47(A), filing fees in the amount of $ 100 per defendant were due within 45 days from these letters, but they were not remitted timely. Although the patient died within the 45-day period, there was no provision in the law which allowed a longer period within which to pay the fees under such circumstance. The heirs' claim was then filed January 11, 2008. The malpractice occurred and was known to the heirs no later than November 8, 2006. As the original claim was invalid and without effect for the failure to timely pay fees, the original claim did not suspend the running of prescription, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.47(A)(1)(e), and the heirs' claim had clearly prescribed. The court rejected the heirs' claim that the filing fees unconstitutionally delegated a judicial function to the executive branch in violation of La. Const. art. II, &sect; 2, because the fees were not imposed to raise revenue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and one count of possession of cocaine, violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A),(C), and second offense possession of marijuana, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(C). The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms. It later granted defendant an out-of-time appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel filed a motion to withdraw and an accompanying Anders brief. On appeal, defendant challenged trial counsel's effectiveness. While trial counsel did not call any of his own witnesses at the suppression hearing, he cross-examined the State witnesses and questioned them about the confidential informants, the controlled buys, and the applications for the search warrants. Through his cross-examination, he effectively tried to discredit the State's evidence. Therefore, trial counsel offered effective assistance. Further, under the totality of the circumstances, the search warrants were issued based on probable cause. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. Defendant's claim that the search warrants were invalid because they were unconstitutionally signed by a commissioner as opposed to a judge was a meritless argument because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:716(B)(1) was previously determined to be constitutional. However, the trial court erred in imposing the sentence on one count of possession with intent to distribute because under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(B)(4)(b) only the first two years of a sentence should have been without benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended defendant's sentence on count two to reflect only the first two years of the sentence was to be served without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence, as amended, and remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to amend the minute entry to reflect the amended sentence. It granted appellate counsel's motion to withdraw.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police jury brought suit against defendant property owners in the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), seeking to nullify a public sale and to have a servitude across the property recognized. An owner filed exceptions of prescription and no cause of action. The trial court granted the exception of prescription, and the police jury appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the property was in administration due to its prior owner's death, the police jury sought to record a servitude agreement entitling it to a servitude on a gravel road across the property. The property was subsequently foreclosed on, and the property owners obtained their interest from the buyer at the foreclosure sale. The police jury received no notice of the foreclosure sale. The police jury argued that the servitude agreement conveyed to it a property interest entitling it to notice of the foreclosure proceedings, and that the failure to provide it with notice violated its due process rights as provided for in U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that the police jury was asserting that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3886.1, which provided a one-year prescriptive period for claims arising out of a failure to give notice of a sheriff's sale, was an unconstitutional limitation on due process. This claim could not be raised for failure to raise it in the trial court and comply with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:257(C) and La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1880. Because the sheriff's sale occurred in September 2006 and suit was not filed until April 2008, the action was prescribed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) entered judgment convicting defendant of aggravated rape, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42(A)(4), and indecent behavior, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81. Defendant was sentenced to death for the aggravated rape and a concurrent 7-year sentence for indecent behavior.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not err in admitting various other crimes evidence. Facts regarding defendant's previous sexually assaultive behavior were relevant to show other sexually assaultive behavior, as well as a lustful disposition toward young children. Evidence of defendant's guilty plea to second degree battery was admissible as an exception to the hearsay evidence rule under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 803(22). Likewise, a certified copy of the bill of information charging defendant with the oral sexual battery was properly introduced into evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule under art. 803(8)(a)(iii). Testimony regarding a child's initial complaint of sexually assaultive behavior was admissible under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 804(B)(5). However, the trial court had no authority to amend the sentence for the indecent behavior. In his initial appeal, defendant sought review only of the constitutionality of the death penalty for aggravated rape. Thus, the trial court's change of the sentence for indecent behavior with juveniles, making it consecutive to the sentence of the other conviction, was outside the parameters of the remand order and the jurisdiction of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and the aggravated rape sentence. It reinstated the original concurrent indecent behavior with juveniles sentence and affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Criminal District Court Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which convicted him of attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A)(1), and sentenced him to serve eight years at hard labor, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for the first two years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defense was not entitled to compel disclosure of the confidential informant because the informant was not a participant in the crime. Merely alleging that contradictory testimony was possible did not constitute exceptional circumstances or a concrete reason to disclose the informant's identity. Additionally, there was no indication that defendant's rights were prejudiced by non-disclosure. With regard to defendant's constitutional challenge to a jury instruction informing the jury that it did not have to reach a unanimous verdict, no contemporary objection was made to the instruction; thus, defendant arguably waived review of the claim. Further, there was no indication that the jury's verdict was less than unanimous. Finally, the appellate courts that have addressed the issue have rejected it. Defendant sentence had to be amended, however. Defendant was convicted of the lesser included offense of attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Accordingly, the trial court should have strictly construed La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:979(A) and given no minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Evangeline (Louisiana), which convicted and sentenced him for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967, possession of ecstasy with intent to distribute, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966, and of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When officers responded to a report of suspected drug activity between two vehicles, defendant pulled his car away, parked in a nearby driveway, and declined permission to search the car. One officer was approached by a person, who requested the officers to remove the vehicle, which was parked on his mother's property. Defendant had left the car, entered this residence, and then left the scene. An inventory search prior to the car being towed disclosed a large amount of crack, a large bag of pills, a loaded pistol, and drug paraphernalia. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. In particular, the record showed that defendant possessed the car, and thus, constructively possessed its contents. Officers testified that the amount drugs found in the car was not typical of individual use, and that the drug paraphernalia similarly indicated that the drugs were for distribution. The record also showed that defendant had prior felony drug convictions. The court found that the sentences were not unconstitutionally excessive because they were within the statutory ranges, and the trial court properly considered the applicable sentencing factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant knowingly smoked crack cocaine with a juvenile 12 years of age. Defendant argued that the maximum sentence for attempted contribution to the delinquency of a juvenile under &sect; 14:92(A)(11)(a) was two and one-half years when the crime involved the possession of cocaine and that the three year sentence was excessive because he had medical problems and was wheelchair bound. Pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1(E), his second claim was not properly before the appellate court since he did not raise it in his motion for reconsideration. The underlying offense was possession of cocaine, which, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(C)(2), carried a penalty of imprisonment with or without hard labor for not more than five years. Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:27(D)(3), the sentencing statute for attempt, imprisonment could not exceed one-half of the longest term of imprisonment prescribed for the offense so attempted. Therefore, defendant's penalty for attempted contribution to the delinquency of a juvenile by knowingly smoking crack cocaine was zero to two and one-half years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent juvenile was charged with first degree murder. The First Judicial District Juvenile Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) denied applicant State's motion to transfer the case to the district court for prosecution of the juvenile as an adult pursuant to La.  Child. Code Ann. art. 857. The State filed an application for supervisory writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile argued with his aunt's husband, the victim. The juvenile left the premises, but while the victim was calling 911, he returned, kicked in the door, entered the home, and shot the victim in the chest. At the time of the shooting, the juvenile was four days from his 15th birthday. The juvenile court erred in weighing the factors of La.  Child. Code Ann. art. 862 because the State presented sufficient evidence to prove by clear and convincing evidence that there was no substantial opportunity for the juvenile's rehabilitation. The juvenile possessed the age and mental sophistication to understand his actions and their consequences. He had been processed through the juvenile justice system many times. Thus, he had the requisite mental sophistication to understand the charges against him. He had been diagnosed with mild mental retardation, ADHD, cannabis abuse, childhood onset conduct disorder, solitary aggressive type, impulse control disorder, bipolar disorder, personality disorder, and antisocial passive-aggressive compulsive features. However, no mental deficiencies were sufficiently profound to prevent the juvenile's knowledge and understanding of the charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of molestation of a juvenile, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.2. He was adjudicated a second felony offender, and the Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Madison (Louisiana) sentenced to 30 years imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of diminution of sentence. He appealed, arguing that his 30-year sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the maximum sentence imposed was unconstitutionally excessive in that the trial court failed to consider his history and background, or the mitigating factors present in the case and that the goals of punishment and rehabilitation could be accomplished with a less harsh sentence. It did not appear that defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence with the trial court; thus, review of his sentence was limited to a constitutional review of excessiveness. The trial court took cognizance of the criteria set forth in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The court noted that defendant had an extensive criminal record dating back more than 20 years. Defendant also argues that his sentence, made pursuant to his status as a habitual offender, in effect, amounted to an unconstitutional, ex post facto application of the current stricter penalty for molestation of a juvenile. Because defendant was adjudicated a second felony offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(2)(a), the habitual offender sentencing range for molestation of a juvenile was not less than 7 1/2 years, nor more than 30 years with or without hard labor.</SPAN></P>

The retail store appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retail store sold adult magazines and movies. The law enforcement officials conducted a search and seizure of the store, seizing more than 9,000 items under a general search warrant. As a result, several individuals were charged with obscenity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106, but the retail store was not charged and was not a defendant in any related criminal proceeding. The retail store first filed suit in federal court under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988, seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction ordering the return of the seized property. The federal court dismissed the suit on abstention grounds. The appellate court held that the trial court was correct in its determination that a civil proceeding was not the proper avenue for the retail store's attempt to gain the return of seized property being utilized as evidence in a criminal proceeding. The appropriate exclusive remedy in such case was a motion under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:41 in the criminal proceeding. The retailed store was entitled to file such pleading even though it was not a party to the criminal proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment dismissing the petition and ordered the retail store to pay costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Fortieth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. John the Baptist (Louisiana), which convicted him of armed robbery with a firearm in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:64 and 14:64.3 and sentenced him to imprisonment at hard labor for 25 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his armed robbery conviction and sentence. The appellate court affirmed the conviction, amended the sentence to delete the illegal portion, and, as amended, affirmed the sentence. There was no indication that a juror had any problems listening to the evidence given his feelings about armed robbery. Thus, there was no need to rehabilitate him. The trial judge was present throughout the voir dire and could assess that juror's silent responses to the group questions. By failing to assert, when questioned, that he had a problem being a fair and impartial juror for any reason, he obviously convinced the trial judge that he was rehabilitated in the event his feelings somehow suggested bias against defendant. In regard to a second juror, by failing to assert his acquaintance or relationship with the parties mentioned, including the prosecutor, was such that he could not be fair and impartial in, and put aside, his personal acquaintance, that juror obviously convinced the trial judge that he was not biased. Given the trial judge's broad discretion in the matter, the appellate court was unable to say that it was erroneous to have denied the challenges for cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the conviction but amended the sentence to delete the order of hard labor for the five-year enhancement under La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, property owners, sued appellee parish and alleged that as a result of the parish's negligence in maintaining its drainage system, homes and property were damaged/destroyed by flooding. The parish moved for summary judgment on the ground of immunity under, inter alia, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2798.1. The Twenty-Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Charles, Louisiana granted judgment for the parish. The property owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner alleged that the parish was negligent in its operation of the drainage system, that the parish had a duty to keep the culverts clean and clear, to maintain them, and to operate the pumps in an effective and proper manner. The appellate court found that the decisions made in the instant case involved elements of judgment and choice, which meant that the parish's actions were discretionary under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2798.1. The parish had shown the necessary social and economic consideration surrounding its decisions regarding the choice and operation of the drainage system for that specific area, including the fact that its system met the necessary standards. Further, there was nothing in the record to dispute the finding that the excess runoff caused by the intense rain caused the flooding, rather than any action taken by the parish. The longstanding jurisprudential rule of law in Louisiana was litigants had to raise constitutional attacks in the trial court, not the appellate courts, and the constitutional challenge had to be specially pleaded and the grounds for the claim particularized. None of the exceptions to that rule applied in the instant case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's grant of summary judgment for the parish was affirmed. Costs of the appeal were taxed to the property owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate sued defendants over treatment he received at an outside state-operated medical facility. The district court dismissed the inmate's claims because he did not seek review of his medical malpractice claims either within the prison's administrative review process or before a state medical review panel as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39(E)(1). On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that under &sect; 40:1299.39.1(A)(1)(a) prisoners were not required to submit their medical malpractice claims to a medical review panel prior to filing suit. The court held that &sect; 40:1299.39.1 had to be read in pari materia with the provisions of &sect; 40:1299.39(E)(1), which clearly stated that prisoners' medical malpractice claims arising under the Malpractice Liability for State Services Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.39 et seq., were to be submitted to be submitted to a medical review panel in accordance with &sect; 40:1299.39.1. Because the inmate failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit in the district court, it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider his claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed insofar as it granted defendants' exception raising the objection of lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The judgment was amended to provide for dismissal of the inmate's claims without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mayor, individually and in his official capacity, sought review of the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana), which found in favor of appellees, the governor, judge, secretary of state, and registrar of voters, and dismissed the mayor's petition challenging the certification of a recall petition and the scheduling of a recall election. The mayor also filed a motion to strike.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor appealed from a judgment dismissing his petition challenging the certification of a recall petition and the scheduling of a recall election for his office; the appellate court affirmed. Election contests were to be decided quickly; likewise, the need for the finality of elections was of a very high priority. Given the strong public policy reasons underlying the short delays in election matters, the mayor failed to demonstrate that the notice or delay periods involved were violative of his due process or equal protection rights. Moreover, he failed to show any defect in the notice procedure, such as a defect in publication per La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1300.7, that would have affected his ability to timely pursue the action. It was not a case in which the mayor showed no notice to the official publication. In fact, the evidence showed that the registrar and clerk of court received the document well within the 15-day period. There was no error in the findings regarding the relevant dates of the issuance of the proclamation and the filing of the lawsuit. Thus, the finding that the action was barred by peremption was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and the mayor's motion to strike an attachment to the appellees' brief was denied. However, in deciding the case, the appellate court considered only those matters included in the record or those of which the appellate court was entitled to take judicial notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), which convicted and sentenced him for attempted second-degree cruelty to a juvenile in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his jury convictions and sentences for attempted second-degree cruelty to a juvenile and cruelty to a juvenile. The appellate court reversed and vacated the conviction and sentence for attempted second-degree cruelty to a juvenile. His conviction for cruelty to a juvenile was affirmed but that sentence was vacated due to excessiveness, and the case was remanded for resentencing. There was insufficient evidence regarding an act or acts by defendant that would have resulted in the injury to the baby's arm on February 2. Therefore, there was nothing to support a conviction for intentional or criminally negligent mistreatment or neglect of the child and there was no testimony indicating that defendant was alone with the baby when the injury to her arm occurred. Although defendant's conviction for cruelty to a juvenile was appropriate, the maximum sentence amounted to a needless and purposeless imposition of pain and suffering. The seriousness of the offense did not justify the maximum sentence since defendant was not one of the most blameworthy offenders; he was a first-time felony offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and vacated the defendant's conviction and sentence for attempted second-degree cruelty to a juvenile; affirmed his conviction for cruelty to a juvenile, but vacated that sentence; and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), which convicted him of computer-aided solicitation of a minor, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.3, and sentenced him to three years at hard labor, without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made contact with an undercover agent posing as a 15-year-old girl in an internet chat room. The appellate court found sufficient evidence to convict defendant because his conduct fell within the scope of &sect; 14.81.3. Defendant attempted to induce or entice a person whom he believed to be a 15-year-old girl into engaging in sexual conversation and masturbation. He discussed his past sexual history, the size of his penis, and the victim's experience with phone sex. These were all topics of a lewd or lascivious nature. The existence of the term &quot;presence&quot; in the statute did not limit its enforcement to only those acts committed in the actual physical presence or the immediate vicinity of the victim. It merely described the eventual hoped-for contact. The trial court did not abuse its discretion with regard to defendant's sentence, considering he intentionally communicated with a person whom he believed to be a 15-year-old girl, gained her confidence over several days, encouraged her to participate in sexual activity, and ultimately exposed himself via webcam while masturbating. Defendant's sentence was near the minimum possible sentence and he was spared a possible fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in the Twenty-fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana) to one count of aggravated rape of a child, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42. He filed an out-of-time appeal, seeking to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing that he had pled guilty in order to avoid the death penalty, a punishment that had since been found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that his life sentence was excessive. He argued that the inducement for his guilty plea had been eliminated and that it would be fundamentally unfair to allow his plea to stand. The State responded that he was never exposed to the death penalty, pointing out that the indictment listed the offense as a class II felony and that the record was devoid of any evidence that defendant was induced to plead guilty due to threats of a death sentence. Defendant did not suggest that his guilty plea was constitutionally infirmed, and an inspection of the record did not reveal such a deficiency. At the time of his guilty plea, the district court advised him of the three Boykin rights, the district court further explained that the penalty for the charged offense was life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, and defendant indicated that he had discussed the matter with his attorney and that he understood the nature of the charge against him and the possible penalty. Pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.2A(2), he was precluded from arguing that his sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, defendant was convicted of aggravated kidnapping, attempted forcible rape, first degree robbery, and aggravated flight from an officer and he was sentenced. Defendant appealed. Defense counsel filed two assignments of error pertaining to sufficiency of the evidence and excessive sentences. Defendant filed 17 pro se assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was  ample evidence supporting the convictions. The victim was forcibly seized in a parking lot and forced with the use of an apparent weapon to get in her vehicle with defendant. Defendant took the victim from one place to another as he drove her around making various stops. On the question of whether he had the intent to take something of value, the examples were abundant. Defendant's conviction for first degree robbery, attempted forcible rape, and aggravated kidnapping did not violate his constitutional double jeopardy right. The state showed that defendant abducted the victim and took her from one place to another with the intent of forcing her to give up the use of her car, money, and sex in the hope of being set free. The fact that in some cases he resorted to additional crimes to actually get those things did not give rise to a double jeopardy claim. Because defendant's statements to the police had already been ruled as admissible in the pretrial hearing, the state was entitled to refer to them as a confession in the opening statement. Defendant's sentences were neither grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offenses nor shocking to the sense of justice.</SPAN></P>
