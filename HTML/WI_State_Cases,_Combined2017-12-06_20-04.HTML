</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Rock County, Wisconsin, denied his motion to suppress evidence and convicted him for operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration in excess of 0.08, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(b) (2007-08), third offense. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the traffic stop initiated by a police officer was not supported by the community caretaker exception, and therefore the circuit court erred when it denied his motion to suppress evidence. The appellate court applied a three-part test to determine whether a seizure unsupported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion was justified under the community caretaker exception. A seizure occurred when the officer stopped defendant's vehicle. Under the circumstances, it was objectively reasonable for the officer to stop the vehicle in order to determine whether anyone needed assistance. The officer's &quot;feeling&quot; that there was a disturbance in the vehicle was not unsupported: the officer heard a yell coming from within the vehicle and his experience provided a reasonable basis to believe the yell could be a call for help. Since the officer was the only person in the area when he heard the yell, he believed that someone inside the vehicle was attempting to get his attention. He testified that people tried to get his attention only when they were in need of help. There was a substantial public interest in police assistance in such situations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Lincoln County, Wisconsin, denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence that police obtained following the stop and arrest, and defendant was convicted under Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) (2007-08) of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, fifth offense. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the investigative traffic stop was supported by probable cause that defendant had violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.13(1) because an officer observed defendant moving abruptly from the right lane completely onto the shoulder of the road, and then moving back into the right lane, while maintaining a speed of about 40 miles per hour. The court also held that defendant's subsequent arrest was supported by probable cause that he committed the offense of driving while intoxicated. The circumstances included that the officer saw defendant swerve onto the shoulder of the road and then back into his own lane while maintaining his rate of speed; defendant failed to respond to emergency lights and siren; defendant's eyes were bloodshot, he spoke in a slow and deliberate manner, and his voice was raspy; he admitted to having one or two beers earlier in the day and stated he was on pain medication; he performed field sobriety tests indicating numerous clues of intoxication; and his preliminary breath test indicated a blood alcohol content of.015. Thus, there was no constitutional violation requiring suppression of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Marathon County, Wisconsin, that found her to be an unfit parent under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(4) based on a continuing denial of visitation and that terminated her parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and daughter were living with a friend before the mother was arrested on a fugitive warrant and returned to California. The friend became the daughter's guardian until the child was removed from her care five years later and was placed in foster care. Because the mother was to remain incarcerated for another seven years and because the child had no contact with her mother since her mother's arrest, the circuit court found the mother to be unfit and terminated her parental rights. On review, the court held that the circuit court's failure to previously set forth the conditions necessary for the mother to be granted visitation as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.356(1) precluded a finding of unfitness under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(4) because the requirement that a parent be provided with conditions to satisfy for the return of his or her child was critical to the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(4).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order terminating the mother's parental rights was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions to dismiss the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which entered an order terminating their parental rights to their two youngest children under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415. The parents also appealed orders that denied their post-termination motions for visitation. Respondent, the State of Wisconsin, opposed the parents' appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In September 2004, the Bureau of Milwaukee Child Welfare removed all five children of the parents' children from their home. One of the children was then seven months old and did not have a crib. The home was dirty and in disrepair. The father had unmet drug and alcohol issues, and the mother had untreated mental health issues. In November 2004, the trial court found all five children to be in need of protection and services and entered an order setting forth conditions for their return to the parents' custody. On May 29, 2005, another child was born to the parents while her five siblings were in the custody of the Bureau. The Bureau later removed that child when the father was noncompliant with court-ordered alcohol and drug assessment monitoring and treatment and refused to provide urine samples and the mother had missed many appointments with her therapist. When placed in foster care, the youngest child had diaper rash, thrush, and her milk bottle was crusted with dirt. The court upheld the decision because the occasional supervised visits the parents had with the two youngest children were described by the supervisors as chaotic and unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>

Trial counsel stated, and defendant agreed, that when she learned that her employees were billing for services that had not been performed, she attempted to solve the problem by covering it up, by offering her employees financial incentive to falsify records. Defendant's valid guilty plea forfeited all nonjurisdictional defects and defenses. When defendant chose to plead guilty, she forfeited her right to challenge discrepancies in the evidence against her. Moreover, at sentencing, defendant personally told the trial court that when she became aware of improperly billed services, she went to the various case managers to ask them to fix their documents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which overruled his postconviction motion Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 (2007-08) and motion for reconsideration based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant had been convicted of first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree recklessly endangering safety while using a dangerous weapon, both as party to a crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the circuit court erroneously gave the jury a coercive instruction and that his attorney was ineffective because he did not object to the instructions given to the jury. The court upheld the decision because defendant's argument took the circuit court's statement out of context, and a consideration of that context defeated defendant's argument. Defendant further argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to several instances of prosecutorial misconduct during the State's closing argument. Specifically, defendant contended that the State misrepresented facts and referred to evidence not in the record. The court reviewed the State's closing argument and did not find that the prosecutor's comments rose to the level of prosecutorial misconduct. The court held that the prosecutor's argument and conclusions were fair game and that the State did not improperly vouch for the witness's credibility as alleged by the defendant. The court also held that there was not reasonable probability that a co-defendant's testimony from another trial would have resulted in a different outcome of used for the purpose of impeachment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owners sued respondents, a land use department and a board (collectively, the county), requesting declaratory judgment. The Circuit Court for Walworth County (Wisconsin) declared that the owners had the right to possess and convey their three lots individually and separately, there was no language in Walworth County, Wis., Ordinance &sect; 74-221 that enabled retroactive application, and exhaustion of remedies was not required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners purchased three lots, recorded a quitclaim deed, and the lots were then designated as three separate tax parcels. The owners were then told their request to permit three lots under one tax key number was denied. The owners sued and the trial court ruled in the owners' favor. The court affirmed. The county focused on whether the owners were entitled to judicial review. Considering the owners' request for judicial review in light of the factors set forth in case law, the trial court did not err in its finding that the adverse consequences that would result from application of the exhaustion doctrine outweighed its benefits. The question presented for declaratory judgment, whether the county erred in applying the property classification under the ordinance retroactively, was essentially the same as would have been presented on certiorari review under Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.694(10). There was no dispute as to the material underlying facts, the owners had a sound defense to the application of the ordinance, and the application of the exhaustion doctrine to their claim would be harsh. Thus, the trial court properly treated the case as an exception to the exhaustion doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which found that he was a sexually violent person under Wis. Stat. ch. 980 (2007-08).  He also appealed the circuit court's order denying his motion for post-commitment relief. Defendant had been convicted of third-degree sexual assault under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(3) (2007-08) and of resisting or obstructing an officer under Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.41(1) (2007-08).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he was entitled to dismissal of the petition against him because an amendment to Wis. Stat. ch. 980 had a retroactive effect on him that violated his right to due process. The amendment, enacted by 2005 Wis. Act 434, added third-degree sexual assault to the list of sexually violent offenses under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.01(6)(a) (2007-08), and this occurred after he had pleaded guilty to that offense. The court determined that 2005 Wis. Act 434 did not have a retroactive effect on defendant and therefore did not violate due process in determining that he was a sexually violent person. Defendant further asserted that new research on a test that was used by the State's expert to predict future offenses, contained in an article published after the trial, was newly discovered evidence under Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.15(3) (2007-08) and entitled him to an evidentiary hearing to determine if he is entitled to a new trial. The court disagreed because the information contained in the article was cumulative and even if it were admitted, there was not a reasonable probability there would have been a different result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, she was denied effective assistance of counsel because her attorney did not conduct an accident reconstruction. The court of appeals disagreed. While trial counsel did not conduct his own accident reconstruction, he did seek information from the State regarding its reconstruction. Even if defendant's trial counsel was deficient in not conducting his own accident reconstruction, defendant could not have shown prejudice. The affirmative defense under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09(2)(a) (2007-08) was only available if defendant could have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the deaths would have occurred even if she had been exercising due care and had not been under the influence of an intoxicant. Defendant could not have met this burden. Had defendant exercised due care, she would have realized that she was driving the wrong way before the head-on collision. Thus, even if her counsel had conducted his own accident reconstruction, it was doubtful that defendant would have been entitled to an instruction on &sect; 940.09(2)(a). Without such an instruction, defendant could not credibly maintain that she would have exercised her right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for sexually assaulting an individual who suffered from a mental illness or deficiency rendering him incapable of appraising his conduct, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(c).  He argued that the Circuit Court for Dunn County (Wisconsin) made errors in the admission of other acts evidence, that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction, and that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court properly exercised its discretion when it admitted evidence concerning defendant's sexual assaults of another mentally incapacitated individual. The evidence went to defendant's motive, intent, plan and modus operandi and was relevant to show defendant's method of inviting young mentally challenged men to his house to perform yard work to pay off a debt and then sexually abusing them. The crimes against the other individual were made more relevant by defendant's suggestion that he was merely performing a &quot;test&quot; on the victim, in effect denying the sexual contact was for his own sexual gratification. The danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the other acts evidence. There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction. The victim was mentally deficient and defendant, as the victim's mentor, was well-aware of the victim's inability to consent to the acts. Contrary to defendant's assertion, the statute was not void for vagueness, nor did it impermissibly shift the burden of proof by creating a presumption of the victim's incapacity to consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission applied the wrong legal standard in determining whether the employer had rebutted the employee's prima facie odd-lot case. The Commission expanded the evidentiary burden on employers seeking to rebut a claimant's prima facie odd-lot case beyond that established in prior case law by: (1) requiring the employer to produce evidence it disclosed to prospective employers a claimant's age, disability, and other facts about the claimant; and by (2) establishing a preference for evidence that the employer referred the claimant to prospective employers with specific job openings actually available. Once a claimant established a prima facie odd-lot case, it fell to the employer to prove that the claimant was probably employable and that an actual, suitable job was regularly and continuously available to the claimant. An employer was not required to disclose any descriptive information of a claimant to a prospective employer to satisfy its rebuttal burden. The employer's duty in ascertaining whether an actual job existed was to obtain information from the prospective employer about the job requirements, not provide information about the claimant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county sought to do reconstruction and maintenance on the highway, which abutted the owners' farms to the north and the south, including the full right-of-way width of 66 feet (four rods). The owners would not approve the reconstruction or the removal of fences that within the highway's right-of-way. A TRO was denied, and summary judgment was granted to the county. On appeal, the court affirmed. While the owners argued that they could rebut the presumption that the highway's right-of-way was four rods, that presumption was only triggered if the highway had not been recorded or the records had been lost or destroyed under Wis. Stat. &sect; 82.31(1) and (2) (2007-08). However, the highway at issue was recorded under Wis. Stat. &sect; 82.01(8) (2007-08) based on a resolution of a county board adopted in 1939. Because the highway was recorded, its right-of-way was four rods wide under Wis. Stat. &sect; 82.50(1) (2007-08); nothing triggered the need to resort to the statutory presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of sexual assault of a child who had not attained the age of 16 years. He pled no contest to one count. The trial court denied his third postconviction motion for relief. On appeal, the court found that he forfeited his claim that the criminal complaint was not sufficiently definite when he pled no contest. He also forfeited his claim that he was unconstitutionally denied the right to be present at the bail reduction hearing. To the extent he argued that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at the bail hearing, neither his third postconviction motion nor his appellate brief explained how he was prejudiced by counsel's alleged deficiency. Further, he did not explain why there was reason to doubt his competence. He provided no case citations to support his implied proposition that a competence determination was automatically required when an accused was on medication for anxiety. However, the trial court's plea colloquy was faulty because the trial court did not tell him that it was not bound by the plea agreement. He was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on whether his plea was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the third postconviction order denying defendant's request for an evidentiary hearing. On remand, the trial court was to conduct a hearing consistent with the dictates of Hampton. In all other respects, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Racine County (Wisconsin) of possession of a firearm by a felon and resisting or obstructing an officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the State violated his constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV when it suggested that the jury should draw an adverse inference from defendant' refusal to voluntarily submit to the DNA test before the search warrant was presented and that counsel was ineffective for failing to object. The court of appeals agreed. At trial, the State elicited testimony about defendant refusing to voluntarily submit a DNA sample on at least two occasions through different law enforcement witnesses. When the State commented on defendant's refusal during closing, suggesting his refusal demonstrated consciousness of guilt, defendant's attorney should have objected. The State had two eye witnesses, both with credibility issues stemming from past convictions, who presented contradictory testimony regarding defendant's possession of a gun. The State's use of defendant's refusal to submit a DNA sample bolstered the testimony of a witness, who said defendant had a gun. Without the DNA refusal, a witness's observation that defendant did not have a gun might have been just as persuasive as the other witness's observation that defendant did have a gun.</SPAN></P>

The participant alleged her rights were violated under U.S. Const. amend. XVI, although she never sought relief under Wis. Stat. &sect; 68.13(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The participant was involved in a federally funded Section 8 housing voucher program. On April 12, 2005, the housing authority sent the participant a letter informing her that her Section 8 voucher would be terminated effective May 31, 2005, because she failed to be home for two inspections. The participant made a timely request for a hearing to appeal the termination. She received notice the determination was upheld. The participant never sought the state provided remedy of certiorari review under Wis. Stat. &sect; 68.13(1). Two years later, the participant filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim, seeking reinstatement of her voucher and monetary relief. The trial court granted the housing authority and commissioners' motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed and held the housing authority's regulations did not allow discretion which could foreseeably result in constitutional violations. The court ruled that when a remedy of certiorari review is made available, as it was here, the requirement for procedural due process is satisfied and no actionable claim exists. Thus, the participant did not have an actionable &sect; 1983 claim for relief under the procedural due process clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of exposing a child to harmful material after viewing a pornographic video and masturbating while his three-year-old daughter watched. On review of defendant's conviction, the court held that the trial court did not err in precluding defendant from introducing testimony from an expert witness who opined that defendant did not present with traits or qualities of known sex offenders or pedophiles because the harmful exposure charge did not require proof that defendant had any sexual interest in children or that he was likely to assault or molest them for his own pleasure. The expert's testimony that defendant lacked such characteristics was not relevant to the charge because there was no fact at issue that the testimony would have made more or less probable; as such, the evidence was properly excluded under Wis. Stat. &sect; 904.03 for having a tendency to confuse the issues that were relevant to a determination of defendant's guilt. Further the trial court did not err in allowing the jury to view the video because the State was required to prove that the video was harmful to children, and the video was thus admissible to prove an element of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal. The caregiver was not a parent within the meaning of &sect; 54.15(5). The court ruled that under Barstad, a person who was not a biological or adoptive parent of a child was a third party who could not become the child's guardian over the biological or adoptive parent's objection absent compelling reasons, such as the unfitness of the biological or adoptive parent. The caregiver failed to meet the compelling reasons standard. The court noted that the parties had adopted a coparenting agreement, in which both spent equal time with the children. There were no triable factual issues concerning whether compelling reasons existed under Barstad to justify granting the caregiver's guardianship petitions over the adoptive parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was cited for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant (OWI), first offense, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) (2007-08), after a traffic stop that took place in the early morning hours. Defendant was found guilty by a municipal court and sought de novo review in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin). Although defendant pled guilty upon a stipulated agreement, he sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer testified that he observed defendant's truck gradually drift towards a median, hit a snowbank, and return to the traffic lane. The trial court viewed the squad car's video recording of the events leading up to the stop. Defendant alleged that his pretrial motion to suppress should have been granted because the traffic stop was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court disagreed. Defendant's momentary travel on the median gave rise to probable cause that an OWI violation occurred. That probable cause justified the stop. Defendant also alleged that his truck did not actually travel on the median, or that doing so for only a second, did not constitute an OWI violation. The officer testified that defendant's truck ended up traveling on the median where there was a snowbank. Having reviewed the video, the court could not say that the trial court's acceptance of the officer's testimony was clearly erroneous. The court could not conclude that the video clearly contradicted defendant's testimony. While he might have only briefly traveled on the median, that act gave the officer probable cause to initiate the stop.</SPAN></P>

None of the association's members appealed the fees under the ordinance's appeal process. However, the association served the town with a notice of claim. The town denied the claim. The association sued the town, seeking a declaration that the ordinance was invalid. The trial court dismissed the action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On appeal, the court found that the association not only could have, but should have, used the ordinance's administrative appeal process. The association's claims contested the amount of the fee and the ways in which the fee was spent. Such issues were squarely within the ordinance's appeal process. The association presented claims that the town had the authority to remedy; it could have refunded the fees in whole or part, or revised the ordinance to correct any errors. Because the association's claims could have been resolved administratively, requiring it to use the ordinance's appeal process promoted judicial efficiency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which awarded a condemnation judgment in favor of respondent, the City of Brookfield. The landowners had set forth the action pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.05 (2007-08) by contesting the City's right to condemn the proposed portions of their properties and by claiming that the City's actions constituted a total taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cases set forth by two adjacent landowners were consolidated. On appeal, the landowners did not challenge the necessity of the taking. Rather, they argued that the City should have condemned the entirety of their properties on the basis that the City's taking of a permanent limited easement across the property was an illegal and improper taking for private use and that without the easement they were landlocked. Thus, the landowners claimed that the City's actions rendered their properties uneconomic remnants and thereby resulted in a total taking. It was determined that the trial court's grant of judgment for the City was based on an erroneous finding of fact that was premised in large part on the parties' treatment of the easement at issue as private in nature. As the easement was public and because the nature of the easement was central to the issues in dispute, the decision was improper and further proceedings were necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state agency charged the funeral director and her business manager with violating Wis. Admin. Code FD &sect; 2.03(1) (2010), which prohibited anyone other than licensed funeral directors from making funeral arrangements, in allowing the business manager to gather obituary information, meet with pastors, set the time of funeral services, and discussing contract provisions with clients. They filed suit seeking damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, arguing that the application of the regulation unconstitutionally infringed upon their right of commercial speech under U.S. Const. amend I. On review, the court held that the state agency was entitled to summary judgment on the &sect; 1983 claim because the complaint failed to allege that plaintiffs' speech was actually curtailed because of the state agency's action. Because plaintiffs failed to establish an actual constitutional injury, their claim failed. In addition, the parties' appellate arguments were insufficient to permit the court to determine whether the state agency's attempts to apply the regulations were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the defendant was convicted of second-degree sexual assault of a child, the circuit court ordered him to register as a sex offender. The circuit later granted defendant's request for exemption from the registration requirements under Wis. Stat. &sect; 301.45 (2003-04) because at the time of the offense the age difference between the defendant and the victim was 4 years; the defendant was 18 and the victim was 14. On appeal, the State argued that the age difference should have been calculated by using the parties' dates of birth instead of their ages. The court of appeals agreed. The court noted that under the defendant's view, there could be almost a five-year gap between an actor and a victim. But, calculating age disparity comparing birth dates was more consistent with the purpose of registration and using the parties' dates of birth prevented the exception to registration from including actors who were more than four years older than the victim. The court held that application of the exemption from registration as a sex offender when the actor is &quot;not more than 4 years older,&quot; was properly determined by calculating the time between the birth dates of the actor and the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother, a resident of Illinois, created a trust. The mother was the trustee. The trust was funded with her assets, which included a farm in Wisconsin. All of the other assets were in Illinois. Her son and his family lived on the farm in Wisconsin. Her daughter, the successor trustee, lived in Illinois. Upon the mother's death, the daughter became the trustee. After the son died, three of his children filed an action for a declaration that the true intent of the mother was that the son's share of the trust be distributed to his living descendants. The trial court granted the daughter's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. On appeal, the court found that the trust met its burden of establishing that, notwithstanding the minimum contact of owning the Wisconsin farm property and the mother and daughter's visits after the trust was created, Wisconsin's exercise of jurisdiction over the trust did not comport with fair play and substantial justice. The burden on the trust if the action was litigated in Wisconsin would be significant and the interest of the interstate judicial system in obtaining the most efficient resolution of the controversy heavily favored Illinois.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had prior convictions for battery, disorderly conduct, and bail jumping. His current conviction for obstructing an officer stemmed from a domestic dispute. The circuit court set conditions for defendant's extended supervision, including restrictions required him to obtain the court's permission before residing with women and children. He claimed the condition was unconstitutionally overbroad, unreasonable, and imposed without authority. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin upheld the condition of his extended supervision. The condition was reasonably related to his offense, reflected the concern for women and children in the community, provided an opportunity for defendant to overcome the condition by applying for permission, and addressed defendant's need to overcome his violent behavior. The circuit court did not go beyond the parameters of the original sentencing conditions when it added this condition to defendant's extended supervision after sentencing without a hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree sexual assault of a child as a repeat offender in the circuit court for Monroe County (Wisconsin). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in applying the patient/therapist privilege to the victim's failure to report her assault during therapy, and that the error deprived him of his right to a fair trial by limiting his ability to present a defense. He argued that nondisclosure of something did not qualify as a &quot;communication&quot; within the meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 905.04 (2007-08). The court appeals found that any error was harmless. The absence of direct testimony from the victim that she did not tell her therapist about the assault did not prohibit the defendant from getting that same information before the jury. Given testimony that the victim first disclosed the assault to a friend and to a teacher a year and a half after the assault, it was an obvious inference that she had not disclosed the assault to the therapist. Defendant was not prohibited from asking the victim why she delayed reporting, or from exploring the answer that she gave when the State asked her that question. The defendant did not identify any argument he could have made based on testimony from the victim that he could not have made based upon evidence that was already before the jury.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 980 commitment, arguing that the circuit court applied an incorrect legal standard and erroneously allocated the burden of proof to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition under Wis. Stat. ch. 980 for the commitment of petitioner as a sexually violent person. Twelve years later, the State filed notice of petitioner's right to apply for discharge. Petitioner applied for supervised release rather than discharge. Following a hearing, the circuit court concluded that petitioner failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that supervised release should be granted. On review, the court held that, when the legislature revised Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.08(4) (2007-2008), it eliminated the State's burden of proof on a committed person's petition for supervised release and now authorized a circuit court to grant supervised release if petitioner demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that he met the five criteria under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.08(4)(cg). Petitioner failed to make such a showing because he had more work to do in treatment, because a more specific and well-defined post-release treatment plan was needed, and because petitioner did not establish a substantial probability that he was unlikely to engage in sexual violence if discharged on supervised release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the circuit court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which convicted him following a jury trial of, among other things, two counts of sexual assault in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(d) (2007-08) and twenty-seven counts of capturing a nude representation in violation Wis. Stat. &sect; 942.09(2)(am)1 (2007-08).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's girlfriend knew that defendant took six to nine pictures of her in the nude while she was unconscious after a night of heavy drinking. Police later discovered that he actually took twenty-seven photographs of the victim while she was nude and unconscious, including photographs depicting defendant digitally penetrating the victim's anus and vagina. Defendant argued on appeal that Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(2)(d), which prohibited sexual contact or sexual intercourse with a person who the defendant knew was unconscious, was unconstitutionally overbroad. The court disagreed. Because &sect; 940.225(2)(d) could be applied constitutionally to defendant, he could not argue that it might conceivably be unconstitutional on facts not before the court. Second, there was sufficient evidence supporting the nude representation charges. Although defendant and the victim might have slept together regularly in the nude, the victim had a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances that she would not be recorded in the nude. Further, there was ample evidence for the jury to conclude the victim did not consent to defendant photographing her.</SPAN></P>

The State failed to show whether defendant took precautions to protect his privacy in the stairwell, or whether his claim of privacy there was inconsistent with historical notions of privacy. The officers' warrantless entry into defendant's stairwell was not justified by exigent circumstances because at the time of the entry, the officers had no basis to believe the underlying offense was a jailable offense. Because the officers entered into defendant's residence prior to the determination of whether defendant's actions were subject to the penalty of jail, the warrantless entry into the residence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Section 346.072 required a motorist to slow his rate of speed while passing an emergency vehicle if there was only one lane in the motorist's direction or if there were two lanes but a lane change was unsafe. The statute did not require a motorist on a roadway with only one lane of travel in the motorist's direction to move into the lane for oncoming traffic when passing a stopped motor vehicle. Defendant was proceeding along a roadway with only one lane of travel in his direction, and therefore, he was required to slow his vehicle while passing the squad car. The officer did not provide any testimony that defendant failed to slow down or that he was traveling at an unsafe speed, or any other details that would support reasonable suspicion of a traffic violation. Therefore, the trial court properly granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Rock County (Wisconsin) of obstructing an officer, fleeing an officer, and second-degree recklessly endangering safety as a repeat offender.

The court of appeals disagreed. The circuit court acted properly when it had defendant removed from the courtroom during his trial. The record amply demonstrated that defendant engaged in disruptive and disrespectful conduct that affected the dignity, order, and decorum of the court. He refused at times to participate, to answer questions, to listen to the judge, or to obey the judge's rulings. He insisted on talking when told not to, he stormed out of the courtroom, and flatly refused to abide by the rules of procedure. He told his counsel that he intended to disrupt the trial to obtain a mistrial, and attempted to do just that. The trial court was patient with defendant, and warned him that his behavior would result in being removed from the courtroom. He was removed, but was allowed to watch and listen to the proceedings by video and to communicate with his counsel. The trial court allowed him back into the courtroom, where he remained for part of the trial until he, once again, engaged in disruptive and disrespectful behavior in an apparent attempt to obtain a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the circuit court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him upon a jury verdict of first-degree reckless injury while armed and being a felon in possession of a firearm, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 940.23(1)(a), 939.63, and 941.29(2)(a) (2007-08). He also appealed from an order denying his motion for postconviction relief without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued with his ex-girlfriend at her mother's home. Defendant shot her adult brother in the neck when he asked defendant to leave. Defendant claimed it was an accident. Defendant was distraught after the shooting, said that he did not mean to do it, and asked the mother to shoot him. During deliberations, the jury twice asked whether it could consider facts and circumstances after the shooting in deciding whether defendant showed an utter disregard for human life under &sect; 940.23(1)(a). Over defendant's objections, the trial court read language from the Jensen case to the jury. On appeal, the court ordered a new trial on first-degree reckless injury because there was a reasonable likelihood that the trial court's answer misled the jury and that it applied potentially confusing instructions in an unconstitutional manner. There was a reasonable likelihood that the jury interpreted the answer as suggesting that defendant's after-the-fact conduct was not important or compelling, that it should not be considered equally with other circumstances, or that no amount of after-the-fact regard for human life could negate early behavior suggesting disregard for human life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm because he abandoned the issue on appeal.

Appellant was stopped and based on the findings during the stop, he was charged with drunk driving. Appellant argued that the stop violated the Fourth Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, because it was not supported by reasonable suspicion that he had an open intoxicant on a public highway, Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.935, or that he was driving while intoxicated, Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63. The court concluded that the totality of the circumstances did not amount to reasonable suspicion supporting the stop. The tip was from an unknown informant calling from an unknown location and it provided no verifiable information beyond the easily obtained information of the location of appellant's car, the car's description, and license plate number. The officer's observations did not bolster the reliability of the tip that appellant had poured beer out of his car in the parking lot, as they did not corroborate any information received in the tip.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Racine County, Wisconsin, that granted visitation to respondents, his children's maternal grandparents, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 54.56 (2007-08) and ordered that the grandparents would have overnight visitation during the second weekend of each month as well as one full week during the summer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the children's mother died, her parents petitioned for visitation. On review of the circuit court order granting visitation, the court rejected the father's argument that the award was contrary to law because it was akin to a physical placement award under Wis. Stat. &sect; 767.001(5) (2007-08) as found in divorce cases and thus put the grandparents on equal footing with a divorced parent who did not have primary placement of the children. During visitation, the grandparents had the responsibility to make routine daily decisions regarding the child's care but could not make any decisions inconsistent with the major decisions made by a person having legal custody, and the same was true of a parent who did not have joint legal custody but had a right to physical placement. In both instances, routine daily decisions could be made, but nothing greater, and examples of such minor matters included what and when to eat, what clothes to wear, and when to go to bed. Therefore, the visit, whether for a few hours or an overnight, was still a visit, and the quantity of time ordered did not depend on whether it was a visitation order or a physical placement order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proceeding pro se, appellant inmate sought review of an order of the circuit court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) denying his pro se motion to modify his reconfinement sentence. The inmate previously pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree sexual assault of a fourteen-year-old girl in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(2) (2001-02). He was sentenced to three years of initial confinement and eight years of extended supervision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had a sexual relationship with a fourteen-year-old girl who was thirty-one years his junior. Pursuant to his plea agreement, the circuit court imposed a no-contract provision barring the inmate from having any contact with the victim. The inmate did not object, did not pursue a direct appeal of the sentence, and did not file a motion under Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.19(1)(a) (2007-08) for sentence modification within ninety days of sentencing. When he was released to extended supervision, he began living with the victim, married her, and never informed his extended supervision agent. The circuit court imposed reconfinement, and the inmate again did not appeal. The court upheld the order denying relief because (1) the inmate did not identify any new factors that would justify sentence modification; and (2) his motion, even construed as brought under Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 (2007-08), did not establish a violation of his constitutional right to marry. Although the inmate both waived and forfeited his right to contest the provision, continuing to deny him the right to have contact with the adult victim was constitutionally reasonable under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, convicted defendant of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI) and operating with a prohibited alcohol concentration (PAC) of.10 or more, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) and (b) (2007-08), first offense. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his detention by the arresting officer was not supported by reasonable suspicion or by the community caretaker exception and, therefore, the circuit court should have granted his motion to suppress evidence. The appellate court found that the facts as found by the circuit court met the objective standard of a bona fide community caretaker activity. It was clearly unusual for a motorcyclist to be stopped on the shoulder of a moderately busy interstate highway with no lights activated and talking on a cell phone. The trooper's manner of performing his community caretaker function was reasonable. The trooper's approach to determine if defendant needed assistance in these circumstances was reasonable. The public's substantial interest in ensuring that police assist motorists, including motorcyclists, who may be stranded on the highway outweighed the limited intrusion into defendant's privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. She reported that when she was seven years old, defendant came into her bedroom several times after she had gone to bed, rubbed her vagina underneath her clothes and penetrated her vagina with his finger. Defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree sexual assault of a child. On appeal of his conviction, he argued Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02 was unconstitutional because it did not contain a medical care exception. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin found that it would be absurd to imagine the legislature intended to include legitimate medical procedures within the bounds of the sexual assault of a child statute. Because this construction of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02 cured the statute's silence regarding medically appropriate conduct, it was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The circuit court amended the standard jury instruction to add the clarification that sexual intercourse &quot;does not include an intrusion for a proper non-sexual purpose, such as a medical examination.&quot; This instruction fully and completely conveyed the theory of the defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed summary judgment granted by the Circuit Court for Winnebago County, Wisconsin, in favor of defendant insurance companies under Wis. Stat. &sect; 802.08, arguing that the circuit court erred in concluding that none of the three homeowners' insurance policies afforded coverage for acts constituting an invasion of her privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a young woman who periodically stayed with her aunt and uncle until it was discovered that her uncle had, without her knowledge or consent, taken pictures and made videos of her in various stages of undress. She filed suit against her uncle and against the insurance companies that issued homeowners' policies of insurance. On review of summary judgment, the court held that summary judgment was properly granted in favor of two of the insurance companies because, under policy language, coverage was not afforded for intentional acts or violations of the penal law. As to the third insurance company, which joined the lawsuit by filing a motion to intervene, the court held that summary judgment was improper. The motion to intervene was not, as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 803.09(3), accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention was sought. Because no pleading was ever filed by the third insurance company, coverage under its policy was never put in issue; without a pleading from that party, the court could not examine the pleadings to determine if factual issues existed between the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment in favor of two of the insurance companies was affirmed, but summary judgment in favor of the third insurance company was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of delivery of a controlled substance, cocaine; possession of a controlled substance, tetrahydrocannabinols (marijuana); and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 961.41(1)(cm)1g, 961.41(3g)(e), 961.41(1m)(cm)1r, and 961.48 (2005-06). The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred under the Fourth Amendment by denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained in a search because the police created the exigent circumstances that led them to enter his house following a controlled buy completed by an undercover police officer. The reviewing court held that the exigent circumstances were not manufactured by the police. The police decided to conduct a knock and talk after the undercover officer exited defendant's house having purchased drugs from defendant, and on the way to the back door to conduct the knock and talk, the police saw defendant standing in the doorway. Defendant, after seeing the police, fled into the residence and shut the door. Defendant, not the police, created the exigency (the risk that evidence would be destroyed) that resulted in the warrantless search when, after seeing the police outside the residence, he retreated into the residence and shut the door after the police ordered him to stop. The court also held that it was a proper exercise of discretion when the trial court denied defendant's postconviction motion without holding a Machner hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and order.</SPAN></P>

Respondents sought frivolous appeal costs and fees under Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.25(3) (2007-08).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver struck the child on a street near a school where the posted speed limit was 15 miles per hour when children were present. The circuit court held that the driver was negligent as a matter of law because he was driving in excess of 15 miles per hour in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.57(4) (2007-08). The jury subsequently apportioned 80 percent of the causal negligence to him. The court rejected the driver's argument that &sect; 346.57(4) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of the case. Construing &sect; 346.57(4)(b) according to the common meaning of its terms, it put the driver on notice that when children were both visible and so near a school that they were in or next to a street adjacent to the school, he was required to reduce his speed to 15 miles per hour. Further, the circuit court did not erroneously exercise its discretion in denying the driver's request for a separate inquiry on the special verdict as to whether the child was outside the crosswalk when he was struck. Finally, improper remarks by respondents' counsel during closing arguments which referred to the parties' failure to settle did not warrant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that the circuit court found the conditions listed in the children in need of protection or services (CHIPS) order obtainable but determined that the mother was unwilling to satisfy them. Petitioner Marathon County Department of Social Services (Social Services) accounted for the mother's limitations and disabilities when making these efforts. The conditions of return were tailored to address Social Services' concerns regarding the mother's interaction with her children. Specific facts in the record supported each condition. The record was replete with circumstances justifying the mother's participation in the Parenting Education Program. The conditions established by the CHIPS order were designed to address the mother's self-esteem and relationship issues. Her abusive behavior toward her husband and his child by another marriage justified the requirement that she demonstrate control over aggressive behaviors and dangerous actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the circuit court for Dane County (Wisconsin) convicting her upon her plea of no contest to a charge of operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration, fourth offense, in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(b) (2007-08). She also appealed the circuit court's order denying her motion to suppress evidence gained as a result of an investigatory stop of her vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a stop of defendant's vehicle for a registration violation, the police officer became aware that there was an outstanding warrant for her arrest and that she had prior offenses for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Although defendant did not seem impaired, the officer noticed a slight odor of alcohol and she admitted drinking two beers. The officer administered a preliminary breath test (PBT) because jail regulations prohibited booking intoxicated inmates. The State later sought to use the 0.02 reading as evidence against defendant to show a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1)(a) and (b). The court overturned the conviction. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.303 restricted the admissibility of PBT results in all proceedings relating to violations of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.63(1). Although the PBT was initially administered for another reason, the State was still prohibited from using the results to prove that defendant had violated &sect; 346.63(1). Without the PBT results, the officer did not have probable cause to arrest defendant for violating &sect; 346.63(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, convicted defendant of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicant, third offense, contrary to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the traffic stop of his vehicle. He contended that the stop violated his constitutional rights because the police lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct the traffic stop. The appellate court found that the tip in the case did not add anything of value to its reasonable suspicion analysis. However, the remaining facts in the record--that the officers observed defendant drifting back and forth two to three times within his line and then cross the fog line, at bar time--provided reasonable suspicion of intoxicated driving that supported the stop. A witness' report of seeing a driver he or she believed was &quot;possibly impaired&quot; did not indicate what the witness had observed, and there was irrelevant. However, the officers observed defendant drifting back and forth in his land, and then cross the fog line, at bar time. These facts together provided a reasonable suspicion that defendant was driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, granted summary judgment in favor of respondent town by finding that appellant owners' use of the premises for adult entertainment from February 11, 2005, until the effective date of the ordinance amendment did not create a vested interest in an ongoing adult entertainment business and therefore was not a lawful nonconforming use. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued they were entitled to summary judgment because the undisputed facts showed there was actual and active use of the tavern as an adult entertainment venue on the effective date of the ordinance amendment and that was sufficient to give them a vested interest in the continuance of that use for purposes of Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.69(10)(a) (2007-08). The appellate court found that, in order for a use to be protected under the statute, at the time the new ordinance became effective, the business owner had to have a vested interest in the continuation of that use, meaning that, were the continuance of the use to be prohibited, substantial rights would be adversely affected. Because the owners did not reasonably rely on existing law when they made the expenditures and incurred the liabilities to establish an adult entertainment use of the premises, they did not acquire a vested interest by virtue of those investments and incurred liabilities, regardless of the amount. The purpose of &sect; 59.69(10)(a) was undermined if a business owner may avail himself of the protection of the statute by establishing a use after learning that it would soon be prohibited.</SPAN></P>

The judge modified the title of the complaint to read &quot;search warrant&quot; and substituted his signature for that of the officer.

Defendant argued that the search warrant did not comply with Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.12(1), and that the search was executed in violation of his constitutional rights. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin held that the omission of an explicit directive to the officers did not affect defendant's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant City of Milwaukee appealed an order from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) granting summary judgment to plaintiff taxpayer. The order declared unconstitutional&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37(4)(c) and (4)(d) and enjoined the City from relying on those subsections in connection with challenges to the assessment of real property brought under Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Wisconsin previously determined in Nankin v. Village of Shorewood that Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37(6) violated the equal-protection rights of property taxpayers in Milwaukee County under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 because it prevented them from getting a review of their assessments by filing an action under Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37(3)(d) and relegated them to a more limited review by certiorari. By enacting Wis. Stat. &sect; 74.37(4)(c) and (4)(d), the Wisconsin Legislature attempted to meet Nankin's equal-protection concerns but still give communities the ability to opt out of the action route by the adoption of an appropriate ordinance. The City adopted such an ordinance. The taxpayer brought an action on behalf of itself and other similarly situated taxpayers seeking a declaration that the opt-out provision deprived it of equal protection. The court found no violation because the statute not only gave taxpayers in jurisdictions with such ordinances the functional equivalent of a court trial, it also changed board of review procedure to give to the taxpayer a more level playing field. Thus, the treatment of taxpayers in jurisdictions with ordinances was not substantially different.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a personal injury suit in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), appellants, an insurer and its insured, brought a third-party complaint in subrogation against respondents, a physician and his practice, for alleged unnecessary surgery performed on the person who filed the personal injury suit. The trial court granted respondents' summary judgment motion, and appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer said Wis. Stat. ch. 655 (2007-08) did not abolish its subrogation claim. The appellate court disagreed because ch. 655's framework did not permit such claims and allowing them would contradict ch. 655's legislative purposes by creating new exposure for health care providers, since the physician's patient did not sue him for malpractice. The insurer's argument that it sought reimbursement of payments to the patient for damages from unnecessary surgery did not remove its claim from ch. 655 because the claim alleged medical malpractice, and a subrogation claim was subject to all limits applicable had the patient brought it. The insurer and its insured lacked standing because they were not a patient or representative, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 655.001(10) and (12) (2007-08), nor were they equitable patients or representatives, as this would contradict Wis. Stat. ch. 655's (2007-08) intent. Applying ch. 655 to bar the insurer's claim did not offend equal protection because it was germane to ch. 655's purposes to reduce malpractice claims. Public policy barred the claim because it encouraged unnecessary treatment claims and strained physician/patient relationships.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent residents sought an injunction against appellant town, which was holding a referendum. The Circuit Court for Brown County, Wisconsin, held a preliminary hearing, but declined to issue any orders before the election. The day following the passage of the referendum, the trial court issued a temporary injunction against the town. Two months later, the trial court issued a permanent injunction against the town. The town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents attempted to incorporate into a village. The department of administration's incorporation review board dismissed the petition. The legislature passed a biennial budget, creating Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.0203 (2007-08). Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.0203(11) (2007-08), as created by the budget bill, specifically provided for the town to incorporate into a village. As a result, the statute violated the constitutional prohibition in Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 31(9) (2007-08). The constitutional provision prohibited the enactment of special or private laws for incorporating a village. The town argued there was no factual basis for granting an injunction because although the residents presented evidence at the preliminary hearing, they did not present evidence at the permanent injunction hearing. First, the town did not claim it was foreclosed from presenting evidence at the permanent injunction hearing. In fact, it did present evidence of its own. Second, the town did not argue the evidence from the preliminary injunction hearing was insufficient to support a permanent injunction. Therefore, the appellate court concluded the permanent injunction was supported by an adequate factual basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged the order for guardianship entered by the Circuit Court for Oneida County, Wisconsin, appointing respondent sister, as guardian of his child who was born with Down syndrome.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was approximately twenty-three years old at the time of the guardianship hearing, but had been developmentally disabled since birth. The child functioned mentally at the level of a third grader. There was no dispute that the child required a guardian, and the only issue at the guardianship hearing was who should serve as guardian, the child's father or the child's sister. The appellate court ruled that the circuit court applied the correct legal standard and its findings were not clearly erroneous under Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.17(2) (2007-2008). The circuit court specifically found that the child's best interest would not be served by appointing the father as guardian under Wis. Stat. &sect; 54.15(5) (2007-2008). The circuit court contrasted the father's desire to cloister the child and limit her social contact and development potential, with the opportunities the sister provided. The sister utilized multiple caregivers and tutors who provided diversified experiences for the child. By all accounts, the child was thriving, well adjusted, and had made friends in her current active social environment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was then 51 years old, was charged with having sexual intercourse with a child who was not his spouse and who had attained the age of 16 years, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 948.09, 939.51(3)(a) (2007-08). After denying defendant's motion to dismiss, the Circuit Court for Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, convicted him and sentenced him to. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss on the ground that Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.09 (2007-08) was unconstitutional because it applied to unmarried persons age 16 and 17, but not to married persons of the same age, thus creating a classification that was irrational and served no legitimate state purpose. The appellate court disagreed, holding that there was a rational basis which justified the legislature's decision to treat differently unmarried and married 16 and 17 year olds. Many of the significant interests of the State were addressed when a minor obtained permission to marry, most obviously the lack of considered consent, heightened vulnerability to physical and psychological harm, the lack of mature judgment, the potential for sexual exploitation, and the potential for a minor bearing a child outside of a marital relationship. Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.09 (2007-08) reflected the legislature's judgment that absent the assurance of parental guidance and considered consent involved in the marriage of a minor, the State was justified in continuing to protect the minor until age 18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of conviction for being a felon in possession of a weapon as a habitual criminal and from an order denying his postconviction motion for relief. The appellate court affirmed. Whether a challenge to the information or verdict form would have been successful was uncertain. Moreover, challenging the information, jury instructions, or verdict form would likely have led to the State separating the single possession charge into two separate charges, which trial counsel understandably wanted to avoid. Trial counsel also explained the basis for her strategic decision to make sure that the burglary of the home of defendant's brother-in-law was not mentioned and that decision was reasonable. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction because the jury heard the brother-in-law's testimony that defendant possessed a gun in the hardware store that the brother-in-law owned and that defendant possessed a lock box that the brother-in-law said that he believed contained a gun. Further, the gun was found in a lock box that was in the trunk of the car that defendant and his wife owned and had parked in their driveway.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, that convicted him, upon his guilty pleas, of two counts of first-degree sexual assault of a child, two counts of second-degree sexual assault of an unconscious victim, two counts of sexual exploitation of a child, and one count of possession of child pornography, contrary to Wis.

Defendant's daughter gave the memory stick containing the incriminating photographs to her mother, who in turn contacted her brother, a police lieutenant. On appeal, defendant argued that he should be permitted to withdraw his guilty pleas because his counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion to suppress evidence related to the seizure of the memory stick. The court rejected defendant's argument because the police lieutenant who viewed the photos did so in responding to his sister's call about his niece, he was off-duty when he went to the home, and his actions were taken in his capacity as the girl's uncle. Further, nothing suggested that he acted to assist governmental efforts; as such, the search was a private search and was not subject to the protections afforded by the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV. Because a suppression motion related to the memory stick would have been denied, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to assert such a motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate appealed an order that denied his motion for postconviction relief, but the appellate court affirmed, stating that his trial counsel was not ineffective and that meant that postconviction counsel was not ineffective for failing to so allege. Further, postconviction counsel did not provide ineffective assistance during cross-examination of trial counsel at the Machner hearing. The inmate argued under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.01(2) (2007-08) that trial counsel should have objected to the fact that the information was filed before the preliminary hearing started, but the inmate failed to show prejudice. The complaint was sufficiently detailed as to have apprised the inmate of the charges against him and the information was consistent with the formant spelled out in Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.03. The inmate implicitly acknowledged that the parties spoke off the record. However, he asserted that the entire conference had to have taken place on the record. The appellate court disagreed under Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.13(3). While it would have been preferable for an armed robbery jury instruction to have had more specific language, the language was broad enough to encompass use of an actual firearm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that counsel performed ineffectively because counsel failed to challenge a victim's arrest-scene identification of defendant, and failed to take the steps necessary to introduce the victim's prior convictions as impeachment evidence. The court held that counsel's decision not to challenge the victim's arrest-scene identification of defendant was a reasonable exercise of professional judgment, even if the court assumed that counsel could have persuaded the court to suppress the identification.  Defendant presented a defense based on one of a previous contacts with the victim, and how it gave the victim a motive to falsely accuse defendant. A defense of misidentification would have directly conflicted with the defense actually presented, and a reasonable attorney could have chosen to avoid that conflict. Further, even it the court assumed counsel's failure to seek admission of the victim's four prior convictions was deficient, defendant failed to show that counsel's omissions prejudiced him. There was no reasonable probability of a different credibility determination, and therefore a different verdict, had the jury known of the victim's four convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a Jesuit priest, appealed from his convictions for five counts of having taken indecent liberties with two children in 1967 and 1968. His motion for postconviction relief was also denied. The appellate court affirmed however, stating that the more than 36-year delay in bringing the criminal charges against him was not inappropriate because the out-of-state tolling provision in the Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.74(1) (1966-69). Defendant was unable to establish that the delay in charging was to gain a tactical advantage since there was no dispute that the State did not learn about the crimes until 2003. The appellate court was also unable to conclude that he was denied the fundamental right to present a defense or that defendant received the ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel did not overlook a witness, but rather made a reasoned decision not to explore her testimony both because her testimony could have been impeached and it would not have helped the defense. Evidence that defendant sexually assaulted the two boys on other occasions was admissible because the evidence established, in part, that the touching was not a mistake.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant petitioner pled no contest to issuing a worthless check, he was placed on three years' probation and ordered  to pay restitution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the petitioner contended his probation terminated as a matter of law prior to revocation because the probation was extended beyond the maximum possible term of imprisonment for the crime he committed. The appellate court disagreed, holding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.09(2) (2007-08) did not prohibit the lower court from extending the petitioner's probation beyond the maximum term of imprisonment the petitioner faced for the crime he committed. The statute limited extensions of probation by requiring extensions to be &quot;for cause,&quot; and requiring courts to specify the length of the extension. The plain language of &sect; 973.09 authorized parole extensions beyond the original term of probation, not limited by statutory limits on the original term. Further, there were no constitutional violations in this construction of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested on outstanding warrants. Defendant admitted that she was hiding cocaine on her person. The trial court denied her motion to suppress. She pled guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. On appeal, the court held that the fact that defendant was walking down the street while carrying what appeared to be a beer bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag did not, alone, provide a reasonable suspicion under Wis. Stat. &sect; 968.24 (2007-08) that she had or was about to commit a crime, even if it was in an area known for public drinking. The circumstances surrounding the stop were insufficient to give rise to a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity that would justify the intrusion of an investigatory stop. Lacking a legal basis for the stop and subsequent search, the search was unlawful and the evidence seized from defendant's person should have been suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent State filed a petition to terminate appellant father's parental rights to respondent children. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, granted the State partial summary judgment on grounds that the children were born of incestuous parenthood (Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(7) (2008)). After an evidentiary hearing, it held that it was in the best interests of the children to terminate the father's parental rights. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and the children's mother were full brother and sister. A psychologist who conducted a competency exam found the father  not competent and diagnosed him as having mild mental retardation and adjustment disorder with mixed mood. The father claimed that termination based on &sect; 48.415(7), as applied to him, violated his constitutional right to substantive due process because none of the State's compelling interests in discouraging incestuous parenthood applied, since he and his sister did not grow up as biological siblings. The appellate court held that this fact did not change the risk of genetic defects and the psychological harm to children of incestuous unions caused by being raised by their biological parents. As the State had a compelling interest to prevent incestuous parenthood under the circumstances presented, and &sect; 48.415(7) was narrowly tailored to protect that interest, the statute was constitutional as applied to the father. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.426(3), the trial court properly considered the children's special needs and the father's cognitive delays at the dispositional hearing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed in part, finding first that testimony from the victim that defendant had sexually assaulted her, evidence that defendant's sperm and DNA were present in sample the victim was able to save and on the victim, and testimony of a forensic scientist in the DNA analysis unit at the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory supported the convictions. However, the appellate court could not conclude that the transcripts and report would have had no effect upon the factfinder's deliberations. In particular, defendant's report and interviews could have been used to corroborate defendant's testimony, and the victim's interview could have been used to impeach her testimony. The failure to timely produce these documents prior to trial deprived defendant of important material impeachment evidence and of corroborating evidence, both of which he was entitled to receive in order to prepare for trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on patrol, the officer noticed an occupied parked vehicle. When the officer later encountered the same vehicle pulled over to the curb in a different location, he slowed down and shined his spotlight on it. The officer stopped, exited his squad car, and approached the vehicle. Although the officer continued to shine his spotlight, he did not activate the car's red and blue lights. As the officer approached, defendant rolled his window down. The officer detected a strong odor of intoxicants, defendant indicated he had been drinking, and the officer administered field sobriety tests. An Intoxilyzer test subsequently confirmed defendant had a blood-alcohol concentration above the legal limit. The City argued that the circuit court erred by concluding defendant was seized when the officer shined a spotlight on his car. The appellate court ruled that the officer's illumination of defendant's parked vehicle with a spotlight, viewed objectively, was not a show of authority which would lead a reasonable person to believe he or she was not free to leave. Shining a spotlight on a parked car, by itself, was not a seizure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county took the child into custody immediately after she was born and placed her into foster care. Four months later, the circuit court found the child to be a child in need of protection or services. Two years later, a petition to terminate the mother's parental rights was filed. The record was overwhelming in evidence that the mother exhibited poor judgment in caring for herself as well as her child. The appellate court ruled that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(10) was not unconstitutional on its face. The statutory scheme was sufficiently narrowly tailored to the State's interest in protecting children from unfit parents. Also, Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415 was constitutional as applied to the mother. The mother's unfitness to parent the child was not due to her status as a victim. Rather, it derived from her own history of consistently failing to meet the standards required by Wisconsin law to adequately parent her children. The mother's parental rights were terminated based on her inability to parent the child, not on per se unfitness.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the board's and the members' motions for summary judgment and dismissed the landowner's complaint in its entirety. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigation had been ongoing for years. The landowner owned 225 acres in the town. He purchased an adjacent 22-acre parcel and had been attempting since 2000 to construct a farmhouse, an agricultural accessory building, and a driveway on the 22-acre parcel, but defendants had denied his applications for various permits and had condemned portions of his property for inclusion in a historic district. The landowner argued that the town did not have authority to regulate the location of buildings because such regulation was defined in Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.69(4)(g) (2007-08) as an exercise of zoning powers, which were expressly granted only to counties. The court held that the town's building ordinance was not a zoning ordinance because it did not regulate the use of land by establishing zones, and the ordinance was authorized under Wis. Stat. &sect; 61.34(1) (2007-08). The trial court did not err in refusing to admit evidence of conversations between the parties' attorneys which the landowner contended proved that the town was trying to force him to donate acres to the historic district, but which were inadmissible settlement negotiations under Wis. Stat. &sect; 904.08 (2007-08).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner developed renewable energy sources, including wind energy. In 2005, it applied for a conditional use permit (CUP) to build a seven turbine wind energy system in the town. One month after it filed its application, the county enacted a moratorium on granting permits for wind energy systems. In 2006, the county adopted a revised large wind energy system ordinance with an effective date of May 1, 2006. The owner filed a declaratory judgment action, alleging that the ordinance conflicted with Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.0401(1) (2005-06). The trial court dismissed the case, finding that the complaint was not ripe for judicial determination. On appeal, the court found that the owner's facial challenge to the ordinance was not ripe for adjudication. Section 66.0401(1) required a case-by-case approach because the information needed to evaluate the impact of the ordinance on the proposed wind system was quantitative. The owner's &quot;as applied&quot; challenge was likewise unripe because the opinions of its experts failed to take into consideration the discretion vested in the county board of adjustment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide. He was 14 years old at the time of the crime. The evidence showed that defendant and four accomplices knocked a 13-year-old boy off of his bicycle without provocation, beat him, chased him to the fifth story of a parking ramp, and threw him over the side to his death. Defendant was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The trial court denied his motion for sentence modification. On appeal, the court held that the sentence did not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The trial court considered defendant's home life along with the seriousness of the offense, his character, and the need to protect the public. It was not necessary to conclude that defendant would remain incorrigible for the rest of his life or that he was forever irredeemable to support the sentence. The brutality of the crime and the additional offenses defendant committed after his arrest defeated the argument that the sentence was disproportionate to the offense. Recent research on adolescent brain development did not constitute a new factor that would support a sentence reduction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree recklessly endangering safety while armed. The trial court denied his postconviction motion for sentence modification. On appeal, the court found that defendant's 15-year sentence, with a 10-year period of initial confinement, was not unduly harsh. Defendant had repeatedly fired a sawed-off shotgun and then a handgun into a home occupied with a family and young children, for no apparent reason except possibly as retaliation for gang involvement. The 15-year sentence was well within the 17-year, six-month maximum potential liability for the offense under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 941.30(1); 939.50(3)(f); and 939.63(1)(b) (2005-06). The sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Further, defendant's sentence and the sentence of a codefendant were not disparate. The codefendant's three-year period of initial confinement did not constitute a new factor warranting sentence modification. There was no dispute that defendant was the shooter and that he had been to the same house three separate times to shoot it up. The sentences were predicated on consideration of the sentencing factors, including each person's culpability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for La Crosse County (Wisconsin), affirming a decision of respondent Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission, which affirmed a ruling by an administrative law judge pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.30(7) (2007-08) that temporary total disability worker's compensation benefits awarded to the employee be paid directly to respondent insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker's compensation benefits were to be paid directly to the insurer in order to reimburse the insurer for disability benefits it had previously paid to the employee under a nonindustrial insurance policy. The employee argued that the reimbursement was not appropriate because he discharged his obligation to the insurer in bankruptcy. The Commission argued that the insurer had a preexisting subrogation right that survived the bankruptcy and thus, the reimbursement order was proper. On appeal, the court noted that the policy between the employee and the insurer was not made a part of the record. As a result, the court was unable to determine whether the policy created a subrogation interest. Nor could the court determine whether the policy was one of indemnity or one of investment. Absent a showing of a valid subrogation interest, the Commission had no authority to direct a payment otherwise owed to the employee to be made to the insurer under &sect; 102.30(7)(a).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed however, and agreed with the State that the father failed to establish a relationship with his child. As a result, he had no fundamental liberty interest in his child that would implicate the protections of due process and equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Further, Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(6) was not unconstitutional as applied to the father because terminating his parental rights was rationally related to the goal of the statute, which was the protection and nurturing of children in a stable home. The father's trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to make a meritless argument. The father's actions prevented him from knowing of the mother's pregnancy. His choices of committing crimes, violating rules, skipping court dates, and using drugs made him largely unavailable to see, support, parent or even visit his child. It was not his incarceration alone that prevented his relationship with the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of conviction and from an order denying his postconviction motion for plea withdrawal and a new trial. He was convicted of two felony counts of failure to pay child support and contended that the circuit court denied him his constitutionally protected right to counsel, conducted an insufficient plea colloquy, and improperly participated in the plea negotiation by changing the plea to two felonies rather than one felony and one misdemeanor. The appellate court agreed that the circuit court did not engage in the proper inquiry before concluding that defendant had waived his right to counsel; therefore, the appellate court reversed and remanded the matter for further proceedings. It was significant that defendant agreed to waive his right to counsel not in court following a proper colloquy, but rather in a meeting with the prosecutor. None of the protections afforded defendant were available. His waiver of counsel under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; and U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV was not knowingly and voluntarily made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the inmate contended the circuit court erred when it made findings after it had determined it had no jurisdiction to hear the petition, and his due process right to discovery was stifled when the State would not produce the file so that he could prepare his arguments. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the inmate misdirected his petition to the warden and, in doing so, deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction. Furthermore, no error occurred when the circuit court concluded that the inmate's litigation was frivolous, but refrained from ordering sanctions under Wis. Stat. &sect; 807.15 (2005-06).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice action, plaintiff, the father of a deceased patient, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, that dismissed his cause of action against defendant health care providers, arguing that the statute limiting medical malpractice liability, Wis. Stat. ch. 655 (2007-08), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the patient's demise, his father filed a medical malpractice claim against the health care providers whose negligence allegedly resulted in the wrongful death. The health care providers moved to dismiss; at the hearing on the motion, the trial court dismissed the claim and explained to the father that he had no standing to bring a claim on behalf of his son because he had not been appointed the personal representative of the patient's estate. On review, the court held that, while a patient or a patient's representative had a direct claim for medical malpractice against a health care provider under Wis. Stat. &sect; 655.007 (2007-08), the father was never appointed the personal representative of the patient's estate; therefore, he lacked standing to bring a direct claim on behalf of his son's estate against the health care providers. Further, the father could not bring a derivative claim for loss of his son's society and companionship because, although Wis. Stat. &sect; 655.007 allowed a derivative action to be brought by a parent for the loss of a minor child, it did not allow such a claim to be asserted by the parent of an adult child.</SPAN></P>

The mother and father lived together and were the unmarried parents of the youngest child. The mother had a second child with respondent third party, with whom she was never married. Appellants stopped allowing the grandmother to visit the children. The third party stated that he had no objection to allowing the grandparental visitation. The trial court granted the grandmother's petition for visitation. The appellate court ruled that the grandmother had standing under Wis.

Also, there was no erroneous exercise of discretion by the trial court in ordering appellants to pay any portion of the guardian ad litem (GAL) fee. The mother did not object to paying a portion of the GAL fee prior to or when the circuit court rendered its decision, and thus, failed to preserve the issue, except as to whether the third party should share responsibility for the fee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city filed a lawsuit against appellants, property owners, seeking to recover the costs associated with razing and removing the owners' building. The owners answered and counterclaimed alleging a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, dismissed the counterclaim and granted the city's motion for summary judgment on the underlying complaint. The owners' appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss the counterclaim, explaining that it was not persuaded by the owners' argument that the exclusive remedies available to it under state statutes and the municipal code were not triggered because of defective service of the raze order. At issue was whether the allegations set forth in the owners' counterclaim were sufficient to state a claim for a deprivation of the owners' constitutional rights or interests under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The appellate court ruled that the owners' counterclaim did not present a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, because the counterclaim was devoid of any allegations regarding a municipal policy or custom which resulted in constitutional infringements. The owners' counterclaim was devoid of any reference to either the issue of service of raze orders or the placarding of buildings by the city, upon which its 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim was apparently based, as evidenced by its appellate briefing. The nature and bases of the owners' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim were wholly unclear and insufficient to notify the city of the owner' position, even under Wisconsin's liberal rules of pleading.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for misconduct in public office was reversed and remanded for a new trial. Based on a newly created venue statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.19(12) (2007-08), defendant moved to transfer his case. The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, denied the motion, concluding that &sect; 971.19(12) did not apply to the charges pending against defendant. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in concluding that the newly created venue statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.19(12) (2007-08), did not apply to his case. The appellate court disagreed, finding that &quot;the investigation&quot; in &sect; 971.19(12) plainly meant a Government Accountability Board (GAB) authorized investigation. Because defendant was not the subject of a GAB investigation, category two of the statute did not apply. Defendant was charged with misconduct in public office under Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.12(3) (2007-08). While the elections and ethics chapters provided one source of defendant's overall duties as a public officer, and violation of those duties formed the basis for one element of the misconduct in public office charge, the appellate court held that misconduct in public office under &sect; 946.12(3) was not a matter that involved elections, ethics, or lobbying regulation as per Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.19(12) (2007-08). Rather, Wis. Stat. &sect; 946.12(3) (2007-08) was a criminal statute found under an entirely separate chapter. Thus, the plain language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.19(12) (2007-08) excluded this case from its coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that  (2005-06). He argued that this improper amendment violated his constitutional rights in several respects and that his conviction must be set aside as a result. The court held that the motion for post-conviction relief was procedurally barred by defendant's prior no-merit appeal, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06(4) (2005-06). The no-merit appeal had addressed defendant's motion to suppress custodial statements, the validity of the guilty plea, and the circuit court's exercise of sentencing discretion. The no-merit review conducted by appellate counsel and by the court represented a full and conscientious examination of the record. Therefore, resolution of the no-merit proceeding carried a sufficient degree of confidence warranting the application of the procedural bar. Further, defendant admitted shooting the victim and that he acted alone. Therefore, he directly committed the crime, which was one way to be a party to a crime under Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.05 (2005-06).</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that the phrase &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; in &sect; 942.09(2)(am)1 meant a reasonable expectation under the circumstances that one would not be recorded in the nude. The court further held that the stipulated facts were sufficient to establish a factual basis for defendant's plea. The parties stipulated that: (1) defendant and his girlfriend had a three-year, sexually intimate relationship; (2) on April 1, 2006, while in her bedroom, the girlfriend knowingly exposed her nude body to defendant; and (3) defendant secretly videotaped her without her consent, using a video camera that was concealed under a pile of clothing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which found him guilty of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated contrary to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for OWI and PAC, but the appellate court affirmed, stating that the officers' conduct in arriving at the scene, knocking on the window, and, when there was no response, opening the truck doors was justified by the community caretaker exception. It was December and the officers were responding to a call in the early morning hours about a person slumped over the steering wheel of a truck in a parking lot, with the headlights and brake lights turned on, more than two hours after the establishment had closed. The public's substantial interest in encouraging officers to act quickly to determine whether there was a need for medical assistance in situations such as the one presented outweighed the limited intrusion into defendant's privacy. Accordingly, the officers were lawfully acting in a community caretaker role when they opened the doors to the truck. Further, from defendant's stumbling and slurred speech, a reasonable officer could have believed that defendant had consumed sufficient alcohol to impair his ability to speak, to concentrate, and to walk steadily.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the claims. On appeal, the inmate claimed that the employee breached a contract she made with him to get him to help in the investigation of a former prison guard. The court found that the alleged contract was contrary to public policy. Because the employee did not work for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, she had no authority to affect the terms or conditions of the inmate's confinement. As to the inmate's claim that the employee denied him access to the alleged testimony of a codefendant, the court found that the claim was barred by Heck because the inmate was challenging his conviction and imprisonment. The trial court properly dismissed the claim for failure to protect because the inmate did not allege that the employee participated in the decisions about where he would be confined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town cited the property owners, a mother and son, for exceeding the permissible number of licensed vehicles stored outdoors on each of their properties. The trial court denied the owners' motion challenging the constitutionality of Manitowish Waters, Wis., Ordinance 2-06 (May 18, 2006) on equal protection and due process grounds. The trial court concluded that both owners violated the ordinance. On appeal, the court held that tying the number of permissible licensed vehicles to the number of licensed drivers was perfectly rational. The ordinance included an allowance for one additional vehicle per lot and placed no restrictions on the number of additional vehicles that could be stored indoors. The ordinance was clearly directed at the unusual case where there were excessive vehicles stored outside. The accumulation of vehicles in a residential neighborhood was an aesthetic concern and could reasonably be expected to detract from property values. The vehicle restriction was rationally tied to the number of licensed drivers residing at a property. The owners failed to prove that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court rejected his challenges and affirmed the judgment. Ultimately, there was a rational basis for the distinctions created by the legislature, the means specified in the statute, and the legislative goals of the statute. It was reasonable to exempt parents convicted of falsely imprisoning their own children from the reporting requirement of Wis. Stat. &sect; 301.45. Because not all defendants convicted of crimes lacking sexual elements posed an inherent danger to children, not all criminal defendants would have been required to register. There was no equal protection or due process violation; &sect; 301.45 was constitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued the ordinance's differential treatment of restaurants and private clubs violated equal protection. No fundamental interest or suspect class was implicated, so the rational basis standard applied. While the purpose in enacting the ordinance was to protect the public from secondhand smoke in restaurants, it was undisputed that no rationale was articulated for defining private clubs as non-profit clubs only. Whether a rational basis exists for the classification scheme depended on whether the instant court could construct one. The circuit court identified a rational basis for the classifications, and the instant court agreed with the circuit court's reasoning. The ordinance's method of distinguishing private clubs from other restaurants sought to protect the greatest number of restaurant patrons, while preserving the right to associate in truly private clubs that were not open to the public. Absent the ordinance's narrow definition of private clubs as non-profit organizations controlled by their members, ordinary for-profit restaurants seeking the public's patronage would have been able to avoid enforcement of the smoking ban by instituting a few formalities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Portage County, Wisconsin, dismissed appellant sign company's action for compensation for an outdoor advertising sign that was removed by appellee Wisconsin Department of Transportation (DOT) by concluding that the administrative procedure provided in Wis. Stat. &sect; 84.30(18) (2005-06) was the exclusive procedure and the company had not exhausted this procedure. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the circuit court erred in dismissing its petition because the procedure in Wis. Stat. &sect; 84.30(18) for challenging sign removal orders was not applicable once the sign was removed by DOT. The appellate court found that DOT's removal of the sign to facilitate the highway project did not render moot the issue whether the sign was an illegal nonconforming sign. The need for determining the lawfulness of the removal order remained critical to the question whether the owner was entitled to just compensation. Even after DOT removed the sign, &sect; 84.30(18) provided a procedure for administrative and judicial review of DOT's decision that the sign was illegal and therefore subject to removal without compensation. A sign owner had to challenge the removal order in a hearing before the Division of Hearing and Appeals followed by judicial review under Wis. Stat. ch. 227, and only if the owner prevailed on the issue of the sign's illegality could the owner seek just compensation. If the company did not prevail in its challenge to the removal order, it was not entitled to just compensation. Equitable considerations did not warrant an exception to the exhaustion doctrine.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 943.201(2)(c) (2005-06), arguing that the word &quot;harm&quot;; as it appears in the statute is unconstitutionally vague and that the State failed to prove that he intended to harm his ex-wife's reputation, property, person, or estate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's ex-wife began to receive unsolicited books and magazines and discovered that she was subscribed to an adult-themed matchmaking site through her personal e-mail account. Because the subscriptions coincided with vandalism to her yard, the ex-wife contacted the police. The police obtained copies of the subscription cards, one of which bore a forged signature, and the ex-wife identified defendant's handwriting. When questioned, defendant acknowledged his actions and indicated that he wanted to make his ex-wife miserable. Defendant was charged with identity theft for intentionally using his ex-wife's personal identifying information without her consent for the purpose of harming her reputation, property, person, or estate. On review, the court agreed with the trial court's determination that the jury permissibly gave the word &quot;harm&quot;; its ordinary meaning and that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction. Although the legislature did not define &quot;harm&quot; the term was non-technical and thus could be given its common usage. Further, the jury could infer defendant's intent to harm his ex-wife from the evidence, and there was no requirement that actual harm be shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action requesting that the trial court declare the sheriff's constitutional authority with respect to the CSU and assigning Unit members to transport federal and state prisoners without regard to a CBA. Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion and recognized the sheriff's constitutional authority to appoint CSU deputies to transport state and federal prisoners who were being housed in the county under a rental contract for prisoner bed space. On appeal, the court found that because the trial court had to determine whether the sheriff was acting in a constitutionally protected manner, it did not abuse its discretion by retaining jurisdiction over the action. However, the assignment of deputies to transport federal and state prisoners to and from the county jail pursuant to a contract for the rental of bed space was not a constitutionally protected duty of the sheriff's office and was thus, subject to the restrictions of the CBA. The money-generating actions did not hold up as certain immemorial, principal, and important duties of the sheriff at common law that were peculiar to the office of sheriff.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The request was made on the scheduled date of the trial. The trial court called defendant's concern &quot;very suspect,&quot; but did not make detailed findings about the timing of the request. Rather, the trial court focused on whether the alleged conflict was so great that it likely resulted in a total lack of communication that prevented an adequate defense and frustrated a fair presentation of the case. The trial court concluded that there was not such a total lack of communication. It noted that there had been no indication of new evidence that would require trial counsel to seek an adjournment or further time to follow up on information. At the time the trial court decided defendant's implicit motion, there were no indications that any facts needed investigating or that defendant and his counsel needed more time to prepare a defense. Thus, while trial counsel accepted fault for not returning defendant's phone calls, he indicated that he was still prepared to proceed, even if he was not optimistic about the strength of defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 941.30(1), 939.50(3)(f), 939.05 and 939.63(1) (2005-06). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury heard testimony that defendant drove his companions to a specific area looking for rival gang members to avenge the shooting of his companions' fellow gang member; that upon seeing several people on a nearby street corner, the principal, seated directly behind defendant, slid open the van door and fired seven shots from a big gun; that the area was residential; that the principal himself was shot in the face and leg; and that defendant admitted lying to the police earlier when he thought it would serve his interest. The court held that the jury reasonably concluded that shooting seven times at people on the street from a moving van in a residential neighborhood created a substantial risk of bodily harm, even if those people also engaged in similar conduct. Although the party to a crime instruction did not state that the jury needed to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the principal's guilt before it could find defendant guilty of aiding and abetting him, defendant's counsel affirmatively stated that he had no objections to the instruction, thereby waiving his objection under Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.13(3) (2005-06). There was no structural error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Circuit Court for Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, found defendant guilty of operating while intoxicated (OWI). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to admit the testimony of an expert to tell the jury that he compared defendant's blood test result with defendant's preliminary breath test (PBT) result and, by doing so, could extrapolate a probable blood alcohol concentration at the time defendant was last seen operating his vehicle, about 30 minutes before the PBT was administered. The reviewing court held that the PBT testimony was properly excluded, as required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 343.303 (2005-06). Although the expert's analysis was relevant and necessary for the defense, the State's interest in not allowing PBT evidence in OWI trials was legitimate and overrode defendant's interest in presenting the expert testimony. The testing mechanism for the PBT was simply not designed so the result obtained during the investigation of a possibly intoxicated driver was accurate enough to help a jury determine the driver's guilt or innocence. The legislature did not want the PBT admitted as evidence for that reason. If the underlying basis for an opinion was a result that could not be tested for accuracy at the time of the test, then it could not assist the trier of fact and had no probative value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's wife told defendant that she wanted a divorce, defendant beat and strangled her to death. In statements to police and the presentence investigation report writer, defendant indicated that he felt threatened by his wife and feared for his safety when he attacked her. The circuit court sentenced defendant to 35 years in prison and 10 years of extended supervision. Defendant challenged his sentence, contending that the circuit court relied upon inaccurate information when, at sentencing, it relied upon his statements about feeling threatened by his wife to conclude that he lacked remorse and failed to accept responsibility for his actions. On review, the court held that the circuit court was aware of defendant's claim, supported by a psychiatric expert, that defendant's meritless assertion of self-defense was not the result of a conscious effort to shift blame but was instead part of a personality structure over which defendant had no control. The circuit court's refusal to accept the expert's opinion regarding the motivation for defendant's conduct did not mean that it relied upon inaccurate information regarding defendant's psychological makeup.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 941.26(1)(a). In affirming, the court held that counsel was not rendered ineffective by failing to notify the Attorney General that he was challenging the constitutionality of the statute because there was no prejudice, given that the trial court addressed the merits of the argument. The court also held that &sect; 941.26(1)(a) was not rendered unconstitutional by the absence of a mens rea requirement and was not void for vagueness. Read with the definitional statute, it clearly provided that one could not possess or transport a machine gun or fully automatic firearm; one could not possess or transport a weapon that either shot, was designed to shoot, or could be readily restored to shoot more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger; one could not possess any part or combination of parts designed and intended for use in converting a weapon into a machine gun or fully-automatic weapon. Thus, defendant should have had reason to believe that he was in violation of these statutes when, as he conceded, he purchased the parts required to convert a rifle into a machine gun and attached all but one of the parts to make that happen.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court's comments did not convince the appellate court that it balanced defendant's right to be represented by his retained counsel against the circuit court's interest in the appearance of fairness and diffusing what it characterized as a potential conflict. The record contained little reference to defendant's interests, which should have been clearly addressed. The appellate court did not reach the merits of defendant's appeal from the judgment of conviction because that portion of his appeal largely relied on claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The ineffective assistance claims were to be the subject of the proceedings on remand; thus, current review would have been premature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business owner filed suit against defendant county in the Circuit Court for Burnett County (Wisconsin), challenging the constitutionality of a sign ordinance and seeking money damages. After an appellate determination that the ordinance was unconstitutional, a jury found in favor of the owner and awarded $ 200,000 in damages. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner wanted to place a sign outside his business that exceeded the size requirements in a county ordinance. The county rejected his application; there was no procedure for review or for a variance, leading to the owner's suit. The suit eventually alleged a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court rejected the county's contention that the owner was required to exhaust state remedies or follow claim procedures outlined in Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.80. Contrary to the county's position, the &sect; 1983 claim was that the county violated due process rights by subjecting the owner to an unconstitutional ordinance. Because the claim was one for a due process violation contrary to the United States Constitution, not a taking contrary to Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, a notice of claim under &sect; 893.80(1) was not required, the &sect; 893.80(3) damages cap did not apply, and &sect; 893.80(4) immunity was not a bar. In this case, lost profits were a rational, reasonable measure of damages: without a variance or other review procedure, the owner was bound by the ordinance's size restriction. It was not unreasonable to conclude that this lack of due process deprived the owner of profits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a night of drinking, defendant and others ended up at the victim's home. The victim allegedly attempted to sexually molest defendant. A fight erupted and defendant was physically assaulted by the victim and others. Defendant was able to flee to her home. At her home, defendant retrieved two knives. Defendant and her grandson returned to the victim's house. Defendant fatally stabbed the victim. She was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide. On appeal, the court found that it was within the jury's province under Wis. Stat. &sect; 971.15(3) (2005-06) to conclude that, although defendant might have suffered from a mental disease or defect, the illness was not a factor in the homicide. It was evident that the jury rejected the experts' opinions in favor of defendant's own explanation for her behavior: she was angry and drunk. Further, a jury instruction on the duty to retreat was proper as there was evidence that defendant could and did retreat to the safety of her own home before choosing to return to the victim's house. Finally, there was no evidence of systemic exclusion, or intentionally disproportionate inclusion, of Native Americans in the jury selection process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Waupaca County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant as a third offense contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 346.63(1)(a) and 346.65(2)(g)3 (2005-06). Defendant also sought review an order denying his motion to suppress arguing his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 were violated by an improper stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer saw three-quarters of defendant's vehicle go left of the center of the road right after a left turn. Defendant's vehicle then moved quickly to the right side of the road where it almost hit the curb. Moments later, the vehicle faded back toward the center of the road and almost hit a median at the center of the road near an intersection. The officer then initiated a traffic stop of the vehicle and subsequently arrested defendant for operating while intoxicated. Defendant argued that the officer had neither probable cause to pull him over for violating Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.05 nor reasonable suspicion under the totality of the circumstances to initiate a stop for some other traffic or criminal violation. The court agreed with both of defendant's assertions. Section 346.05 merely established that motorists had to travel on the right side of the road; momentarily crossing the center of the road and quickly shifting back was not a violation. In addition, the State did not show specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warranted the intrusion of the stop under the totality of the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order to suppress and the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While driving, defendant made a rude gesture to a park warden.

They tussled, and defendant ran away, picked up rocks, and positioned himself to throw them at the warden. The warden called for backup, and eventually defendant was subdued. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on Wis. Stat. &sect; 29.951 because the instruction allowed less than a unanimous jury verdict in violation of his right to a jury trial under Wis. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 5 and 7. Section 29.951 forbade obstructing or resisting a warden in the conduct of his duty; defendant argued that some jurors could find that he resisted and others that he obstructed, and he could have been convicted on less than a unanimous verdict. The court held that &sect; 29.951 defined only one crime with multiple modes of commission; the statute comported with the fundamental fairness standard embodied in the due process clause. The jury did not need to be unanimous on the mode of commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, that convicted him of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver and possession of tetrahydrocannabinols in violation of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A detective applied for a warrant related to a three-unit townhouse. The application requested an anticipatory search warrant, as the unit in which defendant resided had not yet been verified. The warrant issued but stated that authorization to search was contingent upon the ability of the police to identify the precise unit in which defendant resided. The police subsequently searched one of the units and found drugs. Defendant was charged with and convicted of drug offenses. On review, the court held that anticipatory warrants were peculiar to property in transit and were based upon an affidavit showing probable cause that, at some future time, certain evidence of a crime would be located at a specific place. The court declined to extend the use of anticipatory warrants to encompass a situation where execution was conditioned upon verification of an individual's address. Further, the warrant was invalid for lack of particularity under the Fourth Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Language in the search warrant referencing three separate residences failed to comply with the constitutional requirement that the warrant state with particularity the site to be searched.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State filed a petition to terminate respondent father's rights to his child in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(9) (2005-06), on the grounds of parenthood as a result of sexual assault. The State's motion for partial summary judgment was granted, and the trial court made a finding of unfitness in accordance with Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.424(4) (2005-06). The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the age of 15, the father had sex with the mother, then aged 13, resulting in the child's birth. These facts allowed the trial court to terminate the father's rights under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415 (2005-06). The court held that the statute was narrowly tailored to cover a specific type of parent, here a parent under the age of 16. It did not reach parents who had conceived children out of wedlock or those who conceived children with financially poor persons. The statute advanced the State's compelling interest of reducing the number of children born to and raised by persons under 16, thereby reducing the costs to Wisconsin residents of raising these children. Additionally, &sect; 48.415(9) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and its corollary in Wis. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1, because it was not facially discriminatory. Nor did a finding of unfitness based on conduct in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(2) (2005-06) constitute cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Wis. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6. A finding of unfitness simply moved the process to another stage. It did not terminate any of a parent's rights.</SPAN></P>

The attorney was aware, with his filing of the notice of retainer with the trial court if not before, that defendant's case was before the trial court. The trial court's finding that the motion to substitute as counsel that required the trial court to recuse itself, in light of the attorney's knowledge of its standing order and the recent adverse ruling on the motion to suppress, created the suspicious timing that provided for an inference of intent of an improper purpose for the substitution, was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the denial of his Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 (2005-06) postconviction motion by the Milwaukee County Circuit Court (Wisconsin), arguing that both his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective, that the charges against him were unconstitutionally multiplicitous, and that he was entitled to have his sentences run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was certainly aware of any claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him of the consequences of his plea, and he could have easily raised the issue in a response to his counsel's no-merit report. Even if the claim were raised, however, the argument would have been unsuccessful because defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered his plea. Similarly, his claim of unconstitutional multiplicity of the charges was barred because it could have been raised in his response to the no-merit report, but was not. Even so, the claim was meritless on its face because each of the car-theft charges arose out of separate incidents that occurred on different dates and involved different cars. The misdemeanor to which he pled guilty involved the theft of a purse, which occurred on the same date as one of the car thefts, but involved a different victim. Each charge required proof of facts that the others did not; the charges were different in fact and in law, and were therefore not multiplicitous. Because defendant's arguments were meritless, he could not establish either deficient performance by appellate counsel for failure to raise them, or prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state agencies and a union, sought review of an order from a trial court (Wisconsin), which awarded summary judgment to respondent newspapers in the newspapers' action to compel compliance with the open records law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 19.35 (2005-06).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspapers sought information regarding certain state employees under the open records law, Wis. Stat. &sect; 19.35. The state agencies provided the requested documents, but redacted the names of specific employees pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. The newspapers brought an action to compel compliance with the open records law. The union intervened to protect the provisions of the contract. The trial court awarded summary judgment to the newspapers. On appeal, the court determined that it was appropriate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to decide whether courts had jurisdiction to review legislative compliance with Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.92. The issue was fundamental to the relationship between the judicial branch and the other branches of government. The Supreme Court should determine whether courts had jurisdiction to review the legislature's compliance with &sect; 111.92 because it implicated Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 17 or whether, under Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8, courts were prohibited from reviewing compliance with &sect; 111.92 under the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, burglary while armed with a dangerous weapon, and armed robbery with threat of force. The inmate and two co-defendants were held jointly liable for restitution. The inmate argued the circuit court lacked the authority to direct DOC to access accounts holding gifted funds from friends and family to pay restitution. Specifically, the inmate maintained that the court erroneously relied on case law and its interpretation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 303.01(8)(b). The inmate also argued that the amended restitution order violated his double jeopardy protections, and that the order wrongfully increased his sentence in the absence of a new sentencing factor. The appellate court concluded that under Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.20 (2005-06) the circuit court properly ordered the inmate to pay restitution from funds held in his prison account, which presumably included gifted funds. The order also did not violate the inmate's double jeopardy guarantees or wrongfully increase his sentence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 943.201(2)(c) (2005-2006). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the identity theft charge on the ground that the identity theft statute was unconstitutional as applied to his conduct. The Circuit Court for Jefferson County, Wisconsin, granted the motion. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a city employee and hacked into his supervisor's work computer and sent e-mails purporting to have come from the supervisor. The content of the e-mails consisted primarily of sexual innuendoes between the supervisor and a female employee, as well as attempts to set up meetings to engage in the affair. Defendant sent the e-mails to various local and county workers, as well as to the supervisor's wife. The circuit court reasoned that because the person whose identity defendant misappropriated was a public official, application of the identity theft statute violated defendant's First Amendment right to defame a public official with true information. The appellate court ruled that the identity theft statute did not criminalize the act of defaming a public official, and therefore did not violate defendant's First Amendment rights. The identity theft statute neither prohibited defendant from disseminating information about the supervisor nor prevented the public from receiving that information. Instead, the statute prohibited defendant from purporting to be the supervisor when he sent the e-mails.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of one count of false swearing in, sentence was withheld, and he was placed on five years of probation. The Circuit Court for Racine County, Wisconsin, subsequently entered an order striking a rule of probation on the ground that it was overly broad and vague, and unconstitutionally barred defendant's constitutional rights to free speech and association, or to engage in interstate commerce. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended the trial court lacked statutory authority to decide defendant's motion to modify and strike the probation rule in question after the Division of Hearings and Appeals revoked his probation. The appellate court agreed, finding that defendant's challenge to the probation rule was moot after his probation was revoked. Further, the probation violations unrelated to the probation rule at issue were sufficient, in and of themselves, to justify the revocation. Whether defendant had shown grounds for striking the probation rule when his motion was addressed by the trial court therefore could have no effect on his revocation, and this case was moot. Further, defendant's motion did not present an issue of great public importance, or one which was likely to arise again or so frequently as to necessitate a definitive decision to guide trial courts. It also involved no challenge to the constitutionality of a statute. Thus, defendant's motion challenging the probation rule should have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel on seven different grounds and he asserted four claims of circuit court error. Defendant moved the court to admit tape recorded statements of two witnesses to the shooting, who were unavailable. The appellate court found that counsel's conclusion that the better course was to have the jury hear both statements rather than neither statement, where one was helpful, was the type of strategic choice courts did not second guess. Defense counsel was not deficient for failure to object to the officer's gesture he made while testifying that it was made by a witness on confrontation-clause grounds, and counsel was not deficient for failing to object to the gesture on hearsay grounds. The prosecutor's cross-examination of defendant was proper. The outcome would not have different had the jury not heard that defendant was incarcerated for thirty months. The nature of the right to confrontation did not require a personal waiver by means of a colloquy. The circuit court did not err in denying defendant's motion to question a witness regarding his criminal history and past incidents of aiding the prosecution with information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two incidents took place when appellant was 13 years old. The first incident occurred when appellant allegedly punched a bus patron in the mouth. The second incident occurred when appellant, his brother, and another youth battered a 74-year-old man. Among the issues presented on appeal were the following: (1) whether the appellant's statements should have been suppressed pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 938.23(1m)(a) (2001-02, eff. May 25, 2002); (2) whether the trial court violated the appellant's right to counsel pursuant to the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments; and (3) whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.19(6)(a) (2005-06) was constitutional. The appellate court concluded that &sect; 938.23(1m)(a) did not apply because appellant was not interrogated in a secure detention facility after a delinquency petition had been filed. Further, the trial court did not err in granting counsel's request to withdraw, and counsel did not provide ineffective assistance. Appellant failed to rebut the presumption that because his victim was over 62 years old, the battery had a substantial risk of great bodily harm.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed pro se from the Circuit Court for Winnebago County (Wisconsin) an order denying his motion to vacate a conviction and dismiss the underlying complaint in municipal court regarding a parking citation he received for parking in a city lot without a permit. He argued that the requirement of a parking permit was unconstitutional as it createsd an obstacle to a person's constitutional right to access and enjoy public waters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the requirement of a permit to park in the lot was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XXIV because it presented an obstacle or penalty to those trying to exercise their constitutional right to access public waters. The case defendant relied on was distinguishable because the municipality in that case did not allow parking of boat trailers on the street, whereas the municipality her did allow free street parking next to the lot. Defendant argued on appeal that it was improper for the court to rule that the ability to park elsewhere justified the requirement of a parking fee. However, defendant failed to adequately develop any legal arguments in accordance with Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.19(1)(e) and failed to cite any legal authority in his brief. He also failed to follow the procedural requirements of filing an appellate brief. For the court to have considered the arguments, the court would have needed to develop them further for him and the court could not be both judge and advocate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate entered no contest pleas in the Circuit Court for Green County (Wisconsin) to three counts of burglary as a repeat offender, in exchange for the dismissal of several other counts. Several years later, the inmate filed a Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06 motion seeking to set aside his convictions on multiple grounds. The trial court vacated one count but denied the inmate's other claims for relief and reconsideration. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate first argued that he was improperly denied counsel on his postconviction motion. However, there was no right to counsel for a postconviction motion brought under Wis. Stat. &sect; 974.06, after the right to a direct appeal had expired. The inmate also argued that he was never advised of his Miranda rights, rendering his arrest unlawful, and that the search of his apartment was unlawful due to a defective warrant. The court found that the inmate waived the right to challenge these nonjurisdictional defects, which were suppression issues, by entering his guilty pleas. The inmate argued that two of the burglary counts were unsupported by a factual basis. These contentions were not waived by the pleas, but there was adequate factual support for the counts: the record contained the allegation of the burglary, an affidavit stating that a credit card which had been reported stolen had been recovered on the inmate's person, and evidence that the inmate had blue fingers from detection powder which linked him to a related robbery right around the corner. It was not necessary for the facts to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had committed the second burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision vacating one count and denying further relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that from the moment the officer stopped her car, she was not free to leave; therefore, any evidence gathered during that time was inadmissible because she had not been advised of her Miranda rights. The court of appeals disagreed. At the time that defendant made her statement about consuming two beers, she was the subject of an investigatory stop. A reasonable person would understand that he or she was temporarily detained. Defendant was still in her own vehicle and was about to hand over her driver's license for identification when she made the statement. Only one officer was present, no gun was drawn, no frisk was performed, and the length of the detention at that point was quite brief. None of the trappings of a formal arrest were present at that time. Therefore, a reasonable person in defendant's position would not have considered herself to be in custody, given the degree of restraint under the circumstances. In addition, the officer properly prolonged the initial stop because during the initial contact with defendant, he noticed the strong smell of alcohol, glassy eyes, and slurred speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress as the officer's protective search for weapons was a violation of the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the officer testified he had personal safety concerns based on defendant's position near the stolen vehicle, his flight, his fabricated path of travel, and the crime level of the neighborhood, coupled with the officer's own experience that persons arrested for stealing a vehicle may have on them either weapons or tools which can double as weapons. The officer's concern for his personal safety, defendant's attire and actions, the time and place of the stop, and the area's crime level all factored into the totality of the circumstances. The trial court made numerous findings, including that the officer's testimony was credible, and it was for the trial court to determine witness credibility and the weight to be given to the testimony. The appellate court concluded that these findings were not clearly erroneous and, based on the totality of the circumstances, the pat-down was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed, finding that the circuit court reversed on two grounds. First, it held that the Board did not demonstrate a proper exercise of discretion because it failed to adequately explain its decision to revoke the chiropractor's license when the administrative law judge (ALJ) only recommended suspension. Second, the circuit court held that the Board denied the chiropractor due process because it did not allow him to appear before the Board (as opposed to the ALJ) regarding the proper sanction for his violations. The appellate court held that the Board's written decision made a reasoned justification of the sanction it selected, and also explained why it departed from the ALJ's recommendation, just as the Wis. Stat. &sect; 446.03 (2005-06) required. Further, the chiropractor's due process rights were satisfied in the proceeding before the ALJ; there was no statutory or constitutional right to a hearing before the Board as a whole, either in the first instance or on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued that the unidentified informant's tip that defendant had passed in a no-passing zone and was tailgating was insufficient to provide police with reasonable suspicion to stop him. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the informant, who called the police to report that he or she was observing defendant as he passed in a no-passing zone and had tailgated, provided information that could have led to his or her identification: his or her phone number. The caller stayed on the phone and dispatch was able to provide the arresting officer with updated information of the vehicles' location. The information provided by the caller was sufficient to establish the caller's basis of knowledge. The combination of tailgating and passing in a no-passing zone suggested driving that could have posed an imminent threat to public safety. Under the totality of the circumstances, the appellate court concluded that the officer was justified in relying on the information from the caller in conducting an investigative stop of defendant's vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a patrol sergeant, sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which found in favor of defendant, the Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission, and affirmed the finding that the sergeant violated a department rule in his supervisory capacity as a patrol sergeant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sergeant appealed an order concluding that a Milwaukee Police Department rule under which the sergeant was disciplined was constitutional. The Commission found that the sergeant violated the department rule in his supervisory capacity as a patrol sergeant when, as the first police supervisor on the scene of an incident, the sergeant did not take control of the situation and scene, did not begin a criminal investigation, and allowed the situation to deteriorate. His demotion to police officer was sustained by the Commission. By certiorari petition and appeal to the circuit court, the Commission's findings and conclusions were upheld in all respects. The appellate court affirmed. Milwaukee Police Dep't Rules and Procedures Manual, Rule 4 &sect; 4/070.00(2) plainly required a patrol sergeant to be familiar with all police officer duties and to &quot;assist and instruct&quot; officers under his supervision in performing those duties. As applied to the facts in this case, the sergeant's responsibility was to take control of the crime scene and instruct on-duty officers so that control could be efficiently accomplished. He did not do that.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant driver was cited for violating plaintiff city's traffic ordinance, which adopted Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.46, by failure to stop at a stop sign and reckless driving. The Circuit Court for Grant County (Wisconsin) ordered the driver to pay a forfeiture of $375 on the reckless driving citation and $160.80 on each of two citations for failure to stop at a stop sign. The driver appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police identified the driver by obtaining from a store cashier a credit card receipt for a purchase that the driver had made just before the traffic violations. The driver contended that the circuit court should have suppressed the receipt at trial because it was obtained by an unconstitutional search and seizure. However, the appellate court concluded that the driver lacked standing to raise this claim because the store, not the driver, possessed the receipt. The driver also contended that the trial court improperly considered his invocation of his right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment when reaching its decision. The appellate court disagreed, noting that: (1) nothing in the record supported the claim; and (2) regardless, it would have been within the trial court's power to draw a negative inference had it in fact done so because the case at hand was a civil case. The appellate court found no merit in several other arguments by the driver, including a contention that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove by a clear and convincing standard that he was the driver who was seen committing the violations.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in ruling that she could not impeach the arresting officer with testimony that he gave at two administrative review hearings in cases involving persons other than herself. The court concluded that even if there was error, the error was harmless. The court was satisfied that a reasonable jury would have convicted defendant on the PAC charge even if she had been permitted to impeach the arresting officer with respect to his knowledge of the field sobriety tests. The jury evidently was not persuaded by the arresting officer's testimony that defendant's ability to drive was impaired, even without the impeaching testimony. The arresting officer's testimony on the field sobriety tests was simply irrelevant to the elements of the PAC charge. Any error in not permitting defendant to impeach the arresting officer with respect to the field sobriety tests did not contribute to the PAC verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the employer and its insurer, admitted some, but not all liability on respondent employee's benefits claim. An administrative law judge (ALJ) found the employer and the insurer liable for reasonable medical expenses, including back surgery, and temporary total-disability benefits. Respondent Labor and Industry Review Commission affirmed, as did the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. The employer and its insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the employer and the insurer contended the Commission erred by awarding the employee temporary total-disability benefits and by ordering them to pay for the employee's surgeries. The appellate court disagreed, finding that under either version of the amended statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 102.18(1)(b), the employer and its insurer had to pay for the employee's treatment for his work-related injury as that treatment became necessary. Because the ALJ retained jurisdiction for such further findings and awards as might be warranted, the employer and the insurer would have the opportunity to seek a determination as to whether disc-replacement surgery was still reasonable and necessary if the employee's medical condition changed. Thus, the employer and its insurer failed to show that the statute violated their due process rights. Further, the record supported the Commission's decision, including the opinions of several doctors who recommended some additional form of surgery. As the employee was still in a healing period, he was entitled to temporary total benefits.</SPAN></P>

In this regard, the court rejected defendant's claim that the State presented inaccurate information in referring to keys that defendant's investigator apparently determined did not fit the car in question. There was no independent verification that the investigator found and tested the correct vehicle and the State's passing reference to defendant's possession of keys in closing arguments did not prevent the real controversy from being fully tried. There was no jury instruction error as claimed and the matter was not preserved for review in any event, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 805.13(3). Even assuming that the State's questions and the resulting answers were improper, certain remarks were not a direct comment on defendant's silence and the admission of the others was harmless.

While the officer searched defendant, another officer was writing out the citation that would have ended in defendant's release. Considering all of the circumstances of the situation, a reasonable person in defendant's position would not have believed he or she was &quot;in custody.&quot; Immediately after the officer told defendant that she was under arrest, she also told her that she would be issued a citation and then would be free to go. Defendant's being placed in handcuffs was associated with the fact that she was being loud and uttering profanities rather than indicating that she was being placed in police custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, dismissed appellant City of Milwaukee Post 2874 Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States' (VFW) claim that respondent Redevelopment Authority of the City of Milwaukee's condemnation of the building within which the VFW had pre-paid for a long-term lease without compensation for the lease was unconstitutional. The VFW appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The VFW argued that the unit rule was unconstitutional as applied to the particular facts and circumstances of the case. The unit rule had been used in condemnation cases to determine fair market value of the property as a single entity as if there were but one owner. The appellate court noted that strict application of the unit resulted in no compensation to the VFW. Because of the application of the unit rule, the VFW was prohibited from proving the value of its lease to the jury. The application of the unit rule under these circumstance was unconstitutional. The constitutional requirement of just compensation derived as much content from the basic equitable principles of fairness as it did from technical concepts of property law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In September 2005, the mother and father's parental rights to two children were terminated. In January 2006, the mother gave birth to a third child, the child at issue, who was born with cocaine in her system. The mother and father were not married at the time, and in fact, the mother was married to another man. The circuit court found evidence to overcome the marital presumption, and the father was adjudicated the child's parent. The circuit court later terminated parental rights to the third child because the parental rights to the older children had been terminated in September 2005. The appellate court ruled that there was nothing ambiguous about Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(10) (2005-2006), and Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(10) was narrowly tailored to advance the compelling interest in protecting children from unfit parents. The father could not be found unfit under the statute unless the child was currently in need of protection or services for the child's health, safety, or welfare, and the father had his rights involuntarily terminated to another child within the previous three years. Also, the statute was not unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 911 call was placed from a pay phone at the high school to the police. The caller said that there was a bomb in the school. The police were sent to the school. A surveillance camera revealed the caller, who was later identified as respondent. Respondent admitted making the call. The trial court ruled that Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.015 was unconstitutional, finding the statute impermissibly overbroad. Respondent argued that to be a &quot;true threat,&quot; the threat must be addressed to a person or persons and must threaten bodily harm or death. The appellate court ruled that the statute respondent was charged with violating was not unconstitutional. Respondent's telephone call was a &quot;true threat&quot; and fell outside the protections found in the First Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The police who responded to respondent's phone call believed the threat was real. Respondent apparently intended to frighten the listener, thus his call appeared to fall within the ambit of a &quot;true threat.&quot; A &quot;true threat&quot; was not limited to only threats of bodily harm or death directed to a person or group of persons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant brought an action against the city under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, challenging the city's denial of its application for a liquor license. The city moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court found that the allegations in the complaint were insufficient to state a claim for relief under &sect; 1983. Because the complaint did not allege discrimination based on membership in any particular class or group, like an ethnic or racial class, an equal protection claim was not raised. The restaurant did not allege an illegitimate animus toward its business. Moreover, the facts as alleged in the complaint failed to support a conclusion that the restaurant was intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there was no rational basis for the difference in treatment. The allegations of the complaint indicated that the restaurant was a new applicant for a liquor license from the city, while the building owners, who were granted a license, had been issued licenses in the past. The restaurant failed to set forth a claim for a due process violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three of defendant's friends, who believed &quot;something was not right&quot; between defendant and an 11-year-old girl, contacted police. Defendant described himself as a pedophile and admitted to possessing child pornography, but he denied having sexual relations with the child. On appeal, defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of the child pornography charge because the State adduced no evidence that the photographs involved were real images of real children, rather than computer-generated images. Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.12(1m)(c) (2005-06) specified that to be convicted under the statute, the person possessing the pornography had to know, or have reason to know, that the child engaged in sexually explicit conduct had not attained the age of 18 years. First, defendant failed to make his claim before the trial court. The jury by its verdict drew the inference that the pictures were photographs of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct. As to defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the appellate court did not address the prejudice prong of Strickland because the appellate court concluded that defendant's counsel was not deficient.</SPAN></P>

Because defendant withdrew his motion challenging service, the circuit court did not hear rebuttal testimony on the issue of whether defendant had been served and did not rule on the service issue. Before the court, defendant argued that Wis. Stat. ch. 980 violated due process because it did not require adequate service on the person against whom the petition was brought. The court found that defendant's position was inconsistent with the position he took during the 1996 proceedings when he decided to withdraw his challenge to service. The facts before the court were the same as the facts that existed in 1996, when defendant affirmatively requested that the circuit court not consider his motion challenging service. Thus, defendant was judicially estopped from challenging the constitutionality of the service requirements in the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioner was convicted of violation of a domestic abuse injunction, battery, criminal trespass to dwelling, and two counts of misdemeanor bail jumping, all as a repeater. Several postconviction motions were denied, and the denial were affirmed on appeal. The Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, denied the petitioner's latest postconviction motion seeking a sentence correction, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the instant postconviction motion, the petitioner argued that the sentence he received in was illegally or unconstitutionally obtained. The appellate court found that the petitioner's brief was incoherent and difficult to follow, and his arguments were conclusory and without citation to the record or analysis of the legal issues he wished for consideration. The appellate court concluded that this appeal was barred by Escalona-Naranjo because the petitioner had filed multiple postconviction motions and in at least one such motion he raised some of the issues he raised in the instant appeal. In none of his postconviction motions did the petitioner prevail. He gave no reason to revisit issues previously raised and rejected, and failed to explain why he did not raise them in his previous postconviction motions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and with operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol concentration. The Circuit Court for Marquette County (Wisconsin) granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence based on an allegedly unconstitutional stop of defendant's vehicle. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the police officer who stopped defendant possessed reasonable suspicion for the stop under the totality of the circumstances. The appellate court agreed that the officer could have reasonably suspected that defendant was driving while impaired because defendant had exited a highway, made a U-turn without signaling, stopped in the intersection in the middle of the turn, thus blocking a lane and partially blocking the intersection, was unable to complete the turn apparently because of an island with a traffic sign in the intersection, began rolling backwards, revved his engine in a loud manner, and then proceeded forward, heading in the direction from which he had just come. All this occurred at approximately 3:00 a.m., a time when intoxicated drivers were more likely to be on the road. Although there might have been innocent explanations for these driving behaviors, conduct with innocent explanations might also give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The fact that the officer might have stopped defendant primarily because of the officer's subjective belief that he was executing an illegal U-turn was not determinative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order granting the motion to suppress was reversed and the cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Walworth County (Wisconsin) denying his motion to dismiss seven of eight counts of an amended criminal complaint charging him with making visual representations depicting nudity and invasion of privacy in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;942.09 (2005-06), 942.08(2)(a) (2005-06).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with videotaping four women without their knowledge while they were either at defendant's apartment or in their own apartments. On appeal, the court held that the three counts charging defendant with violating Wis.

Therefore, the complaint failed to answer the question of what defendant was charged with because it did not recite the statute in effect before December 18, 2001. However, the court affirmed the circuit court's order refusing to dismiss the counts charging defendant with invasion of privacy because a reasonable inference from the complaint was that defendant placed a video camera in a room to surreptitiously record the victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed insofar as it denied defendant's motion to dismiss the counts charging him with making visual representations depicting nudity.

On appeal, the officer claimed that he was denied due process because he was not given pretrial access to evidence that could have aided his case. He asserted that the police chief's use of a matrix and reenactment of the incident should have been disclosed to him prior to trial. The court found that the matrix would not have provided the officer with exculpatory evidence. The reenactment was not part of the investigation, but only done to help the chief visualize the incident. The chief testified at trial and was available for cross-examination by the officer. There was evidence to support the Board's finding that the officer's story was completely unbelievable, and that he was untruthful. The Board did not proceed on an incorrect theory of law. The officer's argument that the Board was biased against him because of the speculative nature of future possible litigation was too remote to warrant recusal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a member of the Wisconsin State Legislature, was convicted of three counts of felony misconduct in public office. The complaint alleged that he hired state employees to solicit campaign funds, recruit, otherwise assist political candidates, and work on his own campaign, all on time compensated by the state and with the intent to obtain a dishonest advantage. On appeal, the court concluded that a jury instruction on misconduct in public office was erroneous. Because the instruction directed the jury that a legislator's use of state resources for campaign purposes established that the legislator obtained a dishonest advantage, it constituted a mandatory conclusive presumption. The failure to provide a limiting instruction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 903.03(3) was therefore reversible error. The trial court also erred in excluding defendant's testimony as to his understanding of the use of state resources for campaigns by other legislators; the testimony was relevant to the contested issue of defendant's intent. However, the trial court properly excluded the portions of defense witnesses' testimony as to those practices as their beliefs were not relevant to defendant's intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought an interlocutory appeal of the complaint charging her with one count of felony misconduct in public office, challenging the constitutionality of Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court's jury instruction on misconduct in public office contained mandatory conclusive presumptions on the elements of duty and intent. The appellate court agreed, finding that the error consisted of an instruction that the jury had to accept as true the elemental facts that defendant acted inconsistently with the duties of her office and intended to obtain a dishonest disadvantage if the jury found that she used state resources to promote a candidate or to raise money for political campaign purposes. This operated as mandatory conclusive presumptions in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 903.03(3) (2005-06) because the jury was not instructed that it could, but did not have to, accept the elemental facts as true. Thus, the instruction required the jury to find the intent and duty elements were met upon finding that defendant participated in campaign activities on state time. Defendant's substantial rights were affected because the instruction operated to relieve the State of its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted inconsistently with her duties and with the intent to obtain a dishonest advantage for herself or another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two boys were walking home from school when they were approached by defendant. Despite the boys' assertions that they had to be home at a certain time, defendant led them to another house. The people inside of the residence testified that the boys appeared afraid. Because they were unsure of defendant's intentions, the persons inside of the residence walked the boys home. Defendant was later convicted of two counts of interfering with child custody under Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.31(2) (2005-06). This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions. The element at issue in this case involved whether defendant caused the boys to leave their mother's care. Defendant's argument that this element was not satisfied because the boys were not with her at the time was rejected. Parental custody did not end because the children were outside of the mother's presence. Defendant's conduct clearly met the elements of the offense because he insisted that they come with him instead of walking home.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with one count of verbally communicating a harmful description or narrative account to a child. The Circuit Court for Marquette County, Wisconsin, granted defendant's motion to dismiss, concluding that defendant's Internet chat messages to the alleged victim were written descriptions outside the scope of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.11(2)(am) (2005-06). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's complaint alleged that defendant, a high school teacher, verbally communicated a harmful description or narrative account to a child by sending sexually explicit messages to one of his students in an Internet chat room. On review, the State asserted that the written messages sent by defendant were within the scope of communications prohibited by Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.11(2)(am) (2005-06). The appellate court found that the statute was facially ambiguous; but after reviewing the statute and its legislative history, the appellate court agreed with the State and held that &quot;verbally&quot; was most reasonably read here as proscribing communication to children of harmful matter in words, whether oral or written. The statute indicated that the communication could be &quot;by any means,&quot; suggesting the legislature intended to ban all communications of harmful material or narratives to children, whether in oral or written form. Defendant also failed to show that the statute did not give persons of ordinary intelligence fair notice that it prohibited written communication to children of harmful descriptions or narratives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the State's complaint was reversed, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the circuit court for Kenosha County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of the repeated sexual assault of the same child in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.025(1) (1999-2000), denied his postconviction motion for an in camera review of social service records related to the victim pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.78(2), and denied his motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter, and his conviction was based upon the victim's testimony. After his conviction, defendant learned of a pending social services investigation that someone else had sexually assaulted the victim, who with the assailant, sexually assaulted defendant's son. On appeal, the court found that an in camera inspection of the social service records was required under either the Courtney F. test or the Shiffra-Green test. The social services records were reasonably likely to contain evidence that could provide an alternative source for the victim's sexual knowledge and diminish the impact of the expert testimony regarding the behavior of child sexual assault victims. As such, Rizzo made the requisite showing that the social services records were reasonably likely to contain relevant information necessary to a determination of his guilt or innocence. Because defendant failed to timely object to the verdict and jury instructions, he waived his claim that Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.025 as applied violated his right to a unanimous verdict, and his counsel's trial strategy did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and the denial of postconviction relief. However, the court reversed the denial of the in camera review and remanded the matter to the trial court to conduct an in camera examination of the social services records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Brown County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of five counts of sexual assault and two counts involving videotaping.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed two judgments of conviction and an order denying his motion for postconviction relief, arguing that he was entitled to withdraw his pleas and that his sentence was unduly harsh and based on improper factors. The appellate court affirmed. In the plea agreement, the State agreed to keep the presentence investigation (PSI) writer from having contact with the investigating officer. However, the PSI writer did in fact discuss the case with that officer. Thus, it was ordered that a new PSI be prepared by a different writer who would have no contact with the officer. Therefore, defendant received the PSI he had bargained for, and there was no manifest injustice warranting withdrawal of defendant's plea. The State did not breach the plea agreement because defendant's attorneys' testimony was found credible as to the terms of the agreement. Both attorneys testified that the agreement did not include any term limiting consideration of the dismissed and uncharged counts. They also testified that the agreement allowed the Sate to discuss circumstantial evidence of date rape drugs. Further, defendant's attorneys' performance was not deficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, company, challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Rock County, Wisconsin, allowing respondent, property owner, to proceed with his claim for inverse condemnation against the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company maintained electrical power poles and transmission lines on the owner's property, and asserted that its use of the property for more than ten years established the prescriptive right to continue the use under Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.28 (2005-2006). The question the parties disputed was whether the construction and maintenance of the electrical poles and transmission lines, pursuant to a pole and wire agreement, constituted use of rights in real estate of another within the meaning of the statute. The appellate court ruled that &quot;use of rights&quot; encompassed the use at issue in the instant case. Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.28(2) applied to permissive uses, and did not specify that the &quot;use&quot; be non-permissive. The Wisconsin Legislature had simply concluded that, if a utility had continuously used rights in property of another for at least ten years, then prescribing a right to continue that use was consistent with sound public policy. The Legislature had apparently determined that, even if the statute deterred some property owners from granting utilities permissive use of their property, alternative options, including condemnation when available, were sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993, defendant was sentenced in state court to 14 years in prison. In January 2001, he was sentenced in federal court to concurrent terms on three counts of drug-related crimes. The federal sentence totaled 84 months and was consecutive to the state sentence. In June 2001, he was paroled on his state sentence directly to the federal government. After approximately four years and eight months of federal incarceration, he was released by federal authorities to state authorities to serve the remainder of his state-ordered parole. Three months later, he was incarcerated for violating his parole. The trial court denied his motion for discharge from sentence. On appeal, he argued that the trial court erroneously exercised its discretion by applying Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.155 rather than Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.15(5). The court disagreed. At the time defendant was serving his federal sentence, he did not have a custodial sentence to which the federal sentence could be, or could be presumed to be, concurrent. Under &sect; 973.155 and the teaching of Rohl, defendant's credit request could not be granted because it would constitute impermissible double credit against two non-concurrent sentences.</SPAN></P>

The victim's intentional misrepresentation of her age was not an affirmative defense. Evidence regarding defendant's belief about the victim's age and evidence suggesting that defendant's belief was reasonable was not relevant. Although defendant argued that his constitutional rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses was violated because the trial court did not permit him to introduce evidence of the victim's intentional misrepresentation of her age, defendant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 948.02(2) was not premised on vagueness, overbreadth, or substantive due process grounds; Furthermore, defendant argument was undeveloped.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a notice of appeal and a request for transcripts. The request for transcripts was denied because defendant's appeal rights had long since expired. Defendant filed a second notice of appeal. The appellate court deemed defendant's second appeal to be an appeal from a &sect; 974.06 order. Defendant claimed that Wis. Stat. &sect; 948.02(1) (2005-06) had not been properly enacted because the section was not prefaced by the introductory language, as required by Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 17. After reviewing 1987 Wis. Act 332, the appellate court concluded that defendant's argument was not sustainable. The appellate court also rejected defendant's claim of error that defendant's constitutional and statutory rights were violated because of no probable cause determination within 48 hours of arrest. Defendant entered a no contest plea; therefore, he waived his rights to challenge any violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 970.01(1) (2005-06). Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance counsel was rejected because defendant failed to meet his burden of proof. Defendant's claims of malicious prosecution and Brady violations also failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was born in the hallway of a crack house. When the child was born, he had cocaine in his system, as did the mother. Within a few days after the child's birth, the mother voluntarily entered drug rehabilitation and the child was placed in foster care. The child was found to be in need of protection and services (CHIPS), and the county filed a petition to terminate the mother's parental rights under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(10) (2005-2006). The mother challenged the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(10) on its face. The appellate court rejected the mother's substantive due process challenge. Each of the predicate steps under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(10) required the trial court to make findings and determinations about the parent's ability and fitness to parent based on the parent's individual circumstances. Also, as applied to the mother, Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415 did not run afoul of substantive due process safeguards. The CHIPS adjudication was a direct result of the mother's decision to use drugs and not seek proper medical care, and the mother's failure to appear was the cause of the default judgment in the termination of parental rights case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's parental rights to two children were previously terminated in 2002. The mother failed to appear at the 2002 hearing and was found in default. Despite the finding of default, the trial court held a hearing wherein the trial court made an individualized determination that the mother was unfit to be a parent. In 2004, the children at issue were removed from the home, and were found to be children in need of protection or services (CHIPS). The State moved to terminate the mother's parental rights and filed partial motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the State's motions upon a finding that the 2002 order and the CHIPS order conclusively established the mother's unfitness due to her prior termination of parental rights and subsequent CHIPS order less than three years later due to neglect. The appellate court ruled that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(10) (2005-2006) was not unconstitutional on its face or as-applied, and was narrowly tailored to meet the State's compelling interest in protecting children from unfit parents. Also, an attack on a prior default judgment was a collateral attack barred by case law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the circuit court erred when it found her unfit during the grounds phase of the termination proceedings by improperly relying on her incarceration to make its ruling.

She did not provide a safe and suitable home for her children before she went to prison. She did not resolve all of her criminal matters or cooperate with her probation agent prior to her incarceration. Once in prison, she did not comply with the rules and was cited for conduct violations, including fighting. In sum, her own testimony, together with that of her social worker, sufficiently supported the trial court's determination that grounds for termination under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(2) (2005-2006) existed and the court's finding of unfitness was proper.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence that the police discovered after a warrantless entry into a room that he was renting. The court found that the owner of the residence where the room was located provided valid consent for the search of the room such that there was no violation of defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Defendant was present in the kitchen and overheard the entire exchange that took place between the officers and the owner of the residence, during which the owner told the officers that defendant rented a room, without identifying which room, and consented to a search of the entire premises without limitation. There was no way for the officers to distinguish defendant's room from the rest of the house for which they had consent to search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant petroleum corporation sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Marinette County (Wisconsin), which awarded summary judgment, damages, costs, and attorney fees to plaintiff gas station operator in an action for violation of the Wisconsin Unfair Sales Act, Wis. Stat. &sect; 100.30 (1999-2000). The operator challenged the amount of costs and attorney fees that it was awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator brought an action against the corporation for violation of the Act. The trial court awarded summary judgment to the operator and held that the corporation violated the Act on 238 days. The trial court awarded the operator statutory damages, plus costs and attorney fees. On appeal, the court concluded that the trial court erred when it ruled that a lack of documentary evidence under Wis. Stat. &sect; 100.30(6)(a)7 was fatal to the corporation's summary judgment defense. The failure of the corporation to retain records to verify a lower competitor's price or to verify filing a notice with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection did not dispositively mean that it was not meeting competition. It only meant that the corporation had the burden of establishing that it actually was meeting competition in good faith. Nothing about the plain language of &sect; 100.30(6)(a)7 required that advertisements or records be produced at trial. Nothing in &sect; 100.30 precluded the corporation from offering testimony about the documents it relied on when making the pricing changes. A factual issue was raised as to whether the asserted documents ever existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court also reversed the award of costs and attorney fees to the operator; on remand, the trial court was to vacate the order.</SPAN></P>

Postconviction, defendant moved to withdraw from the plea agreement. The circuit court for Washington County (Wisconsin) limited the remedy to withdrawal of the plea to the reckless endangerment charge. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to armed robbery and reckless endangerment charges, but the trial court misinformed him of the reckless endangerment elements. The trial court imposed a 25-year sentence on the armed robbery count and a concurrent sentence of 15 years on the reckless endangerment count. The trial court granted defendant's motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 809.30 as to the reckless endangerment charge based on the misinformation, but refused to vacate the entire agreement, leaving intact defendant's plea and sentence on the armed robbery charge. The appellate court determined that the erroneous exercise of discretion standard applied to the trial court's choice of remedy when faced with the motion to withdraw all or part of a plea agreement. The appellate court found that the trial court properly exercised its discretion when it denied defendant's request to withdraw from the entire plea because, inter alia, (1) withdrawing the defective plea left defendant with one less conviction and in the same position sentence-wise, and (2) the misinformation as to the reckless endangerment charge was not material or substantial as to the armed robbery charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling and the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to armed robbery, threat of force, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. After learning of a letter by the Governor directing the department of corrections to block the release of certain violent offenders, defendant filed a motion to modify his sentence. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, construed the motion as a motion for resentencing and imposed the original sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant challenged the trial court's conclusion that a new factor in support of sentence modification had not been established and its conversion of his motion for sentence modification to a motion to vacate sentence. The appellate court found that the trial court properly concluded that the Governor's letter was not a &quot;new factor.&quot; However, at that juncture, the motion for sentence modification should have been denied because, as the trial court implicitly found, defendant had not carried his burden to prove a new factor by clear and convincing evidence. Furthermore, defendant, who was acting pro se, repeatedly told the trial court that he had asked for, and wanted, a sentence modification and not a resentencing. The appellate court stated that the trial court should not have converted a motion for sentence modification to a motion for resentencing in the absence of a clear, unequivocal and knowing stipulation by defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded with instructions to vacate the sentence in effect, to deny the motion to modify the sentence, and to reinstate the sentence originally imposed with credit for all time served from the date the original sentence was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time the child was conceived, the father was 21 years old and the mother was 15 years old. The father was later charged with having sexually assaulted the mother at the time of conception. The complaint alleged that the parents engaged in consensual sexual intercourse. The felony charge of sexual assault of a child was later amended and the father was ultimately convicted of two counts of fourth-degree sexual assault under Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.225(3m), a Class A misdemeanor. The mother filed a petition for the involuntary termination of parental rights (TPR) against the father under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(9)(a). The trial court terminated the father's rights. On appeal, the court found that because the father was never convicted of any of the crimes specified in Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.42(2m)(a), the mother was not entitled to deprive him of notice of the TPR petition and the trial court erred when it denied him standing to contest the termination of his rights. The trial court's ruling that the father's parental rights had to be terminated under Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(9), regardless of the fact that he was never convicted of one of the specified offenses, misapplied the statute.</SPAN></P>

Following appellant's request for judicial substitution, the trial court conducted a probable cause hearing on January 3, 2003. Eighty-seven days after the probable cause hearing, appellant moved to dismiss for failure to commence the commitment trial within forty-five days of the probable cause determination. The trial court denied dismissal on the basis of equitable estoppel. The appellate court ruled that it was not persuaded that appellant's election not to challenge the timeliness of the petition equitably estopped him from seeking dismissal on the basis of the forty-five-day rule of Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.05(1) (2001-2002). The record established that the trial court could have found that good cause existed to extend the statutory deadline of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which found him to be a sexually violent person and committed him to institutional care pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.01(7) (2003-04). On appeal, appellant challenged the timeliness of the petition seeking his committal, the sufficiency of evidence to support the circuit court's factual findings, and the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. ch. 980.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A habeas court ordered that appellant be released by May 22, 2002. Thus, the petition, filed on May 1, 2002, correctly alleged that appellant was within 90 days of release. The recalculation of appellant's mandatory release date did not render the petition untimely. As to appellant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the fact that appellant had not committed a sexually violent offense since his conviction in 1976 did not preclude a finding of dangerousness within the meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.02(2)(c) (2001-02). Further, the circuit court's conclusion that appellant was a sexually violent person was supported by evidence in the record, including appellant's high scores on an instrument designed to measure current psychopathology, his lack of remorse for his victims, his teeming anger, and his manipulation of the truth and the rules in order to avoid sex offender treatment and to carry on an illicit sexual relationship in a state mental health facility. Finally, appellant's constitutional challenge had already been rejected by the court in a prior case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a corporation and condominium association, appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Rock County (Wisconsin) upholding a decision of defendant town board to rezone a parcel of land owned by intervenor property owners, which was adjacent to the condominium complex.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applying the presumption that the zoning ordinance was valid, and giving controlling deference to the town board's zoning authority, the court concluded that the town board properly exercised its discretion in granting the petition to rezone the property. The record contained substantial evidence that rezoning the property would have benefited the public by providing a place where the public could fish, hunt, hike, train dogs, and sight their rifles. The court rejected plaintiffs' contention that the town board's sole purpose for granting the property owners' rezoning petition was to &quot;legalize&quot; the property owners' sport shooting business. The town board had previously determined that the property owners' use of their property was lawful, and the record was devoid of any evidence that the town board's sole purpose for rezoning the property was to legalize a nonconforming use. Finally, the court concluded that the town board did not engage in spot zoning. The size of the property was nearly 200 acres, which was much larger than other properties generally found to be subjects of spot zoning.</SPAN></P>

The caller also gave the dispatcher his name. The officer proceeded to the location and observed a vehicle matching the description relayed to him by dispatch. The officer observed the vehicle cross the fog line and move onto the gravel portion of the road. Based on his observations and the information he had received from dispatch, the officer performed a traffic stop of the vehicle. As a result of the evidence obtained during the stop, defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated. The appellate court ruled that the officer had reasonable suspicion to perform the traffic stop of defendant's vehicle. Based on the reliability of the tip and the other facts in the record, the totality of the circumstances provided the officer with reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop of defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants owned and operated a construction contracting company. They were charged with felony theft by contractor, party to a crime. A preliminary hearing was held, after which the trial court bound defendants over for trial. The trial court denied defendants' motion to dismiss the bindover and the information. On appeal, the court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 779.02(5) prohibited a prime contractor who also acted as a subcontractor from taking a profit on items supplied as a subcontractor before all other subcontractors were paid for labor and materials in full, or proportionately in cases of a deficiency. Defendants could be held criminally liable because the undisputed evidence indicated that they intentionally used money from entrusted funds to pay themselves a profit. The trial court had sufficient evidence to deny defendants' motion to dismiss their bindover and information. Defendants admitted that the unaccounted amount of $ 36,038 was money that one defendant took as a profit. It could reasonably be inferred that clients did not consent to defendants paying themselves a profit before paying the subcontractors for labor and materials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to correct an erroneous sentence because it was illegal as it unconstitutionally increased his originally-imposed term of probation to ten years in prison. The court of appeals declined to address the merits of defendant's claim because it was procedurally barred. Defendant failed to raise the sentencing issues in his direct appeal. Moreover, he failed to raise the sentencing issue in his pro se motion for postconviction relief. Defendant could have and should have raised the issue either during his direct appeal or during his first postconviction motion/appeal. Because he failed to do so in either his first or second appeal, his sentencing claims were procedurally barred. Moreover, defendant failed to provide the court of appeals with a sufficient reason to overcome the procedural bar. Defendant did briefly allege that his postconviction counsel's ineffective assistance should constitute a sufficient reason for failing to raise the issue. However, defendant failed to adequately brief such argument, and failed to reply to the State's response that his argument was insufficient to overcome the procedural bar.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for homicide by intoxicated use of a motor vehicle; his postconviction motion challenging the sentence was denied, and the denial was twice affirmed on appeal. Years later, defendant filed a motion seeking to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, summarily denied the motion, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that his guilty plea was unconstitutional because he was not properly advised that one of the charges would be dismissed. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the record showed that defendant knew one of the charges would be dismissed upon conviction, and that he could not be convicted of both charges. This was clearly stated before defendant entered his plea. Moreover, defense counsel noted on the record that she had explained to defendant that the statute allowed different ways of proving the offense. Further, the complaint was not required to contain evidence regarding prior convictions because the two statutes with which defendant was charged, Wis. Stat. &sect; 940.09(1)(a), (b) (1999-2000), did not require proof of other convictions, suspensions or revocations. Accordingly, there was no basis for trial counsel to seek dismissal of the complaint. The sentencing transcript demonstrated that trial counsel argued for leniency and emphasized defendant's extreme remorse, which carried more persuasiveness than the notation defendant relied on on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The driver moved to dismiss the criminal complaint on the ground that the complaint failed to state facts concerning every element of the offense. The Circuit Court for Marquette County, Wisconsin, agreed with the driver and refused to bind her over for trial. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State argued that while the trial court's reading of Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.67(1) (2005-06) might have been reasonable, it was more reasonable to read the statute to require that the motor vehicle operator identify himself or herself as the operator. The driver responded that the statute plainly did not impose this requirement. The appellate court concluded that &sect; 346.67(1) required an operator of a vehicle to identify him or herself as the operator of the vehicle. With this construction of the statute, there was no dispute that the evidence at the preliminary hearing was sufficient to support a bind over of the driver on this charge as the driver inaccurately told the officer she was the passenger and left the scene without correcting that inaccurate information. Thus, the driver did comply with the statute, and the trial court erred in refusing to bind over the driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded to the trial court with instructions to order that the driver be bound over on the charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Lincoln County (Wisconsin), which awarded judgment to defendants in an adverse possession action. Defendants challenged an order denying their claim for expenses under Wis. Stat. &sect; 804.12(3) (2005-06) for successfully proving issues that were the subject of denials of requests for admissions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action to obtain a declaration that a portion of defendants' property had been gained by adverse possession. Defendants asserted that they owned the entirety of the property, which was obtained from a county in 1995. The county had obtained title to the parcel by tax deed on March 20, 1986. The trial court concluded that a tax deed was not derivative, but created a new title that extinguished all former titles and liens not expressly exempted by statute from its operation. The trial court rejected plaintiffs' argument that Wis. Stat. &sect; 75.144 was such an exemption. On appeal, the court found that the trial court correctly concluded that the language of &sect; 75.144 did not reveal by express language or necessary implication a legislative intent that the statute apply retroactively. Title to the property was taken by the county prior to the existence of &sect; 75.144. The trial court was correct in declaring plaintiffs' claim of adverse possession extinguished by the taking of a tax deed in 1986. However, the trial court failed to properly analyze the four enumerated exceptions to an order for sanctions in Wis. Stat. &sect; 804.12(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court on the adverse possession claim. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court on defendants' claim for expenses and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Marathon County (Wisconsin), which granted defendant company's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction an action for breach of a proprietary mutual exchange agreement, breach of an implied contract of confidentiality, violations of Wisconsin trade secret laws, and intentional misrepresentation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a Wisconsin corporation. Defendant had its principal place of business in New York. Plaintiff brought an action against defendant for breach of a proprietary mutual exchange agreement, breach of an implied contract of confidentiality, violations of Wisconsin trade secret laws, and intentional misrepresentation. Defendant moved to have the complaint dismissed due to lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court dismissed the complaint because it concluded that exercising personal jurisdiction over defendant would violate fair play and substantial justice. On appeal, the court found that Wisconsin had a significant interest in the outcome of the litigation because it directly bore upon the future of a Wisconsin company, the Wisconsin residents it employed, and perhaps the development of Wisconsin law. Further, plaintiff had an undeniable interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief for its claims. There was no dispute that defendant had significant minimum contacts with Wisconsin. Defendant did not demonstrate a compelling case that the burden of producing witnesses from New York was so grave as to violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Suspecting that defendant was attempting to ship contraband, employees of a private shipping company opened the box, found a duct-taped canister which they thought contained marijuana, and called police. After looking in the box, an officer conducted a field test and confirmed that the substance in the canister was marijuana. He then confiscated the package as contraband. The employees had the authority to examine what they considered to be a suspicious package. They properly contacted law enforcement, and the officer was authorized to replicate the search already conducted by the employees. The officer then got a warrant to search the return address listed by defendant on the package. However, the officer's affidavit did not state that he believed defendant was, or recently had been, engaged in any criminal activity at the residence. Although the affidavit contained probable cause to believe defendant possessed marijuana at the shipping company's facility, it provided no facts to link his possession to the residence. Given the absence of factual connections between crimes by defendant or others and the residence, no probable cause existed to search the residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision with respect to search of the box left with the shipping company, but reversed the portion of the trial court's decision upholding the search warrant for the residence.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed. In part, defendant challenged the entirety of what he described as a five-hour interview conducted in a county jail. Defendant however, cited nothing in the record to contradict the trial court's finding that his references to counsel were equivocal and thus insufficient to have constituted an invocation of the right to counsel. Additionally, a detective went to the jail to inform defendant that police had executed a search warrant at his apartment and to serve defendant with a copy of the warrant. While defendant read the warrant, he made spontaneous comments regarding a tackle box and some other matters. Defendant did not challenge those comments and the trial court properly concluded that they were spontaneous utterances, not obtained in violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the property owner's argument that City of Shawano, Wis., Zoning Code &sect; 10.06(5)(c) applied only to parking spaces a business was required to provide on site under City of Shawano, Wis., Zoning Code &sect; 10.05. So, for example, a restaurant in zone HB II is required to have one parking space per 150 square feet of floor area. The only way to explain the words &quot;required off-street parking spaces&quot; in City of Shawano, Wis., Zoning Code &sect; 10.06(5)(c) was as a reference to the sections requiring various amounts of off-street parking for different types of businesses found in City of Shawano, Wis., Zoning Code &sect; 10.05. Interpreting City of Shawano, Wis., Zoning Code &sect; 10.06(5)(c) as a stand-alone provision was not consistent with the use of the term &quot;required&quot; in City of Shawano, Wis., Zoning Code &sect; 10.06(5)(c) or with City of Shawano, Wis., Zoning Code &sect; 10.06(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was committed as a sexually violent person. The resolution of his case turned on the appellate court's interpretation and application of the newly enacted amendments to Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.08(4) to a particular set of facts. Defendant filed his petition seeking supervised release in March 2004, before the April 22, 2004, effective date of &sect; 980.08(4)(b)2. His hearing, however, had not yet been held. It was plain by the unambiguous language of 2003 Wis. Sess. Laws 187, &sect; 8, that Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.08(4)(b)2. applied to hearings commenced on the effective date of &sect; 980.08(4)(b)2. Because defendant's hearing on his petition had not commenced until after the effective date of the amendments, the new law was not retroactively applied to him. Because the appellate court concluded &sect; 980.08(4)(b)2. was not retroactively applied to defendant, it rejected his substantive due process challenge on the issue. The court did not reach the merits of defendant's other constitutional challenges because the circuit court applied the first ground under &sect; 980.08(4)(b) in denying defendant's petition and because defendant's facial constitutional challenges were moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment and an order of the circuit court for Marquette County (Wisconsin) where he was convicted based on no-contest pleas to misdemeanor charges of possession of tetrahydrocannabinols (THC), contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 961.41(3g)(e), and possession of drug paraphernalia, contrary to Wis. Stat. &sect; 961.573(1). He appealed the judgment of conviction and the circuit court's order denying his motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer stopped defendant because he believed defendant's driving privileges were cancelled. Following the stop, the officer searched defendant's vehicle and seized the THC and drug paraphernalia found in the car. The sole issue was whether the information the officer had when he stopped defendant that defendant's driver's license was cancelled was stale, such that the officer lacked reasonable suspicion to stop defendant. There was no dispute that this was the only reason the officer had to stop defendant. The court performed a Terry analysis and held that because the officer could not remember when he first learned that defendant's license was cancelled, and because, under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 343.25(7), 343.26, and 343.16(5)(b), defendant could have regained his license without the officer's knowledge, the officer's belief that defendant's license was still cancelled was unreasonable. In his testimony, the officer admitted that there was nothing suspicious about defendant's driving prior to the stop. The only reason he offered for stopping defendant was his &quot;prior knowledge&quot; that defendant's license had been suspended after an incident the previous summer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the circuit court's order denying defendant's suppression motion and the judgment of conviction. The cause was remanded with directions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the statements he gave at the hospital and in the squad car were unconstitutionally obtained because he had not been advised of his Miranda rights. The court of appeals disagreed. The police testified that defendant was not in custody at the hospital, that he was not handcuffed or restrained in any way, and that he was not considered a suspect at that time. Defendant contradicted that testimony, claiming he was handcuffed and believed that he was in custody. The testimony of the police supported the trial court's findings that defendant was not in custody when he spoke with police at the hospital. The trial court found that the statement that defendant made in the squad car about how to remove the casing was a voluntary statement he made after he saw the detective struggling to remove the casing. That statement was not the product of police interrogation. The detective did not ask defendant how to remove the casing; rather, defendant, on his own, shouted out the information to the officer. Therefore, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress his statements.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the appellate court held that the patient provided no citation of authority regarding an alleged mistake in testimony from his parole officer regarding a charge in Michigan. He was unable to object to statements in one expert's report because he did not link the statements to the jury verdict or contend that the expert should have been excluded as a witness based on these alleged falsities. The description of one offense was not more damaging than the conviction itself. Moreover, the patient waived his argument regarding certain evidence because there was no objection at trial. He also waived his claim that information was not produced during discovery. The claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was waived since it was not raised in a postconviction motion. Finally, Wis. Stat. ch. 980, as amended by 2003 Wis. Sess. Laws 187, was applicable to the patient, and it was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

He also appealed the order denying his post-commitment motion. The appellate court reluctantly concluded that although appellant's right to a speedy trial was not violated, it was very troubled that nearly six years elapsed from the filing of the petition to the beginning of his trial. And, because appellant's right to proceed pro se was improvidently revoked in violation of the Sixth Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, the appellate court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for a new trial. The appellate court was not convinced that appellant's behavior amounted to serious or obstructionist misconduct, and that his behavior was obstreperous and so disruptive that the trial was unable to move forward. The record did not reflect that the circuit court gave appellant very much, if any, leniency, which, as a pro se prisoner, the circuit court should have given him. Additionally, there was enough evidence to establish a substantial probability that appellant would have engaged in acts of sexual violence under Wis. Stat. &sect; 980.02 (2001-02).</SPAN></P>

The State filed a petition to detain him as a &quot;sexually violent person&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 980.01(7). A jury concluded that he was a sexually violent offender. The trial court ordered him committed to the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services. The trial court denied his post-commitment motion. On appeal, the court found that Wis. Stat. ch. 980 survived respondent's equal protection challenge under the strictest level of scrutiny. The jury was informed of respondent's two sexual assault convictions and the conduct underlying those convictions. They heard testimony from his parole agent about his rule violations while in the community. Two psychologists offered expert opinions that he suffered from a mental disorder that created a substantial probability that he would engage in acts of sexual violence in the future. Respondent had every opportunity to challenge the State's proof. No equal protection violation occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client was a former Wisconsin resident who was presently incarcerated in the California penal system for 15 counts of sexually assaulting minor girls. A trust retained the attorney to represent the client, in part, with respect to matters related to the trust and to assist in matters related to the multimillion dollar civil judgments the two young women victims had obtained based on the criminal conviction. The attorney was to focus on securing relief via a writ of habeas corpus. The attorney was fired in July 2003 and the client, a year later, filed an action against the attorney. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the attorney in the client's legal malpractice action. The appellate court affirmed, stating that there was no evidence to demonstrate that the client had any possibility of securing a new trial on all 15 convictions. Any conclusory assertions that, but for the attorney's actions, the client would have been a free man, were merely speculative. In regard to the return of attorney fees, the trustee of the trust was the proper party to hold the attorney responsible, not the beneficiary. The client was the beneficiary of the trust.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the father argued that he should be granted a new trial because he was entitled to a jury instruction stating that the jury was not to find grounds to terminate his parental rights due to his failure to meet conditions of return based solely on his incarceration. Nevertheless, a social worker testified that the father failed to complete an aftercare program and he made states that he did not need to attend a substance abuse recovery program.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993, the mother was convicted of first-degree sexual assault of a child and two counts of incest, for sexual abuse of her minor son. She was sentenced to nine months in jail and 10 years of probation. The rules of her probation prohibited her from having any contact with children, including her own. While on probation, she gave birth to two more children. She was arrested for violating the terms of her probation and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The trial court terminated her parental rights to the two children. On appeal, the court found that the application of Wis. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;48.415(2) to terminate her parental rights was sufficiently narrowly tailored to the facts presented. The mother's conditions of return were specifically tailored to her situation as a parent incarcerated for the sexual abuse of her minor son. The reason she could not meet the conditions of return imposed by the department was that she had been convicted of sexual abuse of a child and could not have contact with any children, including her own. Termination of her parental rights for failure to meet the conditions of return imposed by the department did not violate her substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that a violation of &sect; 125.075(1) was proven when a defendant was shown to have procured alcohol beverages for one or more persons who were under 18 years of age, if the defendant knew or should have known that the underage persons were under the legal drinking age and an underage person who was under eighteen when provided the beverages died as a result. In the instant case, the appellate court concluded that the evidence at trial was sufficient to establish that defendant knew or should have known that the alcohol beverages he procured for a party would be consumed by persons under the age of twenty-one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the inmate went on a hunger strike to protest the segregation conditions in the prison, the Department petitioned the trial court for permission to forcibly feed, hydrate, and medicate him. The trial court granted the Department's petition and later made its order permanent. On appeal, the court held that even though the inmate possessed a constitutionally-based liberty interest in avoiding unwanted forced nutrition and hydration under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Department could, under certain circumstances, infringe on the inmate's liberty interest by forcing him to ingest food and fluids against his will. However, the court held that the trial court erred by entering an indefinite, ostensibly permanent, ex parte order to involuntarily feed and hydrate the inmate. The trial court also erred by waiting for three weeks after entering the ex parte order to hold another court proceeding on the matter; it should have conducted an initial hearing as soon as reasonably possible. The inmate also should have been granted the right to an evidentiary hearing when he disputed the Department's allegations that he was refusing to drink fluids.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the early morning hours, defendant allegedly entered the bedroom of his ex-wife and struck her forehead with the claw end of a hammer approximately three times. The ex-wife suffered a skull fracture and a scalp laceration running from above her eyebrow to behind her ear. The amended information charged defendant with solicitation of first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless injury, aggravated battery, and mayhem. The mayhem and aggravated battery charges were alleged to have been committed in a school zone. The circuit court dismissed the mayhem charge because it concluded the statute was inapplicable to forehead injuries and dismissed the school zone enhancers because it concluded the statute was unconstitutional as applied. The appellate court ruled that the mayhem statute applied and that the school zone enhancer was not unconstitutional. The mayhem statute covered cutting or mutilation to the forehead, as the forehead, but not the entire head, could be considered an &quot;other bodily member&quot; under the mayhem statute. Also, the State offered multiple plausible reasons supporting the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 939.632 (2003-2004).</SPAN></P>

The trial court imposed a six-month suspension of his driver's license, fines, and costs. On appeal, defendant claimed that prohibiting his possession of marijuana for personal use in his home violated the protections afforded him under the Wisconsin and United States Constitutions. The court found that defendant provided no legal authority for treating, for purposes of the liberty interest protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, marijuana use in one's home the same as adult-consenting sexual conduct in one's home. Further, defendant's equal protection claim failed along with his substantive due process claim. Defendant's claim that his prosecution constituted involuntary servitude under the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 was without legal authority and was wholly lacking in merit. The same was true of his argument that his prosecution violated his right to pursue happiness guaranteed him by the Declaration of Independence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer raised multiple challenges to a town ordinance containing a provision relating to the transfer of development rights (TDR). The developer attempted to subdivide property into residential lots. The developer subsequently failed in his attempt to develop his land because he could not meet the TDR requirements of the town ordinance. The developer sought to have the town ordinance declared unconstitutional on various grounds and sought other relief, including approval of his plat and compensation for the alleged taking of his property. The appellate court ruled that the lawsuit was ripe for adjudication and therefore was justiciable. The developer had availed himself of the rezoning and plat approval process, but failed because he could not meet the TDR requirements. The developer was permitted to test the validity of the town's ordinance before incurring substantial financial liabilities. It was sufficient that the town would continue to apply the ordinance's TDR requirements to any future plat approval the developer sought, since his property was in a receiving area subject to those requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) convicting him of possession of cocaine and an order denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from a search of his person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acting on a tip from an anonymous caller, police officer went to a bar, frisked defendant, and found several rocks of cocaine. Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine after the trial court denied his motion to suppress. On appeal, the court held that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion to conduct the investigatory stop of defendant, and therefore the resulting search and seizure of the cocaine was unconstitutional, because the anonymous tip did not have the indicia of reliability required under the J.L., White, and Williams cases, and was not otherwise justified by exigent circumstances or based on suspicious conduct independently observed by the officers. When they made the investigative stop of defendant, the officers had only the following information: (1) defendant's name; (2) the fact that he was a black male; (3) he was wearing a black wool waist-length coat and a black winter hat; (4) he was at a bar at a particular location; and (5) he was in possession of drugs. The printout of the dispatch record provided no height or weight information, and the height and weight information provided by the caller was extremely inaccurate as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 980 (2003-2004) and denying his motion for reconsideration and a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On April 19, 2004, the State petitioned to have appellant committed as a sexually violent person under Wis. Stat. ch. 980. Between the time the State filed the petition and the time the circuit court found appellant to be a sexually violent person, the definition of sexually violent person changed. With the passage of 2003 Wis. Act 187, the Wisconsin Legislature changed just two words in the definition of sexually violent person, substituting &quot;likely&quot; for &quot;substantially probable.&quot; The circuit court found appellant to be a sexually violent person under the new &quot;likely&quot; standard and committed him. Appellant challenged the recently modified definition of &quot;sexually violent person&quot; on both substantive due process and equal protection grounds. The appellate court found that none of appellant's arguments persuaded it beyond a reasonable doubt that Wis. Stat. ch. 980, as amended by 2003 Wis. Act 187, was unconstitutional on substantive due process or equal protection grounds. The new definition lowered the level of dangerousness required for commitment from &quot;substantially probable&quot; to &quot;likely&quot; to engage in an act of sexual violence.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Eau Claire County (Wisconsin) held that the appropriate standard to be applied was the best interests of the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the guardianship should have been terminated absent a finding that she was unfit or unable to care for the child or that other compelling reasons required guardianship.

The appellate court rejected the grandparents' attempt to distinguish the applicable judicial precedent where they conceded that they were essentially arguing that the judicial precedent was wrongly decided. The appellate court was without power to overrule a published opinion of the court of appeals. Since that judicial precedent controlled the results in this case, the circuit court's order was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an inmate, sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of armed robbery with threat of force as party to a crime in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 943.32(2) and 939.05 (2003-04), sentenced him to a 10-year term, and denied his postconviction motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that the trial court erroneously exercised its sentencing discretion by imposing an excessive sentence and one that was disparate to that of a co-actor. He had pled guilty to armed robbery with threat of force as party to a crime in violation of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 943.32(2) and 939.05 (2003-04) and he had received a 10-year sentence, consisting of five years of initial confinement followed by five years of extended supervision. His postconviction motion was denied and the appellate court affirmed. In its imposition, the trial court considered the seriousness of the offense, as well as the inmate's character, past criminal record and the need to protect the public from such criminal behavior. His sentence was not excessive because he received only one-quarter of the maximum potential sentence. It was also clear that the trial court properly assessed the individual factors pertinent to the inmate and a co-actor. The factors were very different between the two and supported the trial court's sentencing discretion. In part, the inmate had a pattern of violent criminal behavior. The co-actor did not and was going to college, whereas the inmate was &quot;drifting in life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owner sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Columbia County (Wisconsin), which dismissed the owner's claim against defendants a town and the town board. The owner had filed an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 alleging an equal protection violation when the town decided to veto the owner's rezoning petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner alleged that the town board filed a disapproval of his rezoning petitions before the county board had acted on the owner's proposed rezoning and that the town's actions were without legitimate governmental reason or purpose and were irrational, arbitrary, and capricious, and in violation of his right to equal protection under the United States Constitution. The court held that the trial court correctly limited its decision to the final disapproval because that was the only disapproval that actually caused the harm for which plaintiff sought damages. The town's prior disapprovals had no effect at all on the final outcome of the owner's rezoning attempt, because the county board eventually approved the owner's ordinance in spite of the town's expressed disapprovals. The trial court had found that the owner had not pointed to any similar parcels that had been zoned from agricultural to residential in the area near plaintiff's property. The court concluded that the owner had not shown that it was clearly erroneous for the trial court to find that the owner did not establish that he was treated differently from similarly situated owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father claimed that Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(2) (2003-04), violated his right to substantive due process, as applied to him, because a finding of unfitness as grounds for termination of parental rights was based on an impossible condition of return. He also claimed that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that he was an unfit parent and that the trial court erred in determining that it was in the child's best interest to terminate his parental rights. In affirming, the court held that (1) Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(2) was not unconstitutional as applied because the conditions for return were made based on an individualized assessment of the father's parenting abilities, which were seriously deficient; (2) the trial court properly applied the factors of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.415(2), and the father did not show that the trial court's conclusion was clearly erroneous under Wis. Tat. Rule 805.17(2); and (3) the trial court's decision that termination was in the child's best interest was proper as it was thorough and discussed every Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.426 factor in great detail, while the father's argument against termination failed to challenge the trial court's application of those factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neighbor filed a petition seeking to enjoin appellant from harassing her. At trial, the neighbor testified that appellant yelled at her and threatened her with police involvement over a noisy muffler on her car, appellant called her landlord and the police to complain about her, appellant appeared at her place of employment and yelled at her and threatened her, appellant called the police to complain about loud music at the neighbor's house, appellant made numerous telephone calls to her, and on two occasions, appellant drove quickly down the street toward the neighbor such that the neighbor, who was carrying her baby on one occasion, felt threatened and unsafe. The court noted that the evidence before the circuit court indicated that appellant's harassing contact with the neighbor took many forms. The court stated that an order enjoining all contact was not overbroad if it was based on diverse types of conduct. Constitutionally protected activity could be enjoined if such a limitation was necessary to end the harassing behavior. Because appellant's harassment of the neighbor took several forms, enjoining all contact was within the circuit court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment and an order of the circuit court for Shawano County (Wisconsin) that convicted him of operating with a prohibited alcohol concentration, sixth offense, and denied his postconviction motion. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred by permitting the State to question him concerning his failure to call his mother as a witness and his post-arrest failure to contact police with his version of events.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sister called police to report that defendant was intoxicated and causing a verbal disturbance. When police arrived, they saw defendant's van parked across a driveway and asked him questions about how he got home. Defendant told police a friend drove him home, but the friend denied it when police called to check defendant's story. Defendant was arrested and taken to a hospital for a blood test, where he told police that 2 other people had driven him home. An officer read defendant the pre-interrogation warning from the alcohol report form, and he then declined to answer questions. At trial, defendant testified that he drank shots of his mother's whiskey after he arrived home, and the State questioned him about his failure to call his mother as a witness and to tell police his version of events. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court decision, holding that although the State erred by asking defendant a question about his post-Miranda silence as to his version of the events, the impermissible question elicited the same information as a permissible question on his pre-Miranda silence about having drinks after he arrived home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested, he petitioned for an appointed attorney, alleging that he had been rejected by the public defender but could not afford to retain an attorney. An attorney was appointed to represent him. The attorney was to be paid by the county, and defendant would be liable to the county for amounts expended on his behalf. Defendant pled guilty to two counts. After his attorney submitted his bill, one of the judgments of conviction was amended to require the payment of $ 919 in attorney fees. No hearing was ever held to determine whether defendant was able to pay the attorney fees. When defendant still owed $ 465 on his attorney fee obligation, the trial court issued an order authorizing his commitment to the county jail for 33 days. On appeal, the court concluded that the United States Constitution required the trial court to determine ability to pay at some point prior to commitment for failure to pay attorney fees. Wisconsin's recoupment statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.07 (2003-04), required a hearing to make that determination. No such finding was made at sentencing, at the time defendant's fees were set, or at the time the commitment order was issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the case with directions to vacate the commitment order.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 980, regarding sexually violent offenders. The inmate ordered a book of photographs of families, and the center denied him possession of that book. The Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) granted summary judgment in favor of the center. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The center provided the court with a copy of the policy that the inmate was questioning in an affidavit in support of their summary judgment motion. The policy, broadly described, set forth a process for reviewing reading materials and pictures that were sent to or in possession of residents of the center, and prohibited possession of &quot;contraband&quot; or &quot;counter-therapeutic material.&quot; The center asserted they were following and applying that policy in denying the inmate possession of the book he ordered. Affidavits by center staff explained that the inmate was not permitted to receive the book because it was regarded as counter-therapeutic. According to the affidavits, the photographs of children in it could be perceived as erotic by those residents of the center who were sexually attracted to children. The inmate argued that the policy, or its application was an improper attempt at &quot;mind control&quot; by the center. He assembled that argument from passages in various cases concerning potentially obscene materials. But, none of the cases he cited came even close to holding that a committed person such as the inmate had a constitutional right to possess material deemed counter-therapeutic.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a doctor and his insurance company, challenged decision of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin awarding respondents, the deceased's estate and the deceased's parents, damages in their survival and wrongful death action under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 895.01, 894.04 respectively. Respondents cross-appealed the trial court's reduction in the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted declaratory judgment that the Wisconsin Patients Compensation Fund's liability was not triggered. The court held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 893.55(4) did not apply to the doctor because she was a first-year medical resident and, thus, not a health care provider under Wis. Stat. ch. 655. It followed that, pursuant to the primary policy, the doctor was independently insured under the umbrella policy, and she was not insured under it only subject to vicarious liability by the hospital. Therefore, the fund's liability was not triggered. The court also held that here was no evidence supporting the contention that the doctor was a borrowed employee. Although the trial court properly refused to order the production of the settlement agreement, it should have conducted an in camera review of the actual document prior to ruling on the motion because it was unclear whether the agreement was a Pierringer release; thus remand on that issue was ordered. Appellants' accusation that the parents' loss of society and companionship was an impermissible award for emotional distress in disguise was nothing more than an unsupported speculation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded and ordered that a settlement agreement be produced by respondents to the insurer. The court otherwise affirmed as to the appeal and cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that there was a rational basis for not allowing persons convicted of crimes under Wis. Stat. ch. 940 to participate in the earned release program. Excluding persons whose conduct caused death or great bodily harm from the opportunity to reduce their period of confinement by participation in the earned release program was rationally related to the legitimate government purpose of punishing more serious crimes more severely. The court also determined that the circuit court did not erroneously rely on defendant's statements given in a television interview with defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Douglas County (Wisconsin), which denied his motion to suppress evidence and convicted him of misdemeanor possession of marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers walked through an apartment building and located a very strong odor of marijuana coming from an apartment. The officers informed defendant that the police were at his door. An officer heard noises that sounded like things being moved in the apartment and believed the noises were defendant's attempts to hide or destroy evidence inside the room. The officer kicked at the door, ordering defendant to open the door. When defendant opened the door, the officer could see controlled substances in plain view. Defendant was convicted of misdemeanor possession of marijuana. On appeal, the court found that while a misdemeanor offense could justify a warrantless entry due to exigent circumstances, the exigent circumstances in defendant's case were impermissibly created by the police. The police gave no reason why they could not secure a warrant before entering the apartment. Before the police knocked on the door, there was no threat of destruction of the evidence. The police impermissibly created an exigency and then used that exigency to justify their warrantless entry. Such action ran contrary to the intent of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and the order denying his motion to suppress. The court remanded the case with directions that all evidence obtained in, and derived from, the unlawful search of defendant's home be ordered suppressed, and that defendant's guilty plea be withdrawn.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Wisconsin Legislature and municipalities, challenged a judgment of the circuit court for Dane County (Wisconsin) that denied their motions to intervene as a matter of right under Wis.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 40.02(20) and 103.10&nbsp;unconstitutionally denied state employee health insurance benefits and family leave to same-sex partners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Legislature claimed it was entitled to intervene because it had a significant interest in establishing and defending its public policy decision not to provide domestic partner benefits and to balance the budget. The municipalities also argued that they should have been joined sua sponte as necessary and indispensable parties. The court held that appellants failed to meet the statutory requirements for intervention as of right. The court found that the Legislature failed to show it had an interest sufficiently related to the employees' action or that such an interest would have been impaired by a ruling in the action; and that the municipalities' interests were adequately represented by the existing parties in the case. Also appellants were not entitled to permissive intervention because the Legislature did not have a &quot;defense&quot; within the meaning of Wis. Stat. &sect; 803.09(2); and allowing the municipalities to intervene would result in undue delay from the proposed certification of a class action. The court concluded that the municipalities were not necessary parties under Wis. Stat. &sect; 803.03(1)(b) and failed to develop their argument for joinder under Wis. Stat. &sect; 806.04(11).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed an order by the Circuit Court for Dane County, Wisconsin, dismissing his petition for certiorari review of a prison disciplinary decision, and an order denying reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While incarcerated the inmate received a conduct report charging him with possessing contraband and with engaging in gang related activities. Specifically, the report alleged that the inmate possessed a letter mailed to him referring to activities of a known gang and a notebook recording the inmate's correspondence with gang members. A disciplinary committee found the inmate guilty of violating Wis. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; DOC 303.20(3) and 303.47(2)(a). The committee found that his notebook and the letter contained references to gang activity and allowed an inference that inmate participated in gang related activity. The inmate's writ of certiorari alleged, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to find he participated in gang activity, the decision was arbitrary and capricious, and the proceeding violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. V. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the inmate's petition under Wis. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;802.05(3)(b)4 (2003-04) as the court relied on the documents and testimony to find that the evidence supported the committee's findings and that the any limitations on the inmate's First Amendment rights were reasonably related to limiting gang activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff land owner initiated a claim against defendant county to obtain a declaratory judgment that his special exception use permit was valid and transferable. He also sought judgment that the ownership clause of an ordinance was invalid and severable. The county counterclaimed. The Circuit Court for St. Croix County, Wisconsin, entered a summary judgment order and declaratory judgment enforcing the commercial zoning of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land owner owned a parcel of land in a town that was located in the county. The land owner used his land for commercial purposes since 1971, although the land was not then zoned for commercial use. On appeal, the appellate court agreed with the county's argument that St. Croix County, Wisconsin, Ordinance 108(85) was not severable because without the ownership clause, the ordinance did not present a complete law intended by the county board. Thus, the entire ordinance failed. The land owner, on the other hand, argued that the clause had to be severed pursuant to the local zoning code. Nevertheless, if the ownership clause were excised, the ordinance would be given an effect clearly not intended. A special exception use permit could not allow a use of property that contravenes its zoning, and thus the permit was invalid. Because the Ordinance 108(85) was invalid, the lot was correctly zoned agricultural residential. Thus, because a special exception use permit could not allow a use incompatible with or adverse to the underlying zoning ordinance, the land owner's permit for a truck repair shop and transfer point in an area zoned agricultural residential was necessarily invalid.</SPAN></P>
