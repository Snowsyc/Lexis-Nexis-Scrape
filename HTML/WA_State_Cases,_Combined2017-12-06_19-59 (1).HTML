</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer challenged a decision of the Superior Court (Washington) that denied his petition under the Land Use Petition Act, challenging respondent county's approval of the preliminary plat of respondent neighbor on the ground that the developer had sufficient notice of the public hearing on the neighbor's plat approval but did not have standing to appeal the hearing examiner's decision because he was not a party of record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer claimed that the public notice of the hearing was misleading, and thus defective, because it included a plan that showed a road connecting to his property that was later deleted. The developer also argued that the county should have required his neighbor to build a cross-circulation road allowing access to the developer's property as a condition for approval, and additional frontage improvements on an access street.  The court held that the developer had standing to appeal the hearing examiner's decision because the developer became a party of record when he signed a sign-in sheet that was titled with the general subject matter. The court also found that the county provided sufficient notice of the hearing because any defect in the initial notice was cured when the county provided the amended plat proposal at the first public hearing. The court held that hearing examiner did not err by not requiring the neighbor to build a cross-circulation road because the road would not serve a public purpose, thus the county could not constitutionally require it as a condition for approving the plat. The court found that the developer waived the issue of the frontage requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denying defendant's motions to sever offenses, the trial court of the State of Washing convicted defendant of raping his five year old neighbor but acquitted him of raping his six year old son. Defendant was given an indeterminate sentence of 108 months to life in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court's refusal to sever the offenses required a new trial. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the trial court's conscientious evaluation of the relevant factors and subsequent ruling was not an abuse of discretion. Further, the trial court expressly reserved Wash. R. Evid. 404(b) rulings and came to the conclusion that severance should be denied even if much of the evidence was not cross-admissible. Defendant pointed to no portion of the record at which the trial court told the jury which evidence related to which count. Defendant's statement that he may have accidentally touched the neighbor did not change defendant's defense of general denial. The jury persuasively demonstrated that it could put aside propensity inferences by acquitting defendant of raping his son. There was no reasonable probability that the jury would have acquitted defendant on the count regarding the neighbor had the trial court granted the motion to sever; thus, any such error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

The victim did not testify at trial. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment rights by admitting into evidence the victim's hearsay statements to her rescuers as excited utterances because the statements were not testimonial. The victim's statements were made while she was under the stress of the recent kidnapping and assault, the rescuers were not involved in law enforcement, and there was no indication that the victim made the statements for prosecutorial purposes, especially in light of her refusal to involve law enforcement. Even though the trial court violated defendant's Sixth Amendment rights by admitting into evidence the victim's statements to medical treatment providers, as those statements were testimonial, the error was harmless because they were almost entirely cumulative of the more detailed and properly admitted statements to the rescuers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of a trial court (Washington), which sentenced him following his conviction of attempted first degree burglary. Defendant argued that the trial court lacked statutory authority to empanel a jury to determine whether he was armed with a firearm at the time of that crime, a fact that resulted in the imposition of a sentencing enhancement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the firearm enhancement was completely invalid because the trial court submitted the special verdict question to the jury without specific legislative authority. On appeal, the court noted that defendant did not object to the trial court's special verdict procedure below. Because defendant's claim was statutory error, not constitutional error, defendant failed to preserve the issue as set forth in Wash. R. App. P. 2.5(a) and waived any claim of error. The court next agreed that the sentencing court improperly imposed a 60-month instead of a 36-month enhancement. The required firearm enhancement for a class B felony was 36 months pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.533(3)(b). The trial court erred when it instead imposed the 60-month enhancement required for class A felonies pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.533(3)(a). Attempted first degree burglary was a class B felony, not a class A felony, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect;&nbsp;9A.28.020(3)(b), 52.020(2). The court then determined that the trial court erred by adding a period of community custody to his sentence in an ex parte procedure without notice a day after the contested sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the firearm enhancement special verdict and remanded the case for imposition of the correct firearm sentence enhancement of 36 months and for an adversarial hearing on the State's proposed sentence modifications, including community custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus by the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington) after his suspended sentences for driving under the influence (DUI) and drug charges were revoked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that the inmate had made no attempt to comply with the treatment requirements for the three years of probation, the trial court revoked the suspended sentences on all cause numbers, imposed all remaining time, and ordered that the terms be served consecutively. The remaining time totaled approximately 44 months. The inmate argued that his total sentence constituted cruel punishment in violation of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The court of appeals disagreed. Among other specifics of the inmate's extensive history of noncompliance, he had attended a probation interview while intoxicated. The inmate's crimes included three DUIs and hit and run. Those were offenses that threatened or caused injury to persons or property. The inmate's repeated failure to complete substance abuse treatment also related to public safety, given that he seemed determined to drive while intoxicated. The inmate served consecutive time only because he consistently failed to take steps that might have lessened the threat he posed to persons and property. Therefore, the sentences were not grossly disproportionate to the offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged a judgment of the trial court (Washington) that denied the city's motion and granted respondent business taxpayer's motion for summary judgment in the taxpayer's action seeking a refund of business and occupation (B&amp;O) taxes imposed under Seattle, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 5.45.050 on the entire gross income of the taxpayer, which included income generated outside the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed the city had improperly attempted to tax income derived from activities outside the city's borders; and that the city's different treatment of the commissions for stockbrokers and real estate brokers violated the federal and state equal protection clauses. The court found that although the taxpayer did not maintain &quot;offices&quot; outside the city, it was undisputed that some of its registered representatives generated sales outside the city and the state. The court held that the city's attribution of the entire proceeds of the taxpayer's registered representatives to the taxpayer's city office merely because that was the taxpayer's sole office violated the external consistency requirement of federal commerce clause jurisprudence. Rather, the taxpayer was entitled to apportionment to ensure that the city taxed only its fair share of income generated within the city. The court rejected the taxpayer's claim that the city's tax violated equal protection, holding that a classification based solely on a difference in the method of operation of a particular kind of business was permissible. The court found that neither party had correctly identified the measure of the tax.</SPAN></P>

In the alternative, defendant argued that the State failed to prove the out-of-state California convictions for burglary and receiving stolen property were comparable to a Washington crime. The appellate court held that the trial court did not deprive defendant of his constitutional and due process rights to a jury trial by engaging in a limited fact finding to determine comparability between an out-of-state conviction and the in-state convictions. However, the appellate court did vacate defendant's sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing because based on the record before it, the appellate court could not tell if defendant stipulated or admitted to an unlawful entry for his California convictions pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&nbsp;459. Thus, the State did not meet its burden that the 1980 or 1982 California burglary convictions were factually comparable to Washington's burglary statute.

Although the appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling denying the motion to dismiss because it was not barred by the statute of limitations, the trial court had to determine whether it was in the best interests of the child for the parentage action to continue. The appellate court did not decide whether Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.26.530 was unconstitutional for another day when the issue was properly before it. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in appointing a guardian ad litem for the child, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.26.555(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant participated in three home invasion robberies. In each instance, an accomplice was armed with a firearm. Defendant argued that the trial court was without authority to impose the enhancement, because there was no authorized procedure for submitting the firearm question to the jury. The appellate court overruled defendant's argument that there was no procedure in place for the imposition of a firearm enhancement and none could be judicially created, finding that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.602 amply authorized the firearm finding. To the extent express authority was required, the deadly weapon special verdict statute supplied it. Also, the appellate court overruled defendant's assertion that under the U.S. Supreme Court Blakely decision, imposition of multiple firearm enhancements violated double jeopardy. A jury found defendant guilty on each count and entered a special verdict finding that defendant or an accomplice was armed with a firearm at the time of the crimes. This procedure complied fully with the U.S. Supreme Court Blakely decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the trial court (Washington), which convicted defendant of two counts of first-degree rape of a child, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.073. Defendant challenged certain evidentiary decisions related to the hearsay statements made by the alleged victim, defendant's five-year-old nephew.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of first-degree rape of his five-year old nephew. After a pre-trial determination was made, the court allowed into evidence out-of-court statements made by the nephew to his mother, his grandmother, and a child interview specialist, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120. Additionally, the nephew, who was six at the time of trial, testified about the alleged incident, but claimed that he had forgotten about specifics. The court held that defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause, as set forth in U.S. Const. amend. VI and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22, were not violated. The nephew's testimony about the alleged sexual contact and his hearsay statements to the three other witnesses adequately met the requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120 and the Confrontation Clause. The court held that the prosecutor's statements during closing, even if based on impermissible hearsay, were not so flagrant that they could not have been neutralized through an admonition. It was not error for the trial court to replay the DVD to the jury on one occasion at their request. Defendant's sentence as a persistent offender was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the revocation by the Superior Court of Kitsap County, Washington of his special sex offender sentencing alternative (SSOSA) under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(8)(a)(ii) (1997) and reinstatement of his 97.5-month standard range sentence after his community corrections officer (CCO) discovered a marijuana-growing operation in defendant's backyard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the CCO was visiting defendant where he lived with his mother, the CCO looked into a tool shed with defendant's permission and discovered the operation. When police searched the residence, they found pornographic materials. The court affirmed and held that any error in admitting testimony of the CCO from an incident report that the officers found pornography in the laundry room was clearly harmless because defendant admitted that he violated the conditions of his SSOSA by possessing triple X videos. Defendant's admission verified the hearsay statement, and the trial court did not rely on unverified evidence in making its decision to revoke his SSOSA. Further, defendant's due process rights to adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard were protected. The court also held that the applicable revocation standard, former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(8)(a)(vi), did not require the court to consider the violating offender's best interests. Because defendant was on SSOSA, his sentence was suspended under &sect; 9.94A.120(8)(a)(ii), and &sect; 9.94A.120(8)(a)(vi) required that he receive credit for &quot;confinement time&quot; upon revocation, not for the time he spent in community custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for misdemeanor harassment by the trial court, Washington.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facts revealed that after defendant started dating the victim, he sprayed &quot;Oust&quot; air freshener into her eyes.  The next day, he threw hot coffee on her back. When she tried to call the police to report his abuse, he told her, &quot;You're done, you're going to die,&quot; and he ran his finger across his throat. Defendant was charged with fourth degree felony harassment--threats to kill (domestic violence) contrary to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020(1)(a)(i) and .020(2)(b). Despite charging defendant with harassment contrary only to &sect; 9A.46.020(1)(a)(i), the court instructed the jury that a person committed the crime of harassment when he or she violated &sect; 9A.46.020(1)(a)(i) or &sect; 9A.46.020(1)(a)(iv). Thus, the trial court's &quot;to convict&quot; instruction included &sect; 9A.46.020(1)(a)(iv) as an alternative means for convicting defendant. The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded for a new trial because &sect; 9A.46.020(1)(a)(iv) was not a lesser included offense of &sect;&nbsp;9A.46.020(1)(a)(i) as it contained elements that were not necessary for &sect;&nbsp;9A.46.020(1)(a)(i). As the State offered no evidence that the instructional error was not harmless, it was presumed to be prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1996, Washington voters approved Initiative 655, which made it a gross misdemeanor to take, hunt, or attract black bears with bait, or to hunt bears, cougars, bobcat or lynx with dogs. The legislature codified Initiative 655 at Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 77.15.245. Defendants argued that the initiative violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19, by embracing more than one subject and by failing to express the initiative's subject in its title. The court concluded that the initiative's title was general. The initiative's incidental subjects banned different specific methods of hunting different animals; they differed only in the specific prohibited hunting methods and the targeted animals. Thus, the incidental subjects were sufficiently related to satisfy the single subject rule of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. The court also concluded that the initiative did not violate the subject-in-title rule of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. A voter would understand from the initiative's title that penalties, including license suspensions, would likely follow from hunting black bear with bait or hunting bear, cougar, bobcat, or lynx using dogs.</SPAN></P>

Next, the employer met the two tests to show that the two classes of adjusters were exempt from the MWA's overtime exemptions. Under the duties test, the adjusters were administrative under Wash. Admin. Code &sect;&nbsp;296-128-520(1), (3) because they performed office work directly related to business operations, and they customarily and regularly exercised discretion and independent judgment. As to the salary basis test, the adjusters were salaried employees, despite the contention that certain deductions were taken. Further, the reclassification of other adjusters was not relevant to the case. Finally, the trial court did not err by clarifying the class because of the three-year statute of limitations under Wash. Rev.

Code &sect; 9A.36.021(1)(c), stated that a defendant was guilty of assault if he assaulted another with a deadly weapon. Because the statute did not define assault, courts supplied the common law definition. Consistent with their history, the legislative and judicial branches cooperated in defining the offense of assault. The juvenile presented no authority to show that the established practice was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the deputies did not have a specific, articulable reason to justify his warrantless detention. He also argued that his arrest was unlawful. The appellate court noted that the deputies did not stop the vehicle due to suspicions directed at defendant. The deputies testified that they thought the bubble van had been used for illicit drug deliveries and that another person was the driver. The deputies based their suspicions on tips from a confidential informant, the complaints of neighbors, and their own surveillance. The deputies' suspicion that the other person was driving the van and that he had been or was currently engaged in criminal conduct was reasonable. This suspicion justified a stop of the van to identify the driver and conduct a brief investigation. For defendant to argue that his arrest for driving while license suspended in the third degree was invalid, he had to show that his license was suspended for the one reason under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.342(1) that could be unconstitutional under Moore, but defendant did not do so. The fact that defendant was driving while his license was suspended was sufficient to establish probable cause for his arrest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not show either deficient performance or prejudice. Defendant waived her due process argument that she did not receive a written copy of the amended information by failing to request one. Defendant did not show the second trial occurred outside the speedy trial period applicable to the initial charge. The two offenses were not the &quot;same conduct&quot; for purposes of mandatory joinder. Sufficient evidence showed that defendant failed to provide the victim with contractually required basic hygiene, a basic necessity of life under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.42.010(1). The jury could find that defendant knew the victim was being neglected and failed to report it. The trial court merely restated the prior instructions and did not suggest to the jury the decision it ought to reach. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.42.010 was not unconstitutional as the terms of defendant's contract were clear.</SPAN></P>

In reversing, the appellate court found that the father did not forfeit his right to counsel by not seeking a more timely appointment of counsel and by failing to appear at trial. The father had a right to counsel in the termination proceedings under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.090(2) based on his fundamental liberty interest in the care and custody of his children under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;3 and the Fourteenth Amendment. A forfeiture of this right was only found in cases involving serious misconduct or extremely dilatory conduct. Next, the father had the right to effective representation under Wash. Rev.

The jury found that he was a sexually violent predator, and the trial court ordered him committed. The court affirmed on appeal, stating that although it was error to admit a doctor's hypothetical under Wash. R. Evid. 702 and 703, the error was harmless. There was more than sufficient evidence to support the State's burden of proving, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(16), beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined to a security facility. Using the proper scoring rules, the three actuarial tests that the doctor used predicted that the likelihood appellant would reoffend was 52 percent, 73 percent, and 75 percent. Those percentages were more than enough to prove that he was likely to reoffend. The altered scores only raised the later two scores by 15 percent and 25 percent respectively.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Washington charged respondent with felony forgery, and she was taken into custody during a traffic stop in Montana, her state of residence. Respondent posted bail and traveled to Washington to appear for arraignment and a bail hearing. In Washington, respondent asked for release on her personal recognizance because she was a victim of identity theft, and had already posted $ 10,000 bail when arrested on the charge in Montana. The superior court denied the request, imposed bail of $ 5,000, and ordered that she be taken into custody. The county conducted an automatic strip search in accordance with its policy based on Wash. Rev. Code ch. 10.79. After determining that respondent was the innocent victim of identity theft, and not a forger, the county dropped the forgery charges against her. The appellate court ruled that respondent did not meet the statutory criteria for a warrantless strip search, and therefore, the county acted without authorization in strip searching her under its automatic strip search policy. A person in custody pending release on bail was entitled to the protections of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 10.79.130 through 10.79.160.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, denied the father's petition, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the father contended the trial court erred in deciding that he had no visitation rights with his stepdaughter based on a ruling from a prior supreme court ruling. The appellate court agreed, finding that the father already had an order allowing visitation, the one issued in the dissolution action. That is, without running awry of the prior ruling in question, the father could enforce the original parenting plan order because it had not been amended or vacated, and because he had exercised his visitation rights since the parenting plan was ordered. Furthermore, given the important role the father played during his stepdaughter's formative years and his exercise of his visitation rights since the dissolution, the appellate court could not terminate his visitation rights without good reason. Such an abrupt severance of a familial relationship would only entail inequitable consequences. Accordingly, the prior ruling in question did not retroactively revoke the father's visitation rights under his parenting plan. Absent finding that it was no longer in the stepdaughter's best interest, the father should have been allowed to exercise his visitation rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings to enforce the father's visitation rights under the prior parenting plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was murdered in February 1997, and since July 1994, there have been six referrals to State authorities on behalf of the children in Washington and two referrals in Texas alleging physical abuse and neglect, medical neglect, sexual abuse, and drug use. The mother argued Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 13.34.180 and 13.34.190, were facially unconstitutional. The appellate court ruled that because Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 13.34.180 and 13.34.190 required the State to prove in every instance that its request to terminate parental rights was based on prevention of harm or risk of harm to children, they survived strict scrutiny and were constitutional. Also, the trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights. The uncertainty of the mother's success and the considerable time necessary to complete the necessary services were significant obstacles that clearly diminish the children's prospects for long-term integration and permanence. There was little likelihood that conditions would be remedied so that the children could be returned to the mother in the near future.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a Washington trial court convicted defendant of malicious mischief in the second degree, defendant moved for a new trial and arrest of judgment. The trial court denied defendant's motion, reiterating that the State met its burden of proving that defendant was not legally justified in cutting down his neighbors' gate and that he acted maliciously in doing so. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence of malice to support the conviction, that pursuant to his easement he had a right to enter on his neighbors' property and cut the gate down, and that he attempted to gain access by other means by cutting the lock off the gate, but this attempt proved futile. Thus, defendant claimed he was acting within his legal rights when he cut down the locked gate because it was an unreasonable burden upon the easement. The appellate court agreed, finding that while the neighbors owned the land on which the easement was located, they did not have the right to unreasonably interfere with defendant's use of the easement. By locking the gate, the neighbors unreasonably interfered with the easement and defendant had a right to gain access. There was no requirement that defendant had to resort to other legal process before attempting to gain access to his easement. Further, substantial evidence did not exist to support the finding that defendant threw or tossed the gate against the neighbors' house after cutting it down. Thus, the conclusion that defendant acted with malice was unsupported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer sought to build two small free-standing hotels on island property that was zoned rural village. The developer submitted a site plan application and requested a zoning code interpretation to permit the plan to go forward. The county planning department rejected both, and the hearing examiner affirmed. A second interpretation request was also rejected. The lower court reversed and remanded for further interpretations. The court agreed with the county that the decision of the lower court needed to be overturned and the decision of the hearing officer reinstated, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.130(1)(a). The hearing officer properly applied the doctrine of res judicata to the matters that were before him, because the second code interpretation request was the same as the first that had been rejected. The court also found that the developer's constitutional claim should not have been remanded because the agency was without authority to rule on a constitutional question. There was no violation of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, because an earlier &quot;spot zoning&quot; decision on another island did not justify additional spot rezoning in favor of the developer.</SPAN></P>

The city subsequently denied the request for variances filed by the trust and the residents, and the lower court upheld the denial. Affirming, the court held that the playhouse was subject to the city's zoning code because it met the definition of a structural coverage under Medina, Wash. Code &sect; 17.12.010(B), and did not fall within one of the seven specifically enumerated exceptions for a structure. The trust was not entitled to a variance because the seven conditions enumerated in Medina, Wash. Code &sect; 2.78.065(A) were not met. The court also rejected the trust's arguments that others in the vicinity enjoyed greater property rights over the trust or that the public welfare required the variance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his molestation and rape convictions, but the court affirmed. Because the child interview specialist and the police detective did not explicitly say they believed the younger victim, any error in admitting their testimony was not manifest constitutional error that could be raised for the first time on appeal. Additionally, the trial court's evidentiary rulings were not an abuse of discretion; there was not a substantial likelihood the outcome of the two trials was affected by improper arguments of the prosecutor, and defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a fair trial. The trial court's decision to prohibit contact with his wife, the victim's mother, as a condition of his sentence, was not an unconstitutional restriction. The detective was permitted to testify under Wash. R. Evid. 701 based on her observations of the wife. Testimony about the wife's reaction of being more protective of defendant than concerned about the younger victim's allegations offered an alternative explanation about the timing of the disclosures and why the younger victim did not tell her mother about the abuse.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant was not denied his right to counsel on direct appeal. Appointed counsel and the appellate court followed the Anders procedure -- counsel was permitted to withdraw only after counsel and the appellate court reviewed the trial record, counsel and defendant each filed briefing, the appellate court reviewed those briefs, and the appellate court affirmed the convictions. The failure of the appellate court and counsel to notice a ministerial error in the judgment and sentence did not vitiate the procedural safeguards that were followed or render the appeal otherwise unreliable. Defendant received all the procedural protection that the Constitution required. If defendant was to obtain relief, he had to do so through a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>

When he was confronted, defendant allegedly threatened to kill the victim. He was convicted of second degree assault and third degree theft. Thereafter, defendant sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the State was not required to allege in the indictment that defendant committed theft not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars in value. Although value was stated in Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9A.56.050, it was not an essential element of a crime unless it represented a minimum threshold value that the State was required to prove. Next, there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions. As to the assault charge under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.021, the jury was instructed that the crime could have been committed in three ways: by a battery, an attempted battery, or intentional infliction of imminent fear of bodily injury. The undisputed evidence showed that defendant raised a bowling pin over the victim in a threatening manner. Finally, the evidence showed that defendant wrongfully obtained the property from the victim because he did not have permission to enter his home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several witnesses told police that defendant was in possession of a gun. He was charged with a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(1)(a) due to a previous conviction for residential burglary. However, defendant contended that he was not told of his firearm possession rights. After the trial court imposed a manifest injustice disposition, defendant sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that there was a failure to comply with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.047 when the original trial court did not check the box on the judgment and sentence indicating that defendant was prohibited from possessing a firearm. But defendant did not show that he looked at or relied on the judgment and sentence to determine whether he could possess a firearm. Further, the original trial court did not give any misleading affirmative information. Next, the sentence imposed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.160(2) was justified due to defendant's extensive prior criminal history and his failure to comply with prior dispositions and paroles; moreover, it was not excessive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of fourth degree assault (domestic violence) for pushing a family member. The trial court sentenced defendant to 365 days with 330 days suspended for two years on good behavior, and defense counsel did not object to the length of the sentence. A second lawyer informed defense counsel of the implications of such a sentence in an assault case, that a sentence of 365 days prompted federal immigration authorities to begin deportation proceedings, while a sentence of even one day less, 364 days, did not. Defense counsel moved to modify the sentence to 364 days to avoid deportation, and the trial court readily agreed that the amendment was appropriate. The appellate court ruled that defense counsel's failure to inform the trial court of defendant's alien status was excusable neglect under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8. The trial court reconsidered its sentence one day after its entry, and armed with information supplied by more experienced counsel ordered an amendment to the sentence that had minimal practical impact on the State but had critical consequences to defendant. The trial court properly exercised its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington, granted summary judgment in favor of respondent city by deciding that the city fire code authorized the city fire chief to require appellant mobile home park owner to install fire hydrants. The trial court granted the city attorney fees but denied a motion by the city for Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 11 sanctions against the owner. The owner appealed; the city cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that he did not have to install fire hydrants in the mobile home park. The appellate court noted that a mobile home was a building for the purposes of the fire code. And homes were constructed or moved into or within the park after 1989, when the Uniform Fire Code for all counties and cities was adopted by the State, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.27.031. Some homes were more than 150 feet from a public street water main. The pertinent portions of the city's fire code were calculated to protect life and limb. Even if Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.84.370 did not preclude administrative boards from awarding fees, no authority existed for the Fire Code Board of Appeals to award fees. The Uniform Fire Code &sect; 103.1.4 said nothing about awarding attorney fees to the prevailing party. The trial judge did not abuse its discretion in determining that Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 11 was not violated where the argument was not frivolous, was offered in good faith, and was properly before the court. The appellate court denied the city's motion to strike the appendix from the owner's brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to the second order of correction and to the denial of sanctions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed by police as leaving a convenience store without paying for gas. Defendant was arrested for theft, and a search incident to arrest revealed a baggie containing a white substance in his truck. The substance tested positive for methamphetamine. On appeal, defendant argued that he was denied his constitutional right to confrontation, the prosecutor committed misconduct, and his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The appellate court ruled that the trial court properly admitted the convenience store clerk's testimony regarding her fellow cashier's statement, as the statement was not testimonial in nature and the confrontation clause did not apply. Also, defendant failed to show prosecutorial misconduct, as he could not show a substantial likelihood that the disputed line of questioning affected the verdict. Furthermore, defendant's sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant failed to address the factors in his arguments on appeal, and in the absence of an argument specifically addressing the relevant factors, it could not be said that defendant's sentence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that Wash. Rev.

The trial court found that the legislature amended the statute to establish new potential pension benefits that did not significantly increase DRS's administrative costs. The appellate court agreed with the superior court that in amending the statute to create pension benefits for occupational diseases, the legislature could have intended to create a convenient means for DRS to determine coverage without the necessity of making costly individual eligibility determinations. The statute was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest in creating new benefits that did not create significant administrative costs.  Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city fire fighter trainee was injured during a training exercise. The trainee, a law enforcement officer and fire fighter retirement system (LEOFF) member, sued appellee city for negligence pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.281. A jury in the Superior Court for King County (Washington) found the city negligent and returned a verdict in the trainee's favor of $1,513,663, after a remittitur. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city challenged the basis for the trainee's suit on constitutional and statutory grounds and assigned error to numerous trial court rulings. The appellate court first addressed the city's claim that it was entitled to sovereign immunity from its LEOFF-member employees' tort claims. The city relied on Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96.010(1). Although the statute generally waived a municipality's sovereign immunity, the city contended that the phrase, &quot;to the same extent as if they were a private person or corporation,&quot; operated to provide the city with sovereign immunity from claims under LEOFF because a private person or corporation was not required to pay into a worker's compensation fund and still be subject to an employee's tort suit.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.281 placed a statutory duty on municipal corporations not to injure employee fire fighters or police officers by negligent acts or omissions. That satisfied the public duty doctrine and established a cause of action that was in turn permitted by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96.010. The city's sovereign immunity from claims brought under the LEOFF statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.281, was waived by Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;4.96.010.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Washington trial court set aside an attorney lien appellant attorney filed against the real property respondent client was awarded in a marital dissolution proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client moved the court to dismiss the appeal because the attorney filed it as a notice of appeal instead of as a notice for discretionary review. The appellate court found that the attorney's appeal was proper as the order from which the attorney appealed was effectively a final order as to his attorney lien. The attorney claimed that because he filed his attorney lien before judgment, he had rights to funds held by both his client and the client's ex-wife and any proceeds from the sale of marital assets to third parties. The appellate court noted that the attorney did not have any claim on funds in the ex-wife's hands unless they were funds she had to pay his client in judgment. The attorney had priority in any monetary judgment the client received; however, because the client's judgment awarded him real property, the attorney may not claim a lien on it. An attorney had no lien if the recovery his client obtained was real property. This interpretation was not an unconstitutional application of the lien statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 60.40.010. Because the decision was affirmed in the client's favor, he was the prevailing party and was entitled to attorney fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Appellants had appealed the board's decision under the Washington Land Use Petition Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.70C.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subject property was large, undeveloped, and surrounded by other similar properties with identical zoning designations to the east, west, and south. The board determined that rezoning the property, an undeveloped rural parcel, would contravene its comprehensive plan (CP), development regulations (DRs), and the goals of the Growth Management Act (GMA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 36.70A.010-.902. The court first determined that appellants waived their right to argue that the county did not comply with the GMA's notice and public participation procedures. Appellants should have first presented that argument to the Western Washington Growth Management Hearings Board, not the court. The court next decided that appellants' takings claim was reviewable, but it determined that appellants' facial challenge to the validity of the county's CP and DRs failed and that its &quot;as applied&quot; challenge was not yet ripe. The court next held that the county's designation of rural areas and densities was not unduly oppressive and thus did not violate substantive due process. Finally, the court found that substantial evidence supported the board's findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company held a mortgage on the decedent's property, and the PUD had a lien on the property due to a loan by the PUD for energy conservation improvements to the home. The decedent died and the company initiated foreclosure proceedings. Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10 authorized the PUD to establish a lien against the structure and entitled the PUD to traditional lien law protections. The court held that Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7 did not mandate repayment. The PUD demonstrated a lack of donated intent because it received the benefit of saved electricity with the improvements. Also, provisions allowing the PUD to establish a lien did not expressly enable it to shut off power to a subsequent owner where the previous owner defaulted on a conservation loan. As a lender, the PUD was required to abide by lien and contract laws applicable to other lenders. Further, when acting as a lender, the PUD was not acting solely as a utility service provider and thus it could not extend benefits the legislature bestowed on it as a utility service provider to itself in the lender role. The PUD had other remedies s a junior lien holder, such as foreclosing at the time of default.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate predicated his appeal upon the Veteran's Administration benefits anti-alienation statute,&nbsp;38 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5301, and rested his argument entirely upon a ruling by a federal district judge in Wright v. Riveland, in which a class of Washington inmates challenged the same statutory deductions on a variety of constitutional bases. He argued that the federal judge's ruling in Wright constituted controlling precedent establishing that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.480(2) conflicted with 38 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5301 and was void to the extent it permitted seizure of federal pension funds. However, the instant court noted that the inmate did not make the argument below. Although the inmate's counsel made one reference to the Wright case at the summary judgment hearing, counsel did not advance the argument. Thus, the argument was not preserved for review. Even if the instant court were inclined to review the argument, it was unable to do so because the inmate provided neither an adequate record nor a legal foundation. Even if the instant court had the district court ruling before it and were persuaded by it, the inmate could not establish that he would be governed by it.</SPAN></P>

The State conceded that the second defendant's convictions for two counts of unlawful display of a weapon violated double jeopardy. The instant court accepted the State's concession of error.

Defendant's children each testified that they entered defendant's bedroom and observed the victim on top of defendant, moving up and down and that defendant had her eyes closed and appeared to be asleep or passed out. The appellate court ruled that the trial court erred by rejecting defendant's proposed jury instruction on her defense to the second degree child rape count. Drawing reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of defendant, a finder of fact could have reached the conclusion the victim had intercourse with defendant without her consent, knowledge, or awareness, and defendant was thus not guilty of rape of a child.

The evidence was sufficient such that a rational trier of fact could find that defendant murdered the victim to advance his position as a white supremacist because: (1) defendant was the member of a white supremacist subgroup; (2) defendant wanted to advance his position in the subgroup and open his own local chapter; (3) acts of violence elevated a member's status in many white supremacist subgroups; (4) defendant and his co-defendants were underneath an interstate looking to &quot;do&quot; someone inferior; (5) the victim was viewed as inferior by defendant and his co-defendants; (6) the victim's murder elevated a co-defendant's status; and (7) defendant wondered aloud whether the victim's murder would elevate his status with God.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditors notified the judgment debtors of the sale and of their right of redemption. They did not, however, provide direct notice to the lienholder, although the sale was properly posted and published. Days before the one-year redemption period expired, the lienholder learned of the sale, but a sheriff's deed was issued and recorded. In response to the creditors' motion for summary judgment, the lienholder raised a challenge to the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 6.21.030(1) and 6.23.030(1), but the court affirmed the trial court's judgment of dismissal. Finding that the statutes were unambiguous and had been fully satisfied, the court next found that the constitutional challenge was never before the trial court because a complaint could not be amended in arguments in a response brief. Noting that the statutory period set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.56.190 had not yet expired, the court next found that a challenge based on lack of court confirmation was not ripe for review. Finally, the court declined to address alleged sale irregularities because the lienholder did not object to the sheriff's return within the 20-day period set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.21.110(2).</SPAN></P>

One month after he was sentenced, defendant moved to withdraw his plea. The court of appeals held, inter alia, that (1) although a form that was given to defendant before he pled guilty did not inform him that he would have to provide a DNA sample if he were convicted, that omission did not affect the validity of his guilty plea; (2) defendant provided no evidence that he was incapacitated at the time he entered his plea because he had taken drugs, and his bear assertion that he was intoxicated was not enough to invalidate his plea (3) defendant's general assertions, unsupported by affidavits, that his counsel failed to provide proper advice and failed to investigate his reasons for wanting to withdraw his plea were insufficient to show that he was denied effective assistance of counsel; and (4) the State's sentencing guidelines were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

It rejected defendant's contention that he was unlawfully seized under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, when the officer requested him and the other passengers to remain in the car. Defendant failed to provide any evidence in the record that his movement or freedom were restrained. However, even if the officer did order defendant to remain in the car, the officer was entitled to do so in order to ensure his safety. The instant court also concluded that the evidence in defendant's backpack was admissible as product of a warrantless search for officer safety.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was diagnosed as HIV positive, then had sexual contact with more than a thousand persons without wearing a condom. When a doctor learned that a third individual diagnosed with AIDS named defendant as a sex partner, defendant was served with a cease and desist order under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 70.24.024. The court affirmed, and held that nothing required the State to exhaust civil measures under ch. 70.24 before enforcing a criminal statute. Defendant's equal protection rights were not violated because the classification under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.011(1)(b) had a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state objective--to stop the transmission of a deadly disease. Further, &sect; 9A.36.011(1)(b) did not grant unconstitutional immunity by not including other sexually transmitted diseases. There was evidence that defendant knew that he was HIV-positive when he engaged in unprotected sexual activities while concealing his HIV status. Thus, there was sufficient evidence that defendant intentionally exposed the victims to the disease. Also, the trial court properly refused to consider a consent defense because defendant did not disclose his HIV status to any of the victims.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision and held that appellant's substantive due process rights were not violated because the &quot;about to be released&quot; language of Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a search warrant, respondent Washington State Liquor Control Board found 30,600 assorted packs of unstamped, untaxed cigarettes in a van driven by the man. The van was owned by the woman. The Board seized the van and cigarettes, and notified appellants that the seized property would be forfeited. Appellants argued that the property was not contraband because the statutory scheme did not apply to the woman, who was a member of an Indian tribe and had an American Indian business license. The court concluded that the woman's Indian status did not prevent the State from imposing an excise tax on her activities off-reservation. It rejected appellants' contention that the excise tax violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The statute authorizing the excise tax, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 82.24, did not openly discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of Washington state interests. Appellants failed to persuade the court that Washington's tax scheme was invalid as applied to Indians generally. Appellants also failed to qualify for an exemption to Washington's excise tax scheme. The seized cigarettes were contraband subject to forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to the Hunt decision, the court held that: (1) whether a defendant was on community placement for another crime when he committed the crime for which he was being sentenced was not an aggravating factor increasing defendant's sentence beyond the standard sentencing range for the current crime; (2) therefore, the additional offender point based on defendant's community placement status did not implicate Blakely or require a factual determination by a jury; and (3) defendant's standard-range sentence did not violate any Blakely principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For purposes of Wash. Rev.

Thus, the state sales tax applied to the vendors' sales of medical products. Although the vendors had standing to seek the sales tax refunds, they were not entitled to such refunds because the vendors were liable to the Department to remit taxes on taxable sales, whether or not they collected from the buyers. Moreover, the transactions at issue were taxable sales. Thus, the vendors were required to remit sales taxes from their own pockets.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the affidavit supporting the search warrant was sufficient in that it did not merely rely on an informant's tip that defendant had pornography in his bags; it explained that pedophiles habitually keep pornography for long periods of time. Further, the information was not stale because it showed a likelihood of continuous presence of child pornography. The trial court properly admitted anime drawings that resembled images found on the landlords' computer. However, the court vacated the consecutive sentences imposed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.589(1)(a) because the &quot;too lenient&quot; conclusion made by the trial court implicated Blakely.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative buyer of the truck did not get what he bargained for. Defendants repeatedly claimed the truck had been driven only 70,000 miles by its only owner and had always been garaged. None of that was true. To induce the sale, defendants falsely described the truck in the significant matter of mileage, if nothing else. The evidence was sufficient to establish the deprivation necessary to prove an unlawful taking. Also, the legislature did not intend an inquiry into the thief's net gain or the victim's net loss once the fact of a deprivation was established. The evidence establishing existence and value of a deprivation would be the same in takings theft cases (and often, in unauthorized control cases as well), but in deception cases, the statute required a different analysis. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.020(1)(b) looked only to the value of the property obtained, not the net result of the exchange. The property defendants attempted to obtain was a valid cashier's check for $ 5,500. Where the property stolen was money, there was no need to determine value. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to establish the value element of attempted theft in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As directed, DOC evaluated the inmate and determined he was eligible to earn early release under Wash. Rev.

Three weeks before his scheduled release, DOC decided the inmate was not eligible for early release under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.728 and changed his release date. Based on its review of the inmate's file, DOC recalculated his score. The inmate contended DOC's decision to review the previous risk assessment was not authorized by Wash. Rev.

The appellate court concluded that DOC's decision to change the LSI-R score making him ineligible for release under &sect; 9.94A.728(1)(b) was not based on the LSI-R risk assessment instrument.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician argued that the commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in excess of its authority and denied him due process when it refused to conduct a hearing, dismissed the charges against him without prejudice, and failed to accord him a public exoneration. The court disagreed, concluding that the commission did not deprive the physician of his constitutional right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to hold a hearing after issuing a press release withdrawing the statement of charges against him. Although professional courtesy may have entitled the physician to a hearing so he could clear his name, due process did not require one. The commission had the statutory authority to withdraw the charges against the physician without a hearing. Because the commission did not decide the case on its merits, the physician was not entitled to dismissal with prejudice. The physician was not entitled to public exoneration under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.130.110 because the commission never reached the point of determining whether the physician engaged in unprofessional conduct. Thus, the public exoneration requirement of &sect; 18.130.110 was never triggered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Superior Court of King County (Washington) found defendant guilty of robbery in the first degree and two counts of assault in the first degree. The trial court ruled the convictions for the robbery and assault of the store owner involved the same criminal conduct, but it ordered standard range sentences for the two separate first-degree assault convictions involving different victims to be served consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a robbery, defendant fired two shots. Two victims, a store owner and a customer, were injured. Defendant admitted he went into the store with the intent to commit robbery. He admitted that he had a loaded gun and he intentionally shot at the owner. There was also no dispute that the owner and the customer were both injured. The owner was shot in the hand and the customer in the cheek. Even if one bullet caused both injuries, there was more than one criminal act. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding defendant's criminal conduct was separate and distinct for purposes of imposing a consecutive sentence for the two first-degree assault convictions under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.589(1)(b). On appeal, defendant also contended that the firearm enhancement for the two first-degree assault convictions violated the state and federal double jeopardy clauses. He argued that he was being punished twice - once for first-degree assault with a firearm and again for being armed with a firearm while committing the same assault. The appellate court rejected defendant's double jeopardy challenge to the imposition of the firearm enhancement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision imposing consecutive sentences was affirmed. However, the appellate court remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing for the robbery conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and alleged that the court erred by imposing a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum and that the third degree rape statute, Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 21 years old and engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim who was 14 years old. The appellate court agreed with defendant that his sentence had to be remanded because the statutory maximum for third degree rape was 60 months. Thus, defendant's sentence of 31 months incarceration and 36 to 48 months community custody exceeded the statutory maximum. The appellate court remanded for resentencing. The appellate court rejected defendant's claim that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;9A.44.079 was unconstitutional because consent was not allowed as a defense because the instant court, in applying the minimum scrutiny test, concluded that the classifications in &sect; 9A.44.079 drew a rational distinction between older, potentially predatory persons and younger, less mature persons in the victim's age group. More importantly, the court also concluded that the distinction between the classifications was not wholly unrelated to the legitimate interest of protecting children from sexually predatory adults. Finally, the court held that the child rape statutes advanced the State's legitimate interest in protecting children who were too immature to consent.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted the ordinance under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 89.08.400 as a conservation &quot;special assessment.&quot; The taxpayer argued that the appeal period for actions to recover any tax levied or assessed was the analogous appeal period. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 84.68.060, actions to recover any tax levied or assessed could be commenced until after the 30th day of the next succeeding June following the year in which the tax became payable. The taxpayer claimed that the instant tax was not payable until 2003; thus, he had until June 30, 2004, to bring his complaint. He filed his complaint for declaratory judgment on March 10, 2003. His complaint was clear; he argued that the ordinance was an invalid tax, not a special assessment or a local improvement. The action was more analogous to one seeking to recover a tax than to one challenging municipal local improvements, thus, the appellate court held that &sect;&nbsp;84.68.060 was the analogous appeal period. Under that rule, the appellate court held that the taxpayer's complaint was timely and the trial court had erred in ruling that the action was barred by analogy to the 30-day period that limited other actions against the county.</SPAN></P>

The prospective jurors had little awareness of the publicity and the details of the crime. Given the scrupulous care taken by the trial court, the circumstances did not show a probability of unfair prejudice. The court further held that upon arrest, defendant was properly advised of his right to counsel under U.S. Const. amends. V and VI before he gave an incriminating statement. The trial court did not err in admitting an out of court statement by a coconspirator and defendant failed to preserve his claim that the &quot;major participant&quot; language in the aggravating factor instructions needed further definition. Although photographs were gruesome and disturbing, a reasonable person could have concluded that jurors would better understand the doctor's testimony with photographs than they would have with diagrams. The court concluded that defendant had a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A deputy stopped defendant's vehicle because he was not wearing a seat belt. Defendant identified himself with a &quot;punched&quot; driver's license. A records search confirmed defendant's driver's license was suspended in the third degree. The deputy arrested defendant for third degree driving with a suspended license and searched his vehicle incident to arrest. During the search, the deputy found two baggies of marijuana and a digital scale. The deputy then arrested defendant for possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver. Defendant admitted he bought the marijuana and stated he intended to sell it due to financial difficulties. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and the denial of motion to suppress. The appellate court noted that in order for defendant to take advantage of the rule of law in City of Richmond v. Moore that held that two means of suspending a license were unconstitutional, defendant had to show that his license suspension fell under the unconstitutional statute and not one of constitutional reasons in Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;46.20.342(1)(c). As the record did not show why defendant's license was suspended, he was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington) convicting him of unlawful methamphetamine possession and first-degree escape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was searched after the vehicle he was riding in was pulled over for having a defective muffler. A computer check indicated that a warrant had been issued for his arrest for failing to return to jail from a work release program. Methamphetamine was found both in his pocket and his backpack. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress the methamphetamine because the request for information amounted to an illegal seizure that violated defendant's constitutional rights to privacy under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and the fact that defendant provided false identification information to the officer could not create an articulable suspicion justifying the further investigation and arrest. Because the officer unlawfully seized defendant before conducting a vehicle search, the methamphetamine should have been suppressed. However, because the State did not rely on any excludable evidence to convict defendant of escape, as the outstanding arrest warrant was valid and existed independently of the illegal seizure, the trial court's error in denying defendant's suppression motion did not require reversal of the escape conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for unlawful methamphetamine conviction was reversed, but his first-degree escape conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant surviving spouse moved for reconsideration of the reversal of a prejudgment attachment she obtained against a judgment debtor in her wrongful death action. The Superior Court of Clark County, Washington, denied the spouse's motion and granted the motion to vacate the writ brought by respondent, the buyer of the judgment debtor's property, setting aside the sale and quieting title in the property to the buyer. The spouse sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the spouse challenged the trial court's action quieting title to the property at issue to the buyer. The appellate court found that the spouse did not formally file any post-judgment motion, such as a motion for new trial or relief from judgment. Instead, she simply asked the trial court to refuse to enter the order enforcing the mandate in order to preserve the status quo, suggesting that the parties might develop further facts for a future trial. Further, the issue the spouse raised--the effect, if any, of the adversarial hearing after issuance of the ex parte prejudgment writ--was one the appellate court already had considered in a prior appeal. The spouse made the same arguments she was raising in the instant appeal during the earlier appeal, and the appellate court agreed with the buyer that this particular hearing could not cure the constitutional violation. Thus, the issue the spouse raised in the trial court was one already decided by the appellate court under Wash. R. App. P. 12.2, which barred the spouse's attempt to appeal the order enforcing the clear mandate of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants were convicted of second degree felony murder with drive-by shooting/reckless endangerment as the predicate underlying offense. Defendants were convicted in 1997 and 1998. In 2002, the state supreme court held that second degree assault could not be a predicate crime for second degree felony murder. Defendants argued that the instant court should apply the reasoning of In the Personal Restraint Petition of Andress and hold that drive-by shooting/reckless endangerment also could not be a predicate offense for second degree felony murder. Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;10.73.090(1), the personal restraint petition could not filed more than a year after the judgment became final unless there was a significant change in the law that was material to their convictions. The appellate court held the petitions were time-barred because they were not filed within a year of the judgments becoming final and Andress did not represent a significant change in the law material to their convictions as it only applied where assault was the predicate offense for second degree felony murder.</SPAN></P>

The judgment and sentence was filed on January 26, 2004, and defendant did not seek further review. Defendant sought to withdraw his guilty plea after Blakely v. Washington was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court and claimed that his sentence was unconstitutional because it was based on facts neither charged in the information nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion because the state supreme court held that Blakely was not to be applied retroactively. Also, in imposing the exceptional sentence in this case, the sentencing court expressly relied on former Wash. Rev.

Rev. Code &sect; 82.24.130.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wholesaler claimed the cigarette tax was unconstitutional as applied to him as an Indian and that he was exempt under state law. On appeal, the court found that the wholesaler possessed, transported and intended to sell unstamped cigarettes and that no exemption applied; therefore, the contested cigarettes were contraband under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.24.130, and the seized cigarettes, truck, and trailer were subject to forfeiture under &sect; 82.24.130(1)(a), (b). The court rejected the wholesaler's claim that the cigarette tax violated the Commerce Clause because Chapter 82.24 applied evenly to in-state and out-of-state transactions. Also Chapter 82.24 did not unduly burden or discriminate against Indian commerce because the incidence of the tax was on non-Indian or non-tribal Indian consumers. The court found that the wholesaler was not exempt from tax under state law because he was not a Washington licensed wholesaler or a certified out-of-state wholesaler, and his Indian status did not prevent the State from imposing an excise tax on his activities off-reservation. The wholesaler failed to show he was conducting business under tribal license or approval or in Indian country.</SPAN></P>

The company did not have a permit and claimed that it was not required to obtain an SMA permit. The court held that the company engaged in development under Pierce County, Wash., Code &sect; 20.76.030 when it harvested and planted geoducks on the leased properties because the activities prevented the general public from using certain areas of the water. Also, because the company engaged in shoreline development worth more than $2500 when it harvested and planted geoducks, this constituted a substantial development under &sect; 20.76.030. The court also held that &sect; 20.24.030(A) was not ambiguous, and did not exempt commercial geoduck harvesting from the need for a shoreline substantial development permit. The provision clearly subjected geoduck harvesting to one overall qualifier--substantial development permit review under Pierce County, Wash., Code &sect; 20.24.020. Further, the county properly ordered the company to cease working in eelgrass beds on the property where the hearing examiner found that the company was working without the necessary authorization.</SPAN></P>

Defendant received a standard range sentence for third degree assault and a 12-month suspended sentence for malicious mischief in the third degree. Without notice to defense counsel, the trial court later ordered him to pay restitution. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, defendant's girlfriend, called 911 from her home. Audibly distressed and crying, she told the operator that defendant, her boyfriend, had just punched her, grabbed her by her throat, and broken her cell phone by throwing it against a wall. She complained of neck pain and accepted the operator's offer of medical aid. The appellate court found that a rational trier of fact could conclude that defendant caused the victim substantial pain and considerable suffering because there was evidence that she complained of neck pain lasting for more than three hours, and that she had swelling on her cheek and an abrasion on her forehead, all of which was consistent with her claim that defendant threw her against a wall and choked her. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction for third degree assault, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.031(1)(f). But, the trial court exceeded its authority when it imposed a 12-month suspended sentence for the malicious mischief charge, which carried a maximum sentence of 90 days in jail. Also, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.753(1), because no notice of the hearing was given to defendant, the restitution order entered was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction, vacated his malicious mischief sentence and remanded for resentencing, and vacated the order of restitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had two children together. They separated in 2003, and the matter came to trial in March 2004. The husband represented himself, as he did on appeal. The trial court rejected the husband's allegations that the wife abused the children, found a repeated pattern of domestic violence required limitations on the husband's residential time with the children, imputed income to the husband based upon his choice to pursue a doctorate in education rather than seek continued employment in business based upon his MBA degree, and extended the protection order for five years. The only argument the appellate court could consider on appeal due to the husband's failure to properly brief the court and prepare the record was whether the trial court erred by denying the husband the right to question a domestic violence treatment provider. However, the appellate court held the trial court did not err as the husband failed to lay the foundation the witness was qualified to answer a question regarding what arrangement was in the best interest of the children. The mother was awarded her attorney fees on appeal subject to her compliance with Wash. R. App. P. 18.1(d).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in admitting a deputy's testimony about statements made to him by the victim, and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.

Contrary to defendant's assertion, his counsel was not ineffective by failing to move to dismiss the second rape charge based on joinder principles as the two charges were not based on the same crime. Nor was counsel ineffective for failing to request an instruction telling the jury defendant was not compelled to testify as requesting such an instruction was a tactical decision. And as the conduct that formed the basis of defendant's conviction was clearly prohibited and specifically charged, Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the parties were divorced, respondent mother was awarded primary custody of their child. Later, appellant father successfully moved for a change of placement for the child and was awarded primary custody. One year later, he gave notice that he intended to move the child out of state, and the mother objected. The Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington, denied the father's request for relocation. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the father contended the relocation statutes,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 26.09.260(6), .480, .520, were unconstitutional because they violated a fit custodial parent's fundamental right to autonomy in child-rearing decisions. The appellate court disagreed, finding first that the relocation statutes did not prevent the father from relocating; the trial court's order prevented the child from relocating. Further, the trial court considered each of the factors under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.520 in making its decision, and the father did not challenge any of the trial court's findings. When considering the child's relationship with her mother, the trial court found that this relationship was equal to, if not better than, the child's relationship with the father, the child was at an age where her mother was very important to her, the mother was the parent that the child confided in, and the father's new location was not conducive to a continued relationship between the child and her mother. Isolating the child in the father's new location from currently available activities was not a positive factor, and the father's request for relocation was not an exercise in good faith.</SPAN></P>

During these searches, the police found evidence of the possession and manufacture of methamphetamine. The police also found firearms in the trailer. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction the evidence obtained following the search incident to the arrest was not obtained unlawfully as the police had probable cause to stop defendant. The evidence was sufficient to find defendant was in unlawful possession of pseudoephedrine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine because a forensic scientist testified that the labels on the boxes listed pseudoephedrine as one of the drugs contained in the Sudafed, leading to the reasonable inference that the boxes contained pseudoephedrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspaper requested records of an investigation and settlement by appellee school district following the wrongful death of a young student. The district moved for a declaration that the records were exempt from disclosure. The Superior Court for Spokane County (Washington) held that the documents were &quot;classic&quot; attorney work product and exempt from disclosure under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.310(1)(j). The newspaper appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student died from anaphylactic shock after being fed peanut-laden food on a school outing. The superintendent was informed of the unfolding tragedy by telephone and immediately called the district's private law firm. Counsel advised that a wrongful death action was a near certainty and then took over all aspects of the district's response and hired a private investigator to gather facts and interview witnesses. The lawyers prepared all documents and quickly negotiated a settlement between the district and the child's parents. The settlement agreement was released. The documents requested were all generated by the district's attorneys and their investigators in preparation for the anticipated wrongful death claim, which quickly followed the child's death. The court's finding that the documents were prepared in anticipation of litigation was easily supported by the record based on the nature of the incident, counsel's advice to the district, and the fact that a claim was in fact filed within days. The documents were memoranda of witnesses' oral statements to the investigator and notes by the district's lawyers of their own pretrial preparations and were &quot;classic&quot; work product.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision by the Clark County Superior Court, Washington, suppressing evidence, which resulted in dismissal of the charge that defendant possessed marijuana with intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant for driving with expired license tags. She told him that her license was suspended, and he arrested her. When he searched defendant's car incident to the arrest, he discovered a brown paper bag containing a $ 20 bill and four baggies of marijuana. Defendant admitted that the marijuana belonged to her and that she had already sold one baggie of it. The State charged her with possession of marijuana with intent to deliver and third degree driving while license suspended (DWLS). Relying on City of Redmond v. Moore, defendant moved to suppress the drug evidence because Moore had held that license suspensions pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.289 and .342(1) were unconstitutional because they did not provide for a hearing prior to suspension of a driver's license and could not justify convictions of DWLS. Thus, the trial court granted the motion to suppress because it was the result of an arrest following an invalid suspension. The appellate court reversed and held that as the officer knew defendant's license was suspended, and had no reason to believe the suspension was invalid, his arrest and the subsequent search of the car was lawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suppression order and the order dismissing the drug charge were reversed, and the case was remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of first degree assault under an accomplice liability instruction, and this conviction was affirmed on appeal. Thereafter, he filed a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The trial court denied the motion, and the inmate appealed. He also filed a PRP, arguing that the evidence at trial was insufficient to show accomplice liability. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the inmate failed to show that the information in some of the affidavits could not have been discovered at trial or within 10 days of the trial since two persons giving the affidavits were among the original defendants in the assault case. Next, there was no evidence to support the reliability of the affidavit of another witness. An alleged recantation was submitted seven years after the original trial and absent the procedures and protections of trial court. No evidentiary hearing on the issue was required. Since there was no newly discovered evidence, the motion was time barred under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090(1). Moreover, the PRP was untimely under this section as well, and it presented no evidence that had not already been considered on direct review.</SPAN></P>

Thus, his right to a speedy trial was not violated.

The court did however remand to the trial court to review the Utah federal court record to determine what prior felony conviction the Utah court used as the predicate offense to convict defendant of unlawful firearm possession; to make appropriate comparability determinations; to recalculate defendant's offender score; and to resentence defendant if necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county enacted a zoning code in 1982, and amended its zoning code in December 1995. The county sued the owner in 2002 to remove certain signage on his property, to enjoin him from operating an RV park and campground, and to enjoin him from using his broken septic system without a septic permit. The appellate court determined that the issue before it was whether the RV park and campground did not grandfather in under the 1995 zoning amendments. The appellate court ruled that substantial evidence supported the trial court's finding. Substantial evidence indicated that the RV park and campground did not exist until well after 1995. A neighbor testified that the RV park and campground did not exist prior to 2000 or 2001. The owner was unable to present any business records for the rental activity prior to 2001, and there was a lack of any reference to the RV park and campground in submitted business documents and the owner's 1998 letter to the water district. The owner's testimony was the only evidence in the record indicating that the RV park and campground were operating prior to 1995.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions by the Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington of taking a motor vehicle without permission and first degree burglary under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.020(1)(b). The State cross-appealed alleging the trial court erred in calculating defendant's offender score in washing out certain juvenile class C felony offenses by failing to consider an intervening misdemeanor conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was drinking with his girlfriend and the car owner. When the owner parked the car, defendant pushed her out and drove away. He crashed and left the scene. Soon thereafter, defendant broke into a home. The court held that the State did not comment on the evidence by pointing out defendant's flippant and evasive exchanges with the officers as defendant never quit talking after he was arrested. Also, because intent had to be shown in the burglary charge, defendant opened the door for asking defendant's expert's questions regarding defendant's &quot;silence&quot; by the expert testifying that defendant's capacity was diminished. Also, neither term of the burglary victim and car owner no-contact order exceeded the maximum sentence for convictions. The court concluded that prior juvenile adjudications may be considered by the trial court in setting a sentencing range without being proved to a jury. Finally, the State did not provide any evidence to the trial court to support its &quot;representations&quot; of the 1994 conviction in the face of defendant's specific objection to the use of this conviction in the calculation of his offender score.</SPAN></P>

The officer discovered defendant's driving privileges had been suspended in the third degree and arrested him. In a search incident to the arrest, the officer found a baggie of white powder that tested positive for methamphetamine. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the statute upon which his arrest was based, third degree driving with license suspended, had been declared unconstitutional in another case. The instant court noted that defendant was entitled to relief only if his license was suspended pursuant to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.289 (2002) and former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.324(1) (1965), the statutes that had been declared unconstitutional.

The trial court held that the examiner could properly reject the permit based on the Thurston County Code even though the provider met the specific wireless communications facility (WCF) requirements. The court affirmed, and held that because the comprehensive plan was not inconsistent with the specific zoning code, the county properly required a proposed WCF to satisfy both the comprehensive plan, under Thurston County, Wash., Code 20.54, and the specific standards in Thurston County, Wash., Code 20.33. The examiner based his decision that the proposed WCF was contrary to the plan's utilities' policy on finding that the WCF failed to meet the general standard contained in the special use code provision. The general standards of Thurston County, Wash., Code 20.54.040 applied independently of, and parallel with, the specific standards of Thurston County, Wash., Code 20.33.

The petition was filed by respondent Washington State Department of Social and Health Services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were declared dependent after it was reported that the mother and children were living in a filthy hotel room. Throughout the dependency proceedings, appellants were not able to maintain housing for any period of time. The court held that although the caseworker appeared to have undermined the parents' trust in the dependency system, substantial evidence supported the trial court's findings inasmuch as the Department fulfilled its obligation to provide information about how to obtain housing. Appellants separated and lost their apartment within six months. The court held that appellants were not prejudiced by any alleged failure to maximize parent-child contact. Evidence supported the finding that there was little likelihood that conditions would be remedied so that the children could be returned to appellants in the near future and that termination was in the girls' best interests. However, because both appellants claimed that their parents were enrolled members of Native-American tribes, the court remanded because it was unclear from the record whether the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) applied to the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed as to the trial court's findings regarding the statutory requirements for termination. The court reversed and remanded for a determination of whether the ICWA applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was serving a 27-month sentence for a second degree assault. As a result of his misbehavior while in state prison, defendant lost all of his potential early release time for time served at the Washington Department of Corrections (DOC) facilities. But defendant had 38 days of earned early release time from time he spent in county jail awaiting his trial and sentencing. The DOC did not take away the county jail time because it believed it did not have the authority to do so. The appellate court determined that to convict defendant of persistent prison misbehavior the State had to prove that he lost all earned early release time that he could potentially have earned in the state correctional facility. The appellate court ruled that there was adequate evidence in the record to support this conclusion, and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94.070 was properly applied to defendant.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.728 required the State to prove that defendant had lost all time within the state system, not the county jail. The persistent prison misbehavior statute applied only to state correctional facilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Master Planned Committee (MPC) was being developed within the City of DuPont. The current boundaries placed almost all of the commercial property in District 400 and almost all of the residential property in District 1. District 1 sought a transfer of territory from District 400 because the city had issued a mandate to have all of its students within its limits attend school in the same district. The appellate court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of District 1 as, inter alia, (1) the proposed transfer, even if it did decrease funding to District 400, did not violate Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington) that convicted him of one count of second-degree burglary and one count of attempted second-degree burglary under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.030(1). Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, and raised claims of error regarding the jury instructions given; the ineffectiveness of his counsel, and improper prosecutorial remarks during closing arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions. The court held that defendant's conviction for burglary was supported by sufficient evidence that included the store owner's photographs of defendant in the store with the broken door and hopping over the counter and searching behind it. Also when defendant was arrested the next night in front of a deli-mart with a broken window, he had items that matched the items taken from the store and was wearing a jacket that matched the person's jacket in the photographs. Also there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction for attempted burglary of the deli-mart where he was acting suspiciously and hiding from police. The court rejected defendant's claims of error as to the permissible inference jury instruction and his claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object because even though the instruction regarding the inference of intent was improper for an attempted burglary charge, defendant was also charged with burglary; thus the instruction was warranted. The court held that any improper prosecutorial remarks were harmless where defendant failed to show prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that defendant failed to show that his license was suspended under the procedural statutes declared unconstitutional, which were former Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.20.289 (2002) and 46.20.324(1) (1965).

The officer asked him to step out of the car. The officer then searched the car incident to the driver's arrest. He found a black leather case under defendant's passenger seat. It contained methamphetamine. The officer arrested defendant. Defendant claimed that as former Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.20.289 and .324(1), the procedural statutes for suspending a license, had been ruled unconstitutional, the officer had no authority to arrest the driver for a suspended license. The appellate court noted that the crime of driving while license suspended under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;46.20.342(1)(c) was not unconstitutional. As an arresting officer did not have to know if an individual's license had been unconstitutionally suspended before arresting an individual for driving with a suspended license, the arrest of the driver was valid and so was the search incident to the arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a previous conviction for driving while license suspended in the second degree. The Department of Licensing automatically suspended his license following this conviction. The Department did not provide defendant a hearing before it suspended his license.

Defendant's car was searched, and the police found drugs and paraphernalia. The appellate court affirmed the suspension of defendant's license, the search of his car, and his convictions. As defendant had a prior conviction for driving while his license was suspended in the second degree, his license was automatically suspended as a result of the conviction under Wash. Rev.

As an administrative hearing was not a constitutional prerequisite to the automatic suspension of a license due to a criminal conviction under Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Mason County (Washington) denied defendant's motion to suppress.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer responded to a call from a store employee who was reporting several uncooperative shoplifters. The employee informed the officer that defendant drove a vehicle involved in the shoplifting. The officer contacted police dispatch and learned that, according to the Washington Department of Licensing records, defendant's driving status was suspended in the third degree. He arrested defendant, placed her in the backseat of his squad car, and then searched her car. On the driver's floorboard, the officer found a black nylon duffel bag that contained, inter alia, two metal cups. Residue from one of the metal cups tested positive for methamphetamine. The statute under which defendant was stopped, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.342(1)(c), was not held to be grossly or flagrantly unconstitutional. Also, there was probable cause for the arrest because the police responded to a call indicating that defendant was involved in shoplifting. Thus, the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence seized as a result of the officer's search. Because the search of her car was lawful, it could not be argued that her counsel was incompetent in resisting the admission of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cocaine was found in a search incident to defendant's arrest for driving with a suspended license. On appeal, he argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the statute upon which his arrest was based, third-degree driving with license suspended, was declared unconstitutional. In a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, he contended that the State failed to prove that the substance he possessed was cocaine. The appellate court noted that because the record was silent as to the means by which defendant's license was suspended or the grounds for the suspension, he had not met his burden of showing that his argument bore relevance to the record or that his license was suspended under a statute that was declared unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the State had to prove the nature of the controlled substance as an essential element of the crime of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. The appellate court concluded that defendant's admission that he possessed cocaine together with the positive field test was sufficient to support his conviction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On two separate occasions, defendant was stopped by police for traffic infractions; on each occasion, she was arrested when police discovered she was driving with a suspended license. On each occasion, police discovered methamphetamine among her possessions in the vehicle in the search incident to arrest. The Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington, convicted defendant on two counts of possession of methamphetamine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that the evidence obtained from the search of her vehicle was inadmissible because the statute upon which her arrest was based was declared unconstitutional in City of Redmond v. Moore; the trial court erred when it ordered that as a condition of her community placement she refrain from associating with known drug offenders; and the trial court erred when it determined, for sentencing purposes under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.285(4), that a vehicle was used in the commission of a felony. The appellate court ruled that it could not review defendant's claim regarding the unconstitutional statute as she failed to show that Moore was relevant. Further, the restriction imposed as a condition of defendant's community placement was not unreasonable as associating with known drug offenders was conduct intrinsic to possession of methamphetamine and was directly related to the circumstances of the crime. However, the appellate court agreed with defendant that the drugs found in her purse did not have a reasonable relation to the operation of the vehicle and the use of the vehicle did not contribute in some reasonable degree to the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed, but the finding that defendant used a motor vehicle in the commission of her crimes was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington), which convicted them of first-degree animal cruelty in violation of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions, but the court affirmed, stating that it was difficult to imagine that any dog, especially one who had followed the two defendants around for almost two weeks, would not unduly suffer with a killing scheme involving shooting the dog with an arrow. The means showed an intent to cause undue suffering because defendants would not have continued to shoot at the dog if it had died with the first shot. Furthermore, pulling the arrows out of a living dog to shoot it repeatedly aggravated the suffering. It was within defendants' ability to understand that those repeated actions intentionally inflicted suffering in the course of killing the dog. Thus, the trial court could have concluded that defendants possessed the requisite intent. Interpreting the evidence in a manner most favorable to the State, the record clearly established sufficient evidence of defendants' intent to cause undue suffering and their guilt under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 16.52.205(1). Further, it was not error for the trial court to give the second defendant up to 24 months to complete the animal cruelty prevention program and his community service hours under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 16.52.200.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent elected to receive a reduced monthly retirement allowance so she could provide a survivor benefit to a designated beneficiary. The decedent's designated beneficiary was her niece, the claimant. Substitute House Bill (SHB) 2604 authorized certain retired members of the state pension system to delete what had previously been an irrevocable survivor benefit in exchange for increased monthly benefits. The decedent deleted her designation of a survivor benefit in favor of the claimant. The decedent's request was made effective with her June 2000 benefit, and the decedent died in May 2001. The claimant maintained that SHB 2604 deprived her of a vested right in the decedent's survivor benefit. The appellate court ruled that the claimant had no vested right in the decedent's pension because her &quot;right&quot; derived from nothing more than an expectation in the continuation of a law that made the survivor designation irrevocable. Also, since the State did not deprive the claimant of any potential vested right, the claimant's due process claim failed. The decedent, not the State, exercised the option to revoke the nonspousal survivor benefit.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that defendant's stipulation to not contest the stop and/or search was a knowing, intelligent waiver of all factual, procedural, or legal issues he might try to assert if his participation in drug court was terminated. Thus, defendant waived his right to contest the search that produced the methamphetamine. Defendant did not show that his license was suspended under the specific unconstitutional provision. Defendant had affirmatively agreed to his offender score and standard range sentence. The agreement represented a failure to identify a factual dispute for the court's resolution and a failure to request an exercise of the court's discretion, which waived the challenge to his offender score. No record supported defendant's contention he served more than 88 days prior to sentence. The remaining alleged facts by defendant were based on evidence outside the appellate court's record.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Franklin County, Washington, found that the citizens lacked standing. The citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the citizens had standing to challenge illegal governmental acts related to the letting and managing of the contracts without pleading a special injury or violation of a unique right to challenge illegal acts. The citizens lacked standing to challenge the cities' discretionary acts unless they could demonstrate a special injury, and none of the citizens owned an animal that was impounded or mistreated. The citizens had taxpayer standing to challenge the bidding procedures and the trial court erred by dismissing the public contract bidding claim. The citizens lacked third party beneficiary standing because the animal control authority did not assume a direct obligations to them when the it made a contract with the cities. Sufficient facts were alleged with regard to two of the citizens' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. Because some of the claims should not have been dismissed, and the citizens had standing to pursue these claims, the trial court erred by dismissing the citizens' requests for injunctive and declaratory relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed orders of the Superior Court of Snohomish County, Washington suppressing evidence in two cases based on the trial court's reasoning that the arrests of defendants for driving with suspended licenses (DWLS 3), Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.20.342, 46.20.289, were unconstitutional because the underlying suspensions were based on statutes held to be unconstitutional in the Moore decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one was arrested for failure to appear on a charge of DWLS 3, and methamphetamine was recovered. Defendant two was arrested for DWLS 3, and methamphetamine and an unlawful firearm were recovered. The court reversed and held that the Moore decision did not address the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.342. Instead, in the course of defending their criminal charges for driving while license suspended, the Moore defendants challenged the constitutionality of the statutes leading to the license suspension underlying the criminal charges. Because defendant one's identification information revealed that his driving status was suspended in the third degree, the deputy had probable cause to arrest defendant one for driving with a suspended license. Because the criminal statute at issue has not been held to be unconstitutional, and because the arrests here were based on a valid warrant and probable cause, the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence discovered in the searches incident to the arrests. Other appellate divisions had concluded that Moore did not affect the validity of other defendants' arrests for DWLS 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual had received a notice about letting his dogs run loose in the neighborhood, but his housekeeper allowed his dogs to go outside, and the dog picked up a cat. While most of the cat's injuries were likely to have been caused by a car accident, the cat also had puncture wounds that were consistent with being bit. The cat was euthanized. As a result of the cat's injuries, Animal Control issued a removal notice to the individual indicating that his offending dog had to be removed from the county or euthanized. The individual appealed the ruling to the Board and sought to subpoena and/or depose witnesses and requested production of veterinary documents regarding the cat and the cat's body for evaluation, but the Board denied the requests. Also, the Board acted in an appellate capacity to determine if Animal Control's order was arbitrary or capricious. The appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court as (1) the individual was denied due process rights by not being allowed to conduct discovery, (2) the improper standard of proof violated the individual's due process rights, and (3) the individual was not given proper notice that his dog was considered vicious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Kitsap County (Washington) that convicted him of unlawful storage of ammonia in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.55.020 and denied his pre-trial motion to dismiss the charges based on defendant's claim that &sect; 69.55.020 was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to his case. The charges stemmed from a citizen's report that methamphetamine was being manufactured on her property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.55.020 was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to provide legal citations to the applicable federal and state regulations pertaining to the storage and handling of ammonia, and the standards were hard to find. The court noted that the Washington Supreme Court had previously rejected this argument and held that a statute that incorporated detailed standards that were difficult to find did not overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality. The court held that &sect; 69.55.020 put the average citizen on notice of the agency regulations controlling the storage of ammonia. The court found that &sect; 69.55.020(1) indicated the relevant federal agency, i.e., the Department of Transportation (DOT), and that &sect; 69.55.020(2) directly identified regulations. Also &sect; 69.55.020 plainly pertained to situations where a person &quot;possessed&quot; pressurized ammonia gas.  The court concluded that because defendant did not set forth facts regarding what steps, if any, he undertook to locate and comply with the applicable federal and state regulations, he failed to show that &sect; 69.55.020 was vague as applied to a reasonable person or himself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Superior Court of Grays Harbor County of second degree trafficking in stolen property under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.82.055(1). The trial court imposed a sentence of two months and ordered him to pay $1,800 in restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted taking an awning structure and selling it for scrap. He said that he had permission from two employees to take scrap from the yard, but could not identify the employees. The court held that whether the material was scarp metal or not, defendant had no right to take the property of another that had value. Therefore, the State provided sufficient evidence that proved all the elements, including recklessness, of second degree trafficking of stolen property. The court also held that &sect; 9A.82.055 was not vague because an ordinary person would understand that one would have to have possession in order to sell something. Thus, a sensible, meaningful, and practical interpretation of the statute left no room for a reasonable person to guess at its meaning or to differ as to its application. Also, the jury instruction regarding a person acting with knowledge was not confusing because the verdict of the lesser crime of second degree trafficking showed that the instructions on knowledge and recklessness actually informed the jury on the correct elements of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which denied his motion for a continuance during his sentencing hearing. He had pled guilty to two counts of rape of a child in the first degree and one count of sexual exploitation of a minor arising from the sexual abuse by way of an Alford plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the trial court's refusal to continue a sentencing hearing for the second time so that he could present an expert's evaluation on his amenability to treatment and eligibility for a Special Sex Offender Sentence Alternative (SSOSA) was an abuse of discretion and a violation of his constitutional right to due process. The court affirmed on appeal however, stating that the trial court assumed that defendant was eligible for a SSOSA and then considered whether the offender and the community would benefit from the imposition of the SSOSA. It was clear from the record that the trial court properly exercised its discretion by basing the denial of a SSOSA on information admitted by the plea agreement or admitted, acknowledged, or proved at trial or sentencing. Contrary to defense counsel's argument, the trial court followed the required procedures contained in former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.110 (2000) (recodified as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.500 by 2001 Wash. Laws ch. 10, &sect; 6). The trial court did not prevent defendant from presenting meaningful arguments by failing to continue the hearing to allow a later introduction of an evaluation involving support for a SSOSA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of first degree rape of a child, one count of second degree rape of a child, one count of third degree rape of a child, and two counts of possession of depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct. The Superior Court, Benton County (Washington) imposed an exceptional sentence of 600 months. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant argued that the information charging him with two counts of possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct omitted the essential statutory element of knowledge. He was charged with two counts of possession of such depictions under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.070 which stated that a person who knowingly possessed visual or printed matter depicting a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct was guilty of a class C felony. The knowledge element required the State to prove defendant was not only aware that the materials were in his or her possession, but also knowledge of the general nature of the materials possessed. Although the caption of the charging document cited to the correct statute,&nbsp;&sect; 9.68A.070, the description of the charges for counts V and VI cited to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68.070 instead. That scrivener's error was not of a magnitude to require reversal on its own. But, as the State failed to provide defendant with the correct statutory citation for the charge of possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, the incorrect statutory reference that the State provided did not give notice to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and sentence for the charges of first, second, and third degree rape of a child were affirmed. The charges of possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct was reversed and dismissed without prejudice to the State's ability to refile and the case was remanded to the trial court for correction of the scrivener's error in the listing of the victim's birth date in the information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her drug conviction, but the court affirmed, stating that the trial court did not err in denying her motion to suppress. Defendant's cited caselaw did not nullify probable cause for her driving while license suspended arrest. Further, the doctrine of invited error precluded her from complaining on appeal about the testimony at issue because she both agreed in advance to the question and answer's propriety and failed to object below that the State deviated from the agreed format. Her counsel was not ineffective because he failed to support her argument as required by Wash. R. App. P. 10.3. The uncontroverted testimony showed that, contrary to defendant's assertion, the officer exercised his discretion to determine whether issuing a citation or arresting defendant was the more appropriate cause of action. Therefore, defense counsel did not render ineffective assistance in failing to argue for suppression of the evidence on that ground. Further, there was nothing inherently suggestive of defendant's guilt in the officer's testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trooper stopped defendant for failing to wear his seat belt and subsequently arrested him on an outstanding warrant for driving with a suspended license (DWLS). Troopers searched his van incident to the DWLS arrest and seized child pornography found in an unlocked briefcase in the van. Following a bench trial on stipulated facts, defendant was convicted of various sexual offenses. On appeal, the court affirmed those offenses, stating that defendant's arrest was supported by a warrant and probable cause based on his admission that his privilege to drive was suspended. After being stopped for failure to wear a seat belt, he told the trooper that his driver's license was suspended. That was confirmed and then defendant was placed under arrest. Probable cause supported defendant's arrest for DWLS. The arrest was valid as was the search incident to it and the fruits of the search were admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In July 2002, defendant and an accomplice trespassed onto the property of the victims.

A neighbor observed the boys lighting pipe bombs in the victims' driveway and throwing unknown objects at the victims' house. As the boys were leaving, they both put dirt on the victims' vehicles in the driveway and damaged one of the driver's side windows of an automobile. Defendant claimed that the July 2002 crimes arose from the &quot;same course of conduct.&quot; The appellate court affirmed the disposition order and held that the prior convictions did not arise from the &quot;same course of conduct&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;13.40.020(7)(a) as the intent was different for malicious mischief than it was for criminal trespass. The appellate court also held that defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by not having a jury determine if the prior convictions arose from the same course of conduct as such finding by a trial court could only lower the applicable sentencing range.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent corporation filed a regulatory takings claim against appellant city, alleging the city terminated its nonconforming use, which in turn denied the corporation its right to lease its land. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the takings issue. The King County Superior Court (Washington) granted the corporation's motion and awarded the corporation the damages it requested as well as attorney fees. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation leased space in its mobile home park, operating it as a legal nonconforming use. The city notified the corporation that it could no longer fill vacant mobile home spaces at the mobile home park because the corporation had never submitted a site plan required by an ordinance (site plan regulation). That prompted the corporation to file the regulatory takings claim. The city did not confer the corporation's private property rights to anyone; thus, this case had to be analyzed as a challenge to the city's exercise of the police power. In this &quot;as applied&quot; challenge, the appellate court was required to balance the State's interest against the regulation's adverse impact on the corporation. The appellate court considered the regulation's impact on the property, the extent the regulation interfered with investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action. Because the site plan regulation was a valid exercise of the city's police power, and the application of the regulation to the mobile home park did not destroy or derogate a fundamental attribute of the corporation's ownership, there was no regulatory taking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was reversed, and the case was remanded for entry of summary judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant possessed a movie which was considered pornographic. He contended he was not afforded due process because he was punished for violating a rule that was unconstitutionally vague. However, he had not shown that the prohibition was unconstitutionally vague. An ordinary person would know, without having to consult a treatment specialist or a community corrections officer, that the restriction on defendant's conduct prohibited possession of the movie. He also contended the restriction of the materials he was allowed to possess or view was an unlawful delegation of powers. The version of the Sentencing Reform Act in effect at the time defendant committed his crimes authorized the sentencing court to order, as a sentence condition, that the offender comply with any crime-related prohibitions, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(8)(c)(v) (1992). Defendant argued the sentencing court improperly delegated its duty to define crime-related prohibitions. This argument was not presented below, but any improper delegation that may have occurred did not amount to a manifest constitutional error warranting appellate review despite the lack of objection below.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.093(1)(b). Defendant, a bus driver, allegedly had a relationship with a high school student.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While evidence indicated that the sexual component did not begin until after the student turned 18, it also showed the romantic relationship began when the student was only 12. Defendant asserted that &sect; 9A.44.093(1)(b) was unconstitutional on its face and as applied in his case. The court held that defendant could not show that &sect; 9A.44.093(1)(b) was facially unconstitutional because he could not show that there was no set of circumstances in which it could be constitutionally applied. Applying a rational basis review, the court held that because the statute was not wholly irrelevant to the goal of preventing the exploitation of students, and therefore not arbitrary, &sect; 9A.44.093(1)(b) did not violate defendant's right to substantive due process. Furthermore, the singling out of school employees had a basis that was rationally related to compelling government purposes. As such, the application of &sect; 9A.44.093(1)(b) to the case did not constitute an equal protection violation. However because the only evidence of substantive guilt was out-of-court statements made by the student, there was insufficient evidence to convict defendant of sexual misconduct with a minor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a successive appeal arising from a guardianship proceeding, the ward appealed the awards of guardian fees, attorney fees, and costs to the guardian. The court affirmed, stating that under both a substantial evidence and a de novo review of the challenged factual findings, the record supported them. There was no breach of any fiduciary duty owed by the guardian to the ward. Additionally, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 11.92.010 was not unconstitutional. The trial court patiently considered extensive litigation of matters involving 12 superior court hearings and 6 interlocutory rulings by the court's commissioner. The ward simply failed to establish the existence of a constitutional right to unlimited court access provided by the guardian statutes. The award of attorney fees was proper pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 11.96A.150 because there was no breach by the guardian or its counsel, and the ward dis not contest either the reasonableness of the number of hours or the billing rate. Thus, there was no basis for reversing the trial court's attorney fee award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission and a private landowner (hereinafter, the Commission), agreed on an exchange of State owned land for private land. Appellants, several other citizens of the locale (the citizens), disputed the valuation of the State land. The Superior Court of San Juan County, Washington, held the Washington Administrative Procedure Act (APA) precluded judicial review. The citizens sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission had filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, asserting the APA exempted its decision from judicial review. On appeal, the Commission asserted that under either Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.05.010(3)(a) or (c), the APA excluded from the definition of &quot;agency action&quot; its approval of the land exchange. The citizens contended that a land exchange was not a simple acquisition of real estate and therefore Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.05.010(3)(a) did not apply. The appellate court concluded that the plain language of &sect; 34.05.010(3)(a) indicated that the Washington Legislature intended the exception to be broad because it exempted from judicial review real estate acquisitions by any means. It was apparent the legislature considered an exchange of real estate to be a means of acquisition. For example, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 79.36.310 authorized the Washington Department of Natural Resources to acquire property interests to access state lands. The appellate court held the APA excluded from judicial review agency decisions to acquire real estate by any means and an exchange was a means of acquisition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the father contended the trial court erred in dismissing his claim.

In addition, the cause of action the father advocated was not in the best interests of the child; it was not in the child's best interests to be used as a vehicle for one parent to extract money from the other. The father's allegation that the dismissal of his claim for loss of consortium constituted unconstitutional sexual discrimination was not considered by the appellate court as the academic article he asked the appellate court to consider regarding how fathers were alienated of their children's affections twice as often as mothers was not before the trial court and was not in the record on appeal. The father's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim failed because he did not include it in his amended complaint; since &sect; 1983 claims had to be pleaded with specificity, the trial court did not err by not considering it.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that defendant never filed a written motion contesting the legality of his arrest.

He deprived the State of an opportunity to present evidence on the legality of his arrest. Defendant waived review of whether a scientific foundation was required under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.502(4) where at trial, the State offered the breath test results without first laying a scientific foundation. Defendant told the court he did not object. The instruction did not improperly comment on the evidence where it did no more than accurately state the law. The appellate court had no way to review defendant's claim that his driving record should not have been admitted because there was no foundation. Defendant did not include the exhibit number and did not include the document in the record on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington), which convicted him for the failure to register as a sex offender in violation of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for failure to register as a sex offender, arguing that the registration statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130(4)(a)(i), was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to advise registrants that they must register after release from confinement for probation violations regardless of whether their registration information changed since their initial registration upon release into probationary status. The court disagreed and affirmed, stating that the statute was not void for vagueness under the Fourteenth Amendment. Confinement on the basis of probation violations was a continuing consequence of the original prosecution rather than part of a new prosecution. Although probation status might determine the degree of restraint, the restraint was still a result of the original offense. Furthermore, nothing in the statute suggested that a prior registration exempted a registrant from later registration requirements as long as the registrant was returning to the same address. Later restraint based on probation violations was a continuing consequence of the original offense, and the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of King County (Washington) convicted defendant following a jury trial of two counts of first degree child molestation involving his girlfriend's younger sister. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in excluding an affidavit filed by the victim's mother in a petition for a protection order against the victim's father, and challenged a condition of community custody regarding possession of pornography.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant molested his girlfriend's 11-year old sister. During trial, the defense sought to introduce an affidavit the victim's mother filed in support of a petition for a protection order restraining the victim's father. The defense theory was that the mother used official court proceedings to control the men in her life. Citing Wash. R. Evid. 608, the trial court excluded it as irrelevant and inadmissible. As the mother would have testified that she actually filed the affidavit and that its allegations were true, the trial court properly concluded that the affidavit was inadmissible under Rule 608. But the trial court also reasonably concluded that the affidavit was not relevant as substantive evidence under Wash. R. Evid. 404(b). Because the actual allegations in the affidavit were not relevant to the defense theory and the State did not challenge the witness's testimony that such an affidavit existed, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the affidavit. The appellate court concluded the trial court should amend the community placement condition to provide a more specific definition consistent with defendant's treatment status and goals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his right to confrontation was violated when statements made by the 911 caller were admitted into evidence. The court of appeals disagreed. The State merely pointed out that the 911 caller indicated that he saw defendant climb over the fence and enter the area of the trailers. Defendant admitted that in his own testimony. Moreover, in closing argument, defense counsel used the statements attributed to the 911 caller as a means of impeaching the credibility of an officer. The properly admitted evidence was more than sufficient to prove defendant's guilt. Defendant was seen rummaging though desk drawers inside the locked trailer and was caught with the stolen property. Therefore, any error resulting from the admission of the 911 caller's statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the court miscalculated his offender score when it used his prior Oregon conviction for identity theft. In addition, the State failed to prove that he had been convicted of burglary in California.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on two counts of first-degree assault, one for each stabbing victim, and the jury found he was armed with a deadly weapon during each. The trial court found that the two assaults were separate and distinct criminal conduct and imposed consecutive sentences, as well as consecutive two-year terms for each deadly weapon enhancement. Defendant challenged the deadly weapon sentence enhancements and calculation of his sentencing range. The appellate court agreed that the sentencing range was miscalculated. The right to have a jury determine all of the facts necessary to support consecutive sentencing did not apply to the imposition of consecutive sentences for two or more serious violent offenses under Wash.

A year later he was charged with second degree rape with forcible compulsion. He was again adjudged incompetent to stand trial. The State petitioned to commit him as a sexually violent predator (SVP) under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.09. The jury found the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the detainee committed second degree rape with forcible compulsion. The court determined that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the detainee was an SVP and was likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence in the future if not confined to a secure facility. He was committed. He challenged the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.060(2), both facially and as it was applied to him. However, SVP proceedings were civil and as such did not constitute prosecution under a criminal statute. The statute did not violate due process by permitting an individual previously found to be incompetent to stand trial in a criminal proceeding to be committed as a sexually violent predator. The trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police arrested defendant and the State charged him with three counts of second degree rape-domestic violence, and one count of first degree assault-domestic violence, with a firearm.

He challenged the automatic decline on several grounds, including violations of his constitutional rights to equal protection and due process. The appellate court concluded that the automatic decline statute afforded equal protection of law if the class to be protected was all juveniles charged with a serious violent offense. And the Washington Supreme Court had already held that the statute did not deny due process. The appellate court also concluded the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to admit evidence of an e-mail suggesting the victim would have consented to violence and rape, citing the rape shield statute. Defendant did not have a constitutional right to be tried in juvenile court. He was not deprived of procedural due process; he was properly tried as an adult.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to five counts of delivery of methamphetamine and one count of possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver. The Superior Court of Kitsap County, Washington, imposed concurrent sentences of 108 months. He did not appeal. Two years later defendant filed a motion for relief from judgment under Wash. Super.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not appeal his guilty plea or the sentences imposed. Two years later he filed the present motion on the grounds that the controlled substance that he had intended to sell was methamphetamine hydrochloride not methamphetamine. Thus, defendant claimed that he was improperly convicted and sentenced under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii). The trial court denied defendant's Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8(b)(1) motion as untimely under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090. The appellate court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion as the motion was filed more than a year after the judgment, defendant's judgment was valid on its face within the meaning of &sect; 10.73.090 as it showed on its face that defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of unlawful possession of methamphetamine; that such crime carried a maximum sentence of 10 years; and that he was sentenced to not more than ten years. Defendant's sentence was not &quot;in excess of the court's jurisdiction,&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100 because the expert who opined that defendant only delivered methamphetamine hydrochloride did not examine, or even see, the specific substance that defendant was charged with delivering.</SPAN></P>

The individual arranged, in presence of the arresting officer, to buy methamphetamine from defendant. When defendant and the co-defendant arrived at a designated area, the individual handed the money to the co-defendant, and defendant got a bag containing a white, powdery substance that was later confirmed to be methamphetamine to give to the individual. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court improperly commented on the evidence by telling the jury that one of the exhibits contained methamphetamine. The appellate court rejected this argument as no one at trial had disputed that the substance was methamphetamine. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the trial court erred in treating two convictions committed on the same day as separate offenses as under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp; 9.94A.589(1)(a), there was no evidence that the crimes involved the same criminal intent or occurred at the same place and time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Cowlitz County (Washington) convicted defendant of driving while license suspended (DWLS) and unlawful possession of a controlled substance (UPCS). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police initiated the stop because he recognized defendant and police dispatch had confirmed his suspicion that defendant's driver's license was suspended. A search of defendant's van incident to his arrest led to the discovery of methamphetamine. On appeal, he argued that: (1) the State improperly commented on his right to remain silent; and (2) the officers lacked probable cause to stop him because certain statutes related to the predicate criminal statute were subsequently held unconstitutional under City of Redmond v. Moore. Defendant's license was suspended under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.289. He was therefore entitled under Moore to have his DWLS conviction vacated. His conviction for UPCS had to be reversed because the State violated his right to remain silent by commenting on it and such error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. But the appellate court rejected defendant's contention that the methamphetamine should have been suppressed as the result of an unlawful stop. The officers had probable cause to stop and arrest defendant, and Moore did not vitiate the probable cause for defendant's arrest. Thus, the case was remanded for a new trial on the UPCS charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Pacific County (Washington) convicted appellant of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance, marijuana.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order denying his motion to correct sentence, an order denying his motion for reconsideration of that order, an order denying his motion for an exceptional sentence downward, an order clarifying the order denying his motion for an exceptional sentence downward, and an order denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. He escaped from custody in 1993, was taken back into custody in 2001, and was serving his 51-month sentence plus an additional 8 months for the escape. He filed a personal restraint petition asserting that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel because his attorney was under the influence of alcohol during court proceedings. The petition was dismissed because he filed it more than one year after his judgment and sentence were final. He had one year to file a petition for post-conviction relief and Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 10.73.090 and 10.73.100 applied to him. His appeals were consolidated. The appellate court gave appellant actual notice of the one-year time limit in its order dismissing his personal restraint petition. He failed to make his claims within that year.

The trooper asked for defendant's license, registration, and proof of insurance. Defendant explained to the trooper that he did not have a driver's license, and instead was willing to provide a Washington Identification card. When defendant opened his wallet to get the card, a small clear plastic bag fell out of the wallet and onto defendant's lap. The trooper took custody of the baggie and defendant admitted, after being read his rights pursuant to Miranda, that the baggie contained methamphetamine. The appellate court reversed the grant of suppression of evidence and dismissal and remanded the matter for further proceedings as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.688 was not unconstitutionally vague because defendant never claimed that he believed his truck was exempt from &sect; 46.61.688, and the trooper was not required to know for sure that the vehicle was not exempt before he stopped defendant.</SPAN></P>

Because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.342(1)(a) made it unlawful to drive while license suspended, the officers were permitted to conduct the searches incident to his arrest.

The officer searched the fanny pack she was wearing, which contained a plastic tube containing a residue of methamphetamine. Defendant sought to have the evidence suppressed, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's claim that the drug evidence seized should have been suppressed under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;7 because her arrest for driving with a suspended license under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.289 was unlawful under case law. Because defendant admitted that her license was suspended and a records check confirmed that information, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.31.100(3)(e), the officer's arrest of defendant was permissible, and the evidence seized pursuant to that arrest was also admissible, despite the subsequent invalidation of the driving while license suspended statutes in case law. The court noted that the statutes were not flagrantly unconstitutional and provided probable cause for defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for third degree driving while his license was suspended. The record on appeal did not reveal on what basis the defendant's license had been suspended. Incident to that arrest, the officer searched defendant and found methamphetamine in his pants pocket. Prior to trial, defendant's attorney moved to suppress the methamphetamine and argued that because the state supreme court had recently held that former Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.20.289 and 46.20.324(1) were unconstitutional in that they required suspension of a driver's license without a hearing, the that the search was illegal because it was based solely upon the arrest for third degree driving while license suspended. The appellate court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress and held that because the record did not indicate that defendant's license was suspended pursuant to the unconstitutional statutes, he was not entitled to relief. The appellate court also held that defendant was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel as defendant's motion would have been denied even if his attorney had argued that his arrest could not be justified under a good faith exception.</SPAN></P>

Defendant provided a factual basis for the plea by admitting to the charged facts. Defendant had no prior felony convictions, resulting in a 12 to 14 month standard sentencing range. The court imposed an exceptional 24 month sentence based on its belief that two victims in one count implicated the statutory aggravating factor that the &quot;multiple offense policy&quot; of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 that resulted in a presumptive sentence that was clearly too lenient. Defendant appealed and claimed that under Blakely, which was decided six days after he was sentenced, the trial court could not impose an exceptional sentence without a factual determination by a jury. The appellate court agreed, reversed defendant's and remanded for resentencing. The appellate court noted that the sentencing court increased defendant's sentence beyond that supported by the guilty plea alone when it made findings of fact based on a preponderance of evidence, a procedure declared unconstitutional by Blakely.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of public nuisance and two counts of pedestrian interference for panhandling. The Superior Court for Spokane County (Washington) found insufficient evidence of&nbsp;&quot;aggressive solicitation&quot; but found defendant guilty of two counts of pedestrian interference in violation of former Spokane, Wash., Municipal Code &sect; 10.10.025(C) and (D) (1994). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to former &sect; 10.10.025(C) and (D), a person committed misdemeanor pedestrian interference if, in a public place, he or she intentionally (1) obstructed pedestrian or vehicular traffic or (2) aggressively solicited. The trial court specifically found that defendant had not aggressively panhandled. The appellate court held, therefore, that she could not have been found to have violated the ordinance. The pedestrian interference ordinance proscribed only &quot;aggressive solicitation&quot; and no other forms of begging. The judge found insufficient evidence at trial to determine there had been &quot;aggressive solicitation.&quot; Former &sect; 10.10.025(B)(4) specifically exempted constitutionally protected activity from its purview. Begging was constitutionally protected. From the language of the ordinance, one could legally beg as long as he or she did not do so aggressively. An obstruction to pedestrian traffic by defendant was incidental to the non-proscribed and constitutionally protected activity of non-aggressive begging. The appellate court thus held that the city had failed to prove that defendant had violated the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of King County, Washington, granted judgment in favor of respondent fire protection district on appellant citizen's claim that the district's policy of prohibiting possession of firearms by visitors to the district property violated state statutes and the federal and state constitutional right to bear arms. The superior court dismissed the citizen's suit. The citizen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen challenged the district policy on three grounds: statutory preemption of local firearms regulation; the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution; and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 24. The appellate court rejected the citizen's claim of statutory exemption where the fire district policy did not fall within the scope of the criminal firearms regulations that a prior court viewed as governed by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.290. The citizen failed to cite any authority for his contention that the Second Amendment was made applicable to the states and consequently to entities such as the district that were created by state law. The claim that the district's policy violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 24 also failed. The right to bear arms was not absolute, but instead was subject to reasonable regulation by the State under its police power. The limited effect on the general right to bear arms presented by the district's policy was minimal in comparison to the obvious benefit to the public of enhancing the safety of firefighters and paramedics on the job.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the no-contact order unconstitutionally burdened his parental rights and was therefore void. He contended that the trial court's oral ruling extended the prohibition to contact with his son as well. The instant court concluded that the trial court's oral remarks had no legal force since they were never incorporated into the judgments or the no-contact order. Moreover, the instant court did not read the trial court's oral remarks as prohibiting defendant from all contact with his son. At most, they prohibited defendant from visiting his children in the mother's presence. Finally, the trial court's judgments and no-contact order only prohibited direct or indirect contact with the mother. That prohibition was necessary to protect the mother and did not substantially restrict defendant's parental rights. Because the no-contact order applied only to the mother, was necessary to protect her, and did not prevent defendant from arranging for contact with his child, it did not unconstitutionally infringe his right to parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant got into an altercation with the victim and stabbed him. Defendant claimed that the victim attacked defendant first. The court held that sufficient evidence supported a conviction for first degree assault with a deadly weapon in that defendant's conduct in leaving the victim's bedroom after a verbal altercation and then returning with a knife to commit a lengthy and violent assault was alone sufficient to support the finding of assault and the intent to inflict great bodily harm. The court also held that assault with a deadly weapon in Washington encompassed the California assault definition and was comparable to the California crime of second degree assault with a deadly weapon and that defendant's Utah offense was comparable to second degree assault in Washington. The State presented out-of-state charging documents, plea paperwork, and statutory provisions to the sentencing court to establish comparability. Defendant admitted the facts contained in the paperwork when he pleaded guilty to the out-of-state offenses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attacked his wife and ended up in a standoff with police. The trial court precluded the insanity defense, but it allowed the defense of diminished capacity. The court affirmed and held that substantial evidence did not support an insanity defense given the conflicting expert testimony and testimony by one expert that defendant was malingering. Further, because defendant raised the insanity and incompetence issues himself, it was reasonable for him to anticipate that the State's mental health experts would challenge his expert's testimony at trial. As to defendant becoming incompetent during trial, the court noted that before defendant's outburst, nothing in the record indicated that he was incompetent to stand trial. Also, the trial court properly admitted statements that defendant made to an officer while in custody for driving with a suspended license because the record did not indicate that defendant's license was suspended under the provision that had been held unconstitutional. The court also held that the prosecutor's misstatement of law that there was such a thing as a voluntary intoxication defense was not sufficiently inflammatory to affect the verdict.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by police for a traffic infraction. The officers observed defendant make furtive gestures toward the passenger side of the vehicle while he was stopping defendant's vehicle. The officers learned that defendant's driving privilege was suspended. The officer searched the vehicle pursuant to the arrest for driving while license suspended. During the search, the officer uncovered a glass smoking pipe under the driver's seat and a baggie with white powder in the pocket of pants found in a bag on the front seat. Defendant argued that the evidence obtained from the search of his vehicle was inadmissible. The appellate court ruled that the search of defendant's vehicle was proper. The stipulated facts revealed that defendant's driving privilege was suspended. Nothing in the record established that defendant's license was suspended under one of the provisions found unconstitutional by the Washington Supreme Court. Hence, the appellate court had to assume that defendant was lawfully arrested and that the subsequent search of the vehicle was also lawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After blood tests showed that appellant alleged father was the child's biological father, the alleged father petitioned the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington) for an order establishing paternity and granting him residential visitation. The trial court essentially ruled for respondent presumptive father and dismissed the alleged father's paternity and visitation actions. The alleged father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the child was born, respondent mother was involved in an 11-year cohabitation relationship with the presumptive father. The child's birth certificate identified him as the child's father, and the presumptive father filed an acknowledgment of paternity with the State Department of Vital Statistics (Washington). The trial court concluded that the stability of the present home environment would be better maintained by denying the alleged father's paternity action. That conclusion was supported by the unchallenged findings that the presumptive father provided consistency for the child and that the child had lived with the presumptive father most of his life. Also, the trial court concluded that there was no uncertainty of parentage in the child's mind as the presumptive father was the only father he had ever known. Further, the trial court concluded that the continuity of established family relationships would be better maintained if the alleged father's parentage action was denied. Thus, the trial court properly determined that the child's best interests were served by dismissing the alleged father's paternity action in favor of continuing the presumptive father's paternity.</SPAN></P>

The officer ran a check of the vehicle's license plate and learned that the vehicle had been sold more than 45 days before but had not been re-registered, a misdemeanor. The officer stopped the vehicle, and the passenger was arrested on outstanding warrants. The officer conducted a search of defendant's vehicle incident to the passenger's arrest and found a baggie of methamphetamine. Defendant argued that his counsel was ineffective for failing to bring a motion to suppress evidence that was seized from his vehicle in a search incident to the arrest of the passenger. The appellate court ruled that defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed. As a result of the passenger's seat belt violation, the officer had a legal basis to stop defendant's vehicle and obtain the passenger's information. The passenger's arrest provided a valid reason for the incidental search of defendant's vehicle. Because the search of defendant's vehicle was lawful, defense counsel was not deficient for failing to bring a suppression motion.</SPAN></P>

The procedural provisions in Wash. Rev.

Rev. Code &sect; 82.38.180(3) of the Special Fuel Tax Act (SFTA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 82.38.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business used &quot;special fuel&quot; for its operations. An auditor determined that the business had not received power take-off (PTO) tax credits to which it was entitled. The credit was calculated for the 21-month audit period, but the DOL's assessment limited the credit to a 13-month period. The business claimed that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 82.38.180(3) and 82.38.190(3)(b) granted it five years to pursue PTO refunds, but the court held that the up front payment of the special fuel tax was not an erroneously or illegally paid tax. Section 82.38.190(3)(b) precluded a refund without a timely claim. However, the business was entitled to a refund under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.38.180(1) because the audit included recalculating the business's initial tax obligation. The court also held that the business failed to present its equal protection argument for review because the business assumed that the DOL and it were similarly situated, but it cited no authority or argument for this proposition. Nor did the business cite authority for the proposition that a party's lack of knowledge of a statutorily established procedure demonstrated the constitutional deficiency of that procedure.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 9A.82.050(1) (2001) and misdemeanor bail jumping under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.170(1). Defendant sold a rented television.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his plea and in calculating his offender score and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when he pleaded guilty. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying the motion to withdraw the plea without a hearing under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8(c)(2) as the motion did not establish grounds for relief where the record showed he had proper notice of the charge to which he was pleading and that there was a factual basis for the plea. The court found that the record showed defendant not only obtained wrongful control over the television from the rental company by theft but that he also traded it to another person, which supported the additional element of trafficking of stolen property found in former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.82.050. The court rejected defendant's claims regarding his offender score because his prior forgery convictions were committed on three different dates and involved three different victims; thus they did not qualify as the same criminal conduct as defined in Wash.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PDC found that the senator's political opponent violated &sect; 42.17.530(1)(a) in that she acted with &quot;actual malice or reckless disregard&quot; in sponsoring a brochure that stated the senator had voted to reduce funds for and to close a facility for the developmentally challenged because the opponent had actual knowledge that the senator had not voted to close the facility and she failed to make even a cursory check of the senator's voting record.

The residents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents argued that the department had only the power the legislature gave it, and that nothing in the budget bills specifically directed it to implement downsizing. The appellate court noted that the legislature expected that the school would be downsized. The department had the authority to downsize the school without express legislative directive. Nothing in the statutes required that the school be maintained in a static condition. The legislature had greater latitude under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 in appropriations bills, because budget bills allocated funds to a number of state needs. The budget bills were not substantive. The school's size was not the subject of separate legislation, did not effect changes beyond the two-year budget period, and did not define rights or eligibility for services. The budget bills did not change the scope of effect of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 71A.20.020 or 71.16.010(1). They did not require the department to close the school or affect the ability of persons with developmental disabilities to exercise choice as to where they live. The trial court did not err in allowing the Washington Protection and Advocacy System to participate as amicus.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Sufficient evidence existed to support the finding of a recent overt act. The patient approached a child and offered him a small amount of money to follow him. When the boy hesitated, the patient attempted to grab the boy's arm. The patient was a diagnosed pedophile with a 20-year history of sexually molesting prepubescent children using a grooming technique where he offered his victims candy and money to promote their contact with him. The grooming of the victims permitted the patient to commit a &quot;sexually violent offense&quot; as defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(15). The patient's contact with the child was consistent with that pattern of obtaining the contact with his victims except for the fact that the contact occurred in an alley, not an apartment. However, that deviation was explained by the patient's housing difficulties on the day of the incident.</SPAN></P>

Moore, holding that statutes providing for mandatory suspension of a driver's license without an administrative hearing violated procedural due process rights. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress because her arrest and the resulting search and seizure were not lawful based upon Moore. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that police had probable cause at the time of her arrest and that Moore did not apply retroactively to render defendant's arrest unconstitutional. The appellate court noted that the record did not specify under which statutory section of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.342(1)(c) defendant's license was suspended; therefore, she had not shown that her license was suspended under one of the unconstitutional license suspension provisions. The appellate court concluded that defendant had failed to show that the police unlawfully stopped and arrested her, unlawfully searched her incident to that arrest, and unlawfully seized the methamphetamine in her possession; therefore, the trial court did not err in denying her motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 18.185.110(10) and revoking his bond individual agent and agency licenses for five years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bondsman's employee failed to renew her license, and the bail bonds program manager informed the bondsman that he could not have the employee working in the office. An undercover DOL investigator discovered that the employee was handling bond business at the office with a licensed bondsman executing the bond. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.185.010(6)'s definition of &quot;bail bond agent&quot; was plain and that common knowledge and understanding of the bail bond profession clearly encompassed the employee's actions. Therefore, &sect; 18.185.010(6) was not vague as applied to the employee's actions. Reports showed that the employee was the sole negotiator on multiple bonds involving deeds of trust. It was unnecessary to read into former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.185.110(10) the criminal standard of accomplice liability as the DOL did not charge the bondsman with violating a criminal statute. He knew that the employee was selling bonds without a license. While the five-year license revocation was harsh, the Director of the DOL took the action with due consideration in that the bondsman received a hearing and the Director carefully reviewed the testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the petitioner was convicted in 1994 of attempted robbery in the first degree and attempted murder in the second degree and sentenced to 300 months' confinement, the sentencing court ordered the petitioner to pay restitution. Since the petitioner was still incarcerated, he did not yet have a community corrections officer, and no payment schedule was set. The petitioner argued that because his restitution order required restitution to be paid on a schedule established by his community corrections officer, collection was to be deferred until he was released. The appellate court ruled that the DOC was permitted to start collecting restitution even though the petitioner remained incarcerated, had no community corrections officer, and no payment schedule had ever been set. The petitioner had no vested rights to the contrary. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.772 changed the Sentencing Reform Act, Wash. Rev.

In the hearing on the admissibility of appellant's statements, the State offered a certification from the Washington Department of Licensing (DOL), indicating that there was no record of a driver's license for appellant. The defense had objected, claiming the certification was hearsay. The appellate court held: (1) there was no seizure at the point of encounter between appellant and the officer, and because there was an independent cause to question appellant, his state constitutional rights were not violated when the officer asked him to identify himself; (2) appellant was not in custody before his confession, and he was not entitled to Miranda warnings; (3) the certified copy of the absence of a driver's license was admissible because the document was not testimonial and thus unavailability of an agency custodian of same was irrelevant; and (4) a public record was the functional equivalent of a business record for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.</SPAN></P>

He argued that using an unproven charge to enhance a sentence violates due process. The court sentenced defendant as a prior offender under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&nbsp;46.61.5055(11)(a)(vii). Defendant appealed and claimed that the trial court erred in using defendant's prior deferred prosecution to enhance his sentence in violation of his due process rights and the principles established in Blakely v. Washington. The appellate court affirmed the sentence imposed and held that (1) defendant was not deprived of due process because defendant stipulated to the admissibility and sufficiency of the facts in the police report for the prior DUI in order to receive the deferred prosecution, and (2) the United States Supreme Court in deciding Blakely noted that its decision did not implicate earlier decisions upholding judicial fact-finding to establish mandatory minimums. Consistent with Blakely, the lower court used the fact of defendant's prior deferred prosecution to establish a minimum sentence. Thus, it properly sentenced him within the standard range.</SPAN></P>

An industrial appeals judge found that the violation was the result of unavoidable employee misconduct and vacated the citation and penalty. The industrial insurance appeals board reversed, and the Superior Court of Kitsap County, Washington, affirmed. The contractor sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the contractor contended, inter alia, that the department failed to establish a prima facie violation of the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 49.17, and that the board erred in rejecting its statutory affirmative &quot;unpreventable employee misconduct&quot; defense. The appellate court found that the contractor did not argue that extraordinary circumstances excused its failure to timely object, and that its counsel conceded that the violation occurred. Further, substantial evidence supported the board's finding that the contractor did not effectively communicate the safety rules to its employees, that the contractor's unannounced inspections were infrequent, and that the employees caught violating the rules were not consistently counseled or fined. As such, the board properly determined that the contractor did not prove each element of its statutory affirmative &quot;unpreventable employee misconduct&quot; defense under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.17.120.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for a traffic infraction. The police officer checked the licensing records, which showed that defendant's license had been suspended in the third degree. The officer arrested defendant for violating Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.342(1)(c). In searching defendant incident to the arrest, the officer found a pipe of the type used to smoke drugs, pills, heroin, and cocaine. After being read his Miranda rights, defendant told the police that there was cocaine, heroin, and syringes in his car. The police then searched the car and found heroin, cocaine, and drug paraphernalia. Defendant argued that as his license suspension was unconstitutional, his arrest was thereby invalid, and evidence seized as a result of the unlawful arrest was inadmissible under the exclusionary rule of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was admissible under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.31.100(3)(e) as the police were not required to know whether defendant was afforded due process when his license was suspended to have probable cause to arrest him for driving while license suspended, and then conduct a search subsequent to the arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judgment debtors moved to vacate respondent assignee's 1996 extension of the judgment, contending it was void ab initio under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.17.020(3) (1996). The Superior Court of King County, Washington, denied appellants' motion to vacate the order extending the judgment, from which they appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judgment was entered against appellants in 1986. The judgment creditor assigned it to the assignee; in 1996, prior to its expiration date, the assignee obtained an order extending the judgment for 10 years. In 2001, the court of appeals held that under then-existing statutory law, only judgment creditors could seek extension orders; assignees could not. Former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.17.020(3) (1996) was amended in 2002 to allow assignees to seek extension orders, and &sect; 6.17.020(8) (2002) provided that the amendment applied to all judgments extended after June 9, 1994. The assignee argued that the 2002 amendments retroactively validated the 1996 extension. The appellate court disagreed. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.56.210 (a nonclaim statute, not a statute of limitations), when the 10-year period to execute on the judgment expired, the judgment lien ceased to exist and no action could be taken under the judgment. The legislature's attempt to substantively change Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.17.020(3) and to apply the amendment retroactively violated the separation of powers doctrine. Therefore, the 2002 amendment to &sect; 6.17.020(3) had only prospective application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denying defendants' motion to suppress in a joint trial, the Superior Court of Thurston County, Washington, convicted defendants for unlawful possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver and unlawful manufacture of methamphetamine. They were sentenced within the standard range, including a 24-month sentence enhancement for unlawful manufacture in the presence of a minor. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendants contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying their motion to suppress as the arresting officer did not have an articulable suspicion to perform an investigatory stop. The appellate court found that because defendant driver did not specify under which statutory section his license was suspended, defendants did not show that defendant driver's license was suspended under one of the unconstitutional provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.342. Further, the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant driver for driving with a suspended license based on a department of licensing report he received. Thus, the subsequent investigatory stop incident to arrest was proper where evidence of drug possession, intent to sell, and manufacture was found. As defendant driver failed to show that his license was suspended under one of the unconstitutional provisions of &sect; 46.20.342, he could not show that his counsel was ineffective for failing to argue the point. The extensive methamphetamine and manufacturing equipment, coupled with defendants' close relationship, was sufficient evidence to support their convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington), which gave assessed a life sentence under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA) for his conviction for attempted second degree rape. It was determined that defendant's prior Montana attempted robbery conviction and prior federal aggravated assault convictions counted as &quot;strikes&quot; for purposes of the POAA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed his convictions were facially invalid. The court affirmed, and held that neither the Montana attempted robbery conviction nor the federal conviction were facially invalid because the convictions indicated that defendant was represented by counsel. Also, the POAA did not violate the single subject requirement of Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. The court also held that Wash. R. App. P. 16.4(c)(4) and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73(6) applied to changes in the law that occurred after a petitioner's conviction and/or sentence. Counsel's waiver of a challenge to the comparability of the offenses was not ineffective assistance because Montana's attempt statute was narrower than Washington's, and while the Montana robbery statute was broader than Washington's, and the information was not included in the record so the court could not conclude that defendant's conduct violated the comparable Washington statute, defendant did not show that if his counsel had argued that the crimes were not comparable and that the sentencing court was not entitled to rely on the included materials, the court likely would not have given the State the opportunity to procure the information.</SPAN></P>

However, as the State pointed out, the motion to withdraw was barred by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090 because it was filed more than one year after the judgment was final. Because the motion to withdraw was not filed within the time allowed by &sect; 10.73.090, it was barred. Furthermore, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100(1) did not exempt defendant's motion to withdraw from the one year limit of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090 because (1) defendant's claim that the confession was the only evidence against him and should have been suppressed or that counsel should have pursued suppression was not newly discovered evidence; it might have been a newly discovered argument but it was not evidence; and (2) the confession was not the only evidence against defendant because his daughter reported the abuse to the police and that fact was set out in the certificate of probable cause. Because defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea was untimely, it was barred. Therefore, defendant's motion was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff private guaranty agency sued defendant employer for failing to respond to a wage-withholding order arising from its employee's default on student loans obtained under the Federal Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), 20 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1070-99. The Superior Court of Thurston County, Washington, denied the employer's motion for dismissal and ordered it to comply with the wage-withholding order. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the employer argued, inter alia, that the wage-withholding order was defective. The appellate court found that the employer did not assert any injury to its own personal rights. The property at risk was the employee's, and any injury resulting from its deprivation inured to her alone. Instead, the employer asserted the employee's personal rights, purportedly in an attempt to avoid a speculative wrongful-withholding lawsuit by the employee. But the employee was neither a party to this action nor had she successfully assigned her personal rights to the employer to act on her behalf in this matter. Moreover, the employer did not show how its interests as an employer, potentially subject to suit, were within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the laws it cited. Therefore, the employer lacked standing to raise its claims of unlawful delegations of authority, due process, and statutory notice, and the trial court properly dismissed the employer's claims. The agency was entitled to attorney fees and costs under 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1095a(a)(6) as the employer refused to order the garnishment order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the misdemeanor harassment conviction, that there was reversible instructional error, and that the trial court erred in admitting irrelevant evidence of a prior incident. The appellate court found that the conduct and demeanor of defendant as testified to by the victim was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find that the victim was placed in reasonable fear and that defendant would carry out her threats of bodily injury to him. The facts of the incident suggested that a reasonable person in defendant's position would foresee that her comments could be interpreted seriously. However, the jury was erroneously instructed that it could convict defendant under a subsection of the harassment statute that had been declared unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The jury was erroneously instructed it could convict defendant under a statutory alternative, not charged in the information, that was not a lesser alternative. The errors could not be deemed harmless. The evidence of the seven-year-old incident admitted by the trial court was not relevant as there was no evidence that defendant had anything to do with it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, for the offenses of drive-by shooting and tampering with a witness. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testimony at trial established that a shooter discharged a firearm and shot at a residence. Witnesses testified that they observed the shooter standing near a vehicle and flee in the vehicle following the shooting. When that vehicle was traced to defendant, further evidence suggested that he told the owner of the car to lie to police about when he returned it to her. The primary question on appeal was whether the evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant discharged a firearm from the immediate area of a motor vehicle under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.045(1). The appellate court held that there was no evidence that the firearm had been discharged from the immediate area of a motor vehicle; therefore, it could only discern that shots were fired outside the residence during either a walk-by or a drive-by shooting and that a rational trier of fact could not have found beyond a reasonable doubt that a firearm was discharged from the immediate area of a motor vehicle. However, the appellate court concluded that defendant's failure to object to the allegedly improper hearsay evidence waived that issue on appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's drive-by shooting conviction was reversed; however, his tampering with a witness conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's driver's license had been suspended, and the officer arrested defendant and searched him incident to that arrest. The officer found two small baggies of methamphetamine in defendant's waistband. Defendant argued that the Washington Supreme Court held Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.342(1)(c) to be unconstitutional. Defendant challenged his conviction based solely on the argument that his initial arrest under the statute and the search incident to that arrest were unlawful. The appellate court ruled that the arrest was supported by probable cause and the subsequent search was also justified. Driving with a suspended license was still a crime, as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.342(1)(c) was not declared unconstitutional. Also, defendant failed to satisfy his burden that his possession was unwitting. The baggies were found in defendant's waistband, and the manner in which the baggies were concealed indicated that there was some effort to conceal or otherwise not make the methamphetamine readily apparent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Snohomish County, Washington, found defendant juvenile guilty of taking a motor vehicle without permission and imposed a 86 to 108 week manifest injustice disposition. The instant court granted accelerated review and reversed because the trial court failed to consider mitigating factors. On remand, the trial court applied mitigating and aggravating factors but imposed the same sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the trial court concluded that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors. In that respect, defendant was 15 at the time of the instant offense, which was committed in 2003. However, in 1999, he had received manifest injustice disposition for second degree assault, when he set a boy's hair on fire and attempted to set a girl's hair on fire. In 2001, he had received manifest injustice dispositions for second degree malicious mischief and third degree theft. In two cases, after he was released from custody, he &quot;went on the run.&quot; He also committed all but the first offense while on probation. Based on Washington precedent, the appellate court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.04.021(2), the statute that allowed juvenile offenders to be tried without a jury, and his argument that either Crawford v. Washington and Blakely v. Washington implied a right to a jury trial for juvenile offenses or required changing the burden of proof for a manifest injustice disposition from the &quot;clear and convincing&quot; standard to proof &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; The appellate court also rejected his argument that his disposition was excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father was convicted in the Superior Court of King County, Washington, of the domestic assault of the mother in the fourth degree. As a result, a no-contact order (NCO) was imposed pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.99.050 prohibiting the father from contacting the mother, but the NCO did not prohibit him from having contact with his children. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that order prohibiting his contact with the mother had a consequence of precluding contact with his children. Thus, he argued that it impermissibly interfered with his fundamental right to parent, and claimed that the statute authorizing the order was unconstitutional on its face and that the resulting order was invalid. The appellate court noted that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.99.050(1) authorized the issuance of no-contact orders in cases of domestic violence. The appellate court held that the NCO did not prohibit the father from having contact with his children, it only prohibited contact with the mother of his children; therefore, the father could not show that the statute interfered with his right to parent, at least as constitutionally recognized. The appellate court further held that while the NCO as imposed might have been an inconvenience, any interference was not substantial or beyond that which was justified by the need to protect the mother of the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At sentencing, the State asked the trial court to find that the crime constituted a crime of harassment for purposes of entering a no-contact order. The trial court made its finding and ordered no contact with the victim, and defendant was sentenced to the middle of the standard range. Defendant argued that a jury was required to make the determination of whether robbery in the first degree was a crime of harassment. Defendant argued that in order to be convicted of the crime of harassment, a jury would have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that his actions fit the statutory definition of harassment. The appellate court ruled that the harassment finding had no impact on defendant's sentence for his current offense. No contact with the victim was a permissible crime-related prohibition, whether or not the trial court found the offense was a crime of harassment, and in the event that defendant ever harassed the victim again, he would be punished for that crime, not for the instant one. Also, defendant failed to show he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and failed to demonstrate that the prosecution committed misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that while the officer mistakenly arrested him for refusing to give his correct name in connection with her investigation of violation of a dangerous dog ordinance, the officer could have arrested him for failing to give his correct name in connection with an investigation of a traffic infraction: failure to wear a seatbelt. The appellate court found that the fact that defendant was not wearing a seatbelt in a car required by law to have a seatbelt was within the officer's knowledge. Also, the appellate court found that the fact that defendant was giving the officer a false name was within her knowledge. Thus, the appellate court found that the facts within the officer's knowledge would lead a reasonable person to believe that defendant had refused to give his name in connection with the investigation of a traffic infraction, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.61.021(3) and .022. Therefore, the officer could have arrested him. Accordingly, the search incident to defendant's arrest was lawful.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Undercover officers observed employees at the cabaret engaging in unlawful sexual conduct. The city then entered an order suspending the cabaret's license. The superior court affirmed this decision, and the cabaret sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the cabaret's right to an objective and disinterested adjudicator was not contravened. Due process was not violated because the hearing examiner did not have a direct, personal, and substantial pecuniary interest due to an at-will termination clause. Next, the court rejected the contention that the cabaret was not responsible for the acts of its employees under Shoreline, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 5.10.070 (1997). Even though owners were not held responsible under ordinance, the license could have been suspended under Shoreline, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 5.10.120 as a public nuisance. Case law also put the cabaret on notice that it could have lost its right to do business based on the acts of employees. Finally, Shoreline, Wash., Mun. Code &sect; 5.10.090 was not unconstitutional as vague, overbroad, or a prior restraint on free express under the First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that: (1) the voyeurism statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and (2) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Defendant could not mount a facial challenge because the statute did not punish thought, but instead regulated conduct. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's actions, nor was it overbroad. The court concluded that sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction. Defendant admitted he became sexually aroused after his daughter walked through the kitchen in a t-shirt. Defendant &quot;felt drawn&quot; to the utility room, intending to masturbate while watching his daughter shower. Defendant admitted that he saw her arm or shoulder when looking between the blinds and the wall. He then moved to the center of the blinds, which he separated to see more of her body. The daughter testified that she saw defendant's hands on the blinds for several seconds and that he acted without her consent. Substantial evidence showed that defendant knowingly viewed his daughter for purposes of sexual arousal and gratification, without her knowledge or consent, in a place where she had a reasonable expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction for felony harassment, arguing that the evidence was insufficient and that her counsel was ineffective. The court stated that her counsel proposed instructions that incorrectly laid out the elements of felony harassment. As a result, it was probable that the jury convicted her of felony harassment without having found all of the essential elements of that crime, denying her due process and a fair trial. The court further stated that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence that defendant had previously pulled a gun on her daughter's ex-husband pursuant to Wash. R. Evid. 404(b). The State offered evidence of the earlier gun incident to show that her daughter, the victim, was reasonably frightened by defendant's current threats. Because the evidence showed that defendant was capable of using a gun to enforce her threats, and that the daughter knew this, the evidence was relevant to show the daughter's fear during the current incident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in the custody of the Department of Corrections following a conviction on a 2002 harassment charge, defendant committed a series of prison disciplinary infractions and was eventually placed in the intensive management unit at a correctional center. On December 13, 2002, and January 21 and 22, 2003, he committed several additional serious infractions. Because he had apparently already lost all of his earned release time, the State charged him with three counts of persistent prison misbehavior. He was convicted and on appeal, the court affirmed, stating that his sufficiency argument failed. Although there might have been come confusion about his release date calculation, taken in the light most favorable to the State, a correctional records manager's testimony that defendant had used up all of his good conduct time and earned release credits prior to the incidents, was sufficient to support that element. Further, the statute was not vague because the definitions in Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 137-28-260(1) defined the prohibited conduct such that persons of common intelligence would understand their meaning and that there was no risk that a person would have to guess at their meaning.</SPAN></P>

The POAA was an act pertaining to recidivism and was constitutional. It permitted a sentencing court to employ a preponderance standard, and that court was not required to submit the matter to a jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, committed appellant detainee as a sexually violent predator (SVP). Appellant challenged the commitment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was previously convicted for attempted indecent liberties, which, according to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(15), was a sexually violent offense. At the time the petition was filed, appellant was incarcerated for third degree rape. Appellant argued that the county lacked authority to file an SVP petition while he was incarcerated for a crime that was not a sexually violent offense under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.09. Appellant also argued, inter alia, that chapter 71.09 violated ex post facto, due process, and equal protection; that the evidence was insufficient to support findings of mental abnormality and serious inability to control his sexually violent behavior. The appellate court rejected appellant's arguments. Third degree rape qualified as a recent &quot;overt act,&quot; as that term was statutorily defined. Appellant had a history of criminal sexual acts. A psychologist opined that appellant had a serious lack of control such that he was likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined to a secure facility. In committing appellant, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a holding company, obtained an $ 11 million judgment against defendants, a couple who ran an investment company, for securities fraud, and initiated proceedings to collect the judgment. In 2004, the Superior Court of King County, Washington, held the couple in contempt for disobeying multiple orders to deliver assets. The trial court gave the couple four months to deliver monies, or be jailed for contempt. The couple appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had also ruled that a trust created by the husband's father had lost its character as a spendthrift trust, and ordered execution on the trust assets. The couple also appealed that order. On appeal, the couple claimed that imprisonment as a contempt sanction was unconstitutional. They further claimed the order violated due process because they did not have the present ability to purge the contempt. The appellate court found that although there was evidence to support the court's finding that the couple were contumacious, the trial court failed to make a finding that they had a present ability to pay the purge amount. Instead, the trial court found they had, in 2002, possessed $ 635,000, and had &quot;transferred the money away.&quot; That was not a finding that at the time of the contempt order in 2004, they could purge the contempt. Therefore, a reversal was in order because without said finding, the contempt was not coercive (to enforce compliance with a court order and allowed under the Washington Constitution), but impermissibly penal (disallowed under the Washington Constitution). However, the appellate court agreed that the trust had lost its protected character.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the order of execution on the spendthrift trust because the trust had lost its protected character. The appellate court held the contempt order did not violate the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt. But it reversed the contempt order, because the contemnor had to hold the keys to his release, and the trial court made no finding that the couple had the present ability to pay the purge amount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of King County (Washington) that affirmed a decision of the Board of Industrial Appeals (BIA) that found the claimant had fraudulently induced respondent Labor Department to pay widow's benefits under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.32.050(2) of the Industrial Insurance Act (IIA) and that directed her to repay the benefits with penalties pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.32.240(5) (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant received benefits under the IIA as the widow of the decedent, but was later ordered to repay the benefits on the ground they were fraudulently induced because her marriage to the decedent was void since she never divorced her prior husband. The BIA and the trial court affirmed the Department's orders. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting the affidavit of the claimant's husband because it was admissible under the family history hearsay exception, Wash. R. Evid. 804(b)(4). The court also held that the BIA had jurisdiction to determine the claimant's eligibility under the IIA because the BIA's determination pertained to benefit eligibility and not the validity of the claimant's marriage. The court found that the Department was not barred from challenging the claimant's eligibility under the doctrine of res judicata and that the Department had proven the elements of fraud because the Department presented evidence to show that the claimant's divorce petition had been dismissed, and that she knew she was still married to her prior husband, which prevented her from legally marrying the decedent.</SPAN></P>

Both challenged his commitment as an SVP. The court affirmed the dismissal of the habeas corpus petition and dismissed the PRP, stating that he failed to carry the burden placed on habeas and personal restraint petitioners. Further, there was no requirement of a response in 30 days for habeas corpus petitions. The 30-day rule of Wash. R. App. P. 16.9 did not apply to petitions filed in superior court, Wash. R. App. P. 16.3(b). In addition, his SVP hearing met the process of due process and his bare, unsupported, and conclusory allegations failed to show actual and substantial prejudice arising from constitutional error or non-constitutional error resulting in a complete miscarriage of justice. The fact that the State argued that he was not insane in his criminal trial did not preclude it from arguing that he had a mental abnormality because insanity and mental abnormality were not equivalent, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.12.010. Rather, they required very different proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate pled guilty to first-degree assault while armed with a firearm. Five years later, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus seeking to withdraw his plea, arguing that the plea was equivocal and lacked a factual basis, and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. On appeal, he challenged the superior court's decision to deny his petition. In his brief, the inmate failed to discuss the one-year limitation on collateral attacks to criminal convictions set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090, or to reconfigure his arguments to fit within the exceptions to the provision. Thus, the court affirmed the order denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Further, far from being equivocal, the inmate's written statement described his conduct and expressly waived any claim of self-defense, except for purposes of sentencing. The inmate stated that he believed that he was acting in self-defense, but there was no indication that he also believed that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the charged crime.</SPAN></P>

The employee appealed, asserting an unconstitutional taking of his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Specifically, the employee argued that because the insurer recovered all industrial insurance benefits it had paid him, the Department unconstitutionally took his property when it allowed the insurer to offset his potential future industrial insurance benefits against his statutorily defined excess recovery. The appellate court noted the employee received an undifferentiated settlement award for which it was impossible to determine from the record what portion was attributable to general damages, such as pain and suffering, and what portion was attributable to special damages, for which the insurer had already paid the employee industrial insurance benefits or might have to pay as future benefits arising from the same neck injury. The appellate court held that under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.24.060(1)(e) and (2), the insurer was entitled to a lien on the entire remainder of the employee's excess recovery from the third-party-tortfeasor settlement because the parties failed to differentiate general damages from special damages. The appellate court also held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.24.060 was constitutional and that application did not result in a taking of the employee's property.</SPAN></P>

Trial counsel's questioning suggested that the victim implicated defendant in the shooting because he feared retribution from the true shooter. Trial counsel also appropriately and successfully challenged the admission of evidence before and during trial. Also, defendant failed to show that the trial court erred when it found him to be a persistent offender and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The State conceded that the condition was improperly applied to defendant's conduct in that instance, and the court accepted the concession. The term &quot;pornography&quot; was unconstitutionally vague because it was not defined with sufficient definiteness such that ordinary people could understand what it encompassed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions, and the court reversed his driving while license suspended conviction because his driver's license was suspended for the failure to comply with a traffic citation pursuant to Wash.

Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 46.20.289 and 46.20.324(1), were not flagrantly unconstitutional and therefore provided probable cause for his arrest. Defendant also failed to show that a motion to suppress based on the trooper's failure to exercise the discretion by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.64.015 would have been successful, and his ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed. The credibility of his wife's testimony was a question for the jury and the State produced significant evidence to prove that defendant possessed the drug evidence found in his car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for possession of methamphetamine, but the court affirmed, stating that community custody in Washington was equivalent to parole. A person presently on community custody, placement, or supervision had a privacy interest that was diminished rather than absolute and, by the same token, a liberty interest that was conditional rather than absolute. Thus, the court rejected his constitutional challenge against Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.740(1) pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Further, the entry into his home was lawful because that was the first time the officers were at defendant's house and they had no reason to believe that he would not be at home. They reasonably suspected that he was in the apartment. Defendant did not show that he failed to act knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently when he agreed to a stipulated facts trial, or that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance. In addition, the record did not show that his speedy trial rights were violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Superior Court of Snohomish County, Washington, for first-degree unlawful possession of a firearm. He moved to suppress evidence of a gun found during the search, arguing that the initial stop was unconstitutional. The trial court granted the motion, and the case was dismissed. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer ran a registration check on a vehicle and determined that the vehicle's owner, defendant, had a suspended license. The officer saw that two people were in the car, but could not determine the driver's gender. The officer stopped the car and saw both occupants make furtive movements consistent with putting on their seat belts. As the officer approached the car, she noticed that the driver was a female and the passenger was a male. The driver was arrested on an outstanding warrant and defendant was arrested after the driver indicated that he had a weapon in the vehicle. The trial court suppressed the weapon on the basis that the officer did not have an articulable suspicion because she did not attempt to ascertain the physical characteristics of the driver and compare them with the information known about the registered owner of the vehicle. The appellate court held that the occupant's movements consistent with putting on seat belts provided for a substantial likelihood that wrongful activity occurred and was sufficient to justify further inquiry under an investigatory stop and that the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence obtained in the subsequent search.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Franklin County, Washington, granted summary judgment to appellee city where it successfully enforced City of Pasco, Wash., Ordinance 3231 against appellant landlords, intervenor tenants, and intervenor corporation. The ordinance required residential landlords to obtain a business license conditioned upon presenting an inspection certificate showing compliance with health and safety standards. The landlords appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords argued that the trial court erred in concluding that the ordinance did not violate search or privacy principles established in the Fourth Amendment or Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and granting summary judgment dismissal of those claims. Since the city's ordinance required a landlord to provide a certificate of inspection and did not authorize the city to search for code violations, the landlords had to prove governmental action by showing that the landlord was a state actor. The appellate court found that they failed because their authority concerned actions by a city building inspector and school officials, government employees acting within the scope of their employment. The landlords' preexisting private inspection right was consonant with the ordinance's regulatory goals. The landlords had the legal means to gain entry under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 59.18.150. The ordinance was not so vague that it could not be understood by an ordinary person. The appellate court focused on the facts and found that appalling dwelling conditions were well supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motorcycle association sued defendants, state agencies and environmental groups, and claimed that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.09.170, which authorized expenditures of state motor vehicle license and fuel tax revenues on recreational trails that could not be used by motorized vehicles violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 40. The Superior Court of Kittitas County, Washington, dismissed the association's suit, and the association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.09.170 provided that at least annually the state treasurer had to &quot;refund&quot; one percent of the gasoline tax revenues for use in off-road vehicle (ORV) and nonhighway projects, including recreation facilities. The association claimed that &sect; 46.09.170 violated Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 40 because refunds authorized by article II, &sect; 40 did not justify use of funds from the gasoline excise tax to finance construction and maintenance of nonmotorized recreation trails and facilities. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's summary dismissal of the association's claim. The appellate court noted that the framers' intent in drafting art. II, &sect; 40 was to return the share of those taxes paid by drivers who expended fuel driving on roadways other than public highways, roads, and streets. Thus, the refund was paradoxically a &quot;highway purpose&quot; for taxes levied on nonhighway driving. The legislature's dispersal of the refund came within its plenary powers of taxation, and the court found nothing in art. II, &sect; 40 that prohibited the legislature from dispersing the funds as it saw fit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary dismissal of the association's claim was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant on three counts of rape in the first degree and he appealed. The court affirmed however, stating that the trial court did not err in denying his motion to suppress DNA evidence and did not abuse its discretion in excluding other suspect evidence. Further, the determination of whether multiple serious violent offenses were &quot;separate and distinct&quot; criminal conduct under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.589(1)(b) was not a decision that had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and decided by a jury. Thus, the court affirmed the trial court's decision that the three convictions for rape in the first degree were &quot;separate and distinct&quot; conduct under &sect; 9.94A.589(1)(b). But, based on the State's concession that the victim penalty assessment should have been $ 100 rather than $ 500, the court remanded to correct the judgment and sentence accordingly. The court further stated that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.43.754 was not unconstitutional because a previous version of the statute was held not to violate the Fourth Amendment and those case law determinations were persuasive and controlling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant took photographs of his 16-year-old girlfriend's breasts and genitals and showed them to friends. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the convictions violated his First Amendment rights because the photographs did not show the girlfriend engaging in any sexual conduct or performing any sexual activity. The court of appeals disagreed. The photographs showed the actual exhibition of the girlfriend's genitals, unclothed pubic areas, and breasts. A reasonable trier of fact could have inferred that the photos were taken for the purpose of sexually stimulating the viewer. The photos showed the girlfriend engaged in sexual conduct and therefore constituted child pornography. In addition, it was not constitutionally necessary for prosecution under child pornography statutes that defendant knew the actual age of the person depicted. Thus, the statutes were not overly broad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acting under the Washington Shoreline Management Act of 1971 (SMA), appellant city adopted a Shoreline Management Master Program (SMP), and ultimately placed restrictions on applications for new overwater construction and new shoreline armoring to preserve shoreline habitat. Respondents, a citizens group contested the SMP. The Superior Court of Kitsap County, Washington, granted summary judgment for the citizen's group. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the city first contended that two of the citizens, (a building company and a homebuilders association), lacked standing. However, the appellate court found that the latter two parties had interests within the ordinance ambit because the subject moratorium controlled said parties' island-based business opportunities. Thus, said parties did have standing. In addition, one of those parties had standing under Washington's &quot;association&quot; three-prong test. Secondly, the appellate court rejected the city's argument that the trial court erred in deciding it had no express or implied authority to impose the moratorium and that the moratorium conflicted with the state's general laws in violation of the Washington Constitution. In that respect, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70A.390 was limited to growth management in selected counties and cities; it did not apply to shoreline management. Thus, neither Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70A.390 nor Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35A.63.220 granted a city the authority to enact shoreline management regulations under the Washington Shoreline Management Act of 1971. Finally, the Washington Growth Management Act (GMA) did not apply to shoreline development.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Thurston County, Washington, convicting him of failing to register as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had two convictions that required sex offender registration under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130, and registered as a sex offender in Shelton, Mason County. Police dispatch received an anonymous tip that defendant did not live in Shelton, but rather lived with his girlfriend in Tenino, Thurston County. Defendant testified that during the relevant period, he lived in his Shelton trailer but that he cooked, received his mail, and did his laundry at his mother's house. Defendant stated that sometimes he stayed at his mother's house and that he stayed at the girlfriend's home approximately 10 times. Defendant agreed that he had not registered any change of address with the authorities. Defendant argued that the information charging him with failure to register as a sex offender failed to include all the offense elements, and the State conceded error. Also, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130 was not unconstitutionally vague. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130 limited the registration requirements to instances where a convicted sex offender changed residences, and this requirement did not apply when a sex offender merely &quot;sleeps over.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington), which convicted him of 18 charges that included second degree rape under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.050(1)(b), third degree rape under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.060(1)(a), sexual exploitation of a minor, voyeurism, and furnishing liquor to a minor. Defendant also appealed his exceptional sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of the second degree rape charges stemmed from charges that defendant provided alcohol to a minor, victim number one, had intercourse with her, and videotaped it. There was testimony and charges of similar incidents involving different victims. The court held that (1) the information was insufficient to demonstrate that the informants had a basis of knowledge that a videotape existed in that defendant told the informants about it, and the affidavit used to obtain the search warrant for defendant's residence contained no facts showing how a detached magistrate could have concluded that each level of hearsay was reliable; (2) while there was probable cause to search for evidence of rape, the videotapes and camera did not fall under the plain view doctrine because they did not give probable cause to believe that they were evidence of a crime; (3) defendant invited the jury to consider the possibility of date-rape drugs; (4) sufficient evidence existed to support both the convictions of second degree rape and third degree rape; and (5) nothing in the language of the instructions defining second and third degree rape suggested that the jury should assume that a crime was committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the convictions as to second degree rape, sexual exploitation of a minor, sexual motivation, and voyeurism involving victim number one. The court affirmed as to all other counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of King County (Washington) of felony harassment in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020(2)(b), (ii). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant told a woman that he was going to kill a police officer, his wife, and his children. Defendant was convicted of felony harassment and the court affirmed. The trial court's instruction defining a true threat tracked the definition approved in case law. It informed the jury of the applicable law and was not misleading. The trial court properly admitted evidence that defendant was angry about an officer's treatment of defendant during a prior arrest because it showed defendant's motive for making the threat against the officer. The fact that defendant harbored anger toward the officer was relevant because it made the existence of a material fact, whether defendant actually made the threat, more likely. Assuming the evidence of prior bad acts that the trial court agreed to admit was prejudicial to defendant, the court found no abuse of discretion. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020(1)(b), the State had to prove that defendant's words or actions placed the person threatened in reasonable fear of the threat, and the court rejected defendant's claim that the information learned after the officer perceived the threat could not have contributed to the reasonableness of his fear.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners contended the search warrants issued by the district court violated their rights under the Fourth Amendment and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, because the district court did not have jurisdiction to issue search warrants for city code violations. The instant court concluded the district court had authority to issue the search warrants to search the owners' property. The search warrants were issued on probable cause for alleged criminal violations of the city's code, and the district court had jurisdiction for criminal violations of the city's code under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 3.66.060. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the owners' request to supplement the record with new evidence to challenge an interlocal agreement between the city and the county for court services. The owners did not challenge the validity of the interlocal agreement before the hearing examiner and provided no explanation as to why the evidence could not have been discovered and the argument made earlier. The hearing examiner correctly decided he did not have authority to rule on the constitutional validity of the criminal search warrants in this code enforcement proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Licensing failed to provide the individual a hearing before the revocation of his driver's license took effect, even though he timely requested one. The court held that the failure to do so was a violation of his statutory right to due process. The Department offered a hearing more than four months after the license revocation went into effect. Because a belated hearing was not an adequate remedy at law, the trial court should have granted the individual's request for a writ of review and dismissed the revocation. The Department's failure to offer the individual a hearing until after the revocation of his license conflicted with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.329. And, the Department, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.308, counted the 30-day deadline for requesting hearing from the date of arrest, rather than the date the individual received notice of his right to a hearing. That error deprived him from obtaining a hearing before his license was revoked, and therefore, it came within the class of errors that violated due process.</SPAN></P>
