<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate filed a tort action against the Department of Corrections (DOC). After the DOC rejected an offer to settle, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the inmate. The trial court ordered the DOC to pay the inmate's attorney fees, 40% of his total recovery, postjudgment interest, and litigation fees pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-68(b)(2). The Court of Appeals (Georgia) affirmed. The DOC appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate brought an action against the DOC after he was injured when he fell while painting the warden's house. On appeal, the DOC argued that sovereign immunity protected it against the award of attorney fees and that, even in such an award was permissible, the trial court erred in calculating it. The supreme court held that the sovereign immunity of the DOC was waived as to the attorney fees and litigation expenses award under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-68(b). However, the trial court erred in calculating the award based solely, as far as the record reflected, on the contingency agreement rather than on evidence of hours, rates, or other indications regarding the value of the attorneys' professional services actually rendered. In addition, the supreme court noted that the inmate was not entitled to recover all his attorney fees, but only reasonable attorney's fees and expenses of litigation from the date of the rejection of the offer of settlement through the entry of judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals judgment affirming the calculation of attorney fees was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for recalculation. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was arrested on charges of aggravated sexual battery and other claims with regard to actions taken against another student. A reasonable investigation would have revealed that the accusations against the student were demonstrably false. The Court of Appeals examined the definition of state officer or employee in O.C.G.A. &sect; 50-21-22(7) and concluded that the police officers were entitled to immunity under the GTCA and that the student's tort lawsuit against them should, therefore, be dismissed. The Court found error after considering the GTCA as a whole, rather than only its definitions section. The Court held that because it was clear that the officers were not acting for any state government entity when they committed the alleged torts, they were not immune from suit.</SPAN></P>

As such, the case required remand.

The State had charged the facility operator with violations of a county ordinance and the failure to comply with a consent order requiring it to pay $ 25,000 to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in compromise and settlement of various disputed violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facility operator filed a plea in bar of prosecution, raising double jeopardy, a preemption challenge, and a constitutional challenge asserting the ordinance was void for vagueness. The trial court denied the facility operator's plea, specifically concluding that there was no Georgia authority that permitted a corporation to assert Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, double jeopardy protection. The Court held that the trial court erred by finding that a corporation could not assert the Fifth Amendment. The Court noted that it had previously declared that because a corporation is a person pursuant to Georgia law, it is entitled to due process and equal protection from the State. Thus, the Court held that a corporation was entitled to the double jeopardy protection afforded by Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. XVIII. Despite that finding, the Court upheld the denial of the facility operator's plea in bar because the consent order did not amount to criminal punishment to which double jeopardy prohibitions applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-wife, who no longer resided in Georgia, contended that it would be unconstitutional to subject her to the jurisdiction of a Georgia court because she lacked contacts with Georgia and did nothing to avail herself of the laws of Georgia. The supreme court concluded that the trial court erred by dismissing the case based on lack of personal jurisdiction. Although the ex-wife may not have set foot in Georgia for several years, she received child support and maintained custody of her child pursuant to a decree of a Georgia court. In addition, the original decree was entered by a Georgia court with personal jurisdiction over the parties and, under the doctrine of continuing jurisdiction, the Georgia courts maintained jurisdiction on all subsequent proceedings arising out of the original cause of action. Since the original decree was entered in Georgia and the ex-husband, who was seeking modification and enforcement, continued to reside in Georgia, under the plain terms of O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-91(6), the ex-wife was amenable to the jurisdiction of Georgia courts and the Constitution did not forbid the exercise of such jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant did not waive his challenge to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-10-23 by pleading guilty. He made the challenge prior to the entry of his pleas and expressly attempted to reserve it following his pleas. Moreover, the gravamen of the challenge was that the statute failed to adequately give notice that his conduct was criminal, and a plea of guilty did not waive the defense that the indictment charged no crime. The court held that the statute was explicit in its application to impersonation of a &quot;public officer or employee.&quot; If the reach did not extend to impersonation of public employees, then the express use of the word &quot;employee&quot; was mere surplusage.

The trial court did not err by admitting evidence of threats received by a witness and failing to grant a mistrial after the evidence was introduced, as the evidence of threats, which the prosecutor did not connect to defendant, was admissible to explain the witness's reluctance on the witness stand. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter, as there was no evidence of irresistible passion of provocation or any factual basis to support a finding of voluntary manslaughter given that defendant shot into an unsuspecting crowd of strangers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners brought suit against defendants, their homeowners' association (HA) and the county, seeking repairs to stormwater facilities. The HA filed a declaratory judgment action against the county seeking a ruling that an ordinance was unconstitutional. The cases were consolidated; the trial court (Georgia) denied the homeowners' and the HA's summary judgment motions, but granted the county's summary judgment motion. The HA appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subdivision covenants were recorded in 1987; they provided that each homeowner was to maintain and repair the structures on his own property, including any stormwater facilities. In 2004, the county amended its stormwater ordinance to provide that homeowners associations were to take responsibility for stormwater management facilities on their property. The subdivision's stormwater facilities pipes failed, resulting in flooding and sinkholes on the owners' property and elsewhere. The court held that a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 13-3-44(a), the HA was estopped from enforcing the maintenance provision of the covenants against the owners because the HA had repeatedly taken the position that responsibility for upkeep of the facilities rested with the county. The county's ordinance did not apply to the subdivision because its language applied only to new developments and redevelopments, not pre-existing developments.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county school board was under an imminent threat of losing its accreditation. The district court denied preliminary injunctive relief to plaintiff, finding that he failed to show a substantial likelihood that he would prevail on his claim that the statute violated the United States Constitution. As to the Georgia Constitution, the district court certified the question to the Court, asking whether O.C.G.A. &sect; 20-2-73, or any portion thereof, violated the Georgia Constitution. The Court addressed the legislative power of the Georgia General Assembly, due process considerations, separation of power issues, and the history of the legislative power for the removal of local constitutional officers. The Court held that whether characterized as setting a qualification for continued service on the local board in the extraordinary circumstance of an imminent loss of accreditation, or whether it is characterized as providing for removal for malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office, O.C.G.A. &sect; 20-2-73 was a permissible exercise of the legislative power to provide for the removal for cause of members of local boards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a technical college system and a manufacturing facility, challenged the judgment of a Georgia trial court, which denied their motions to dismiss and held that the Open Records Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 50-18-72(a)(47), could not be constitutionally applied to the suit. Appellee workers had filed suit seeking to inspect certain records concerning the hiring practices of the manufacturing facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the manufacturing facility opened, the technical college system undertook to provide technical and vocational training as part of its Quick Start program to the workers whom the manufacturing facility hired. Years later, the workers submitted a request to the technical college system, pursuant to the Open Records Act, seeking to inspect certain records concerning the manufacturing facility's hiring practices. In 2012, while the lawsuit was pending, the Georgia General Assembly amended the Open Records Act and added O.C.G.A. &sect; 50-18-72(a)(47), which excepts certain records concerning the Quick Start program from public inspection. The Court held that the statutory exception in &sect; 50-18-72(a)(47) constitutionally could be applied retroactively to the case. However, the court found that the trial court did not determine that every record requested was excepted from public inspection under &sect; 50-18-72(a)(47). Thus, the case required a remand for the trial court to determine the extent to which the requested records were so excepted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The applicant filed a complaint for mandamus in superior court (Georgia), alleging the denial violated the state statute and his constitutional right to keep and bear arms. The superior court denied mandamus, and the applicant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant alleged that he was entitled to a weapons carry license on the grounds that he was a law-abiding citizen and met all the requirements of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-11-129; alternatively, he alleged that the denial of the license violated his right to keep and bear arms under U.S. Const. amend. II and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, par. VIII. The court rejected his contention that because adjudication was withheld under Florida law, he would have been entitled to first offender treatment under Georgia law, and not disqualified, because the first offender provision in subsection (b)(3) was limited to convictions of specified controlled substance offenses. Given the applicant's criminal history and the fact that he retained the right to possess a handgun in his own home, vehicle, or business under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-11-126, intermediate scrutiny was applied. The goal of &sect; 16-11-129, to protect the safety of individuals in public places, was a substantial government interest. It was not unconstitutional as applied to the applicant, who had pleaded nolo contendre to violent felonies in Florida nearly 20 years earlier.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To the extent the solicitation of sodomy statute in O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-15 could be narrowly construed to only punish speech soliciting sodomy that was not protected by the Georgia Constitution's right to privacy, the solicitation of sodomy statute was constitutional. Although defendant clearly invited the 17-year-old boy to engage in sexual acts falling within the express language of the sodomy statute, the evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of solicitation of sodomy as he never suggested that any encounter occur in a public place; the mere fact that defendant was a public officer did not render public his offer to engage in sex in a private residence; there was never any suggestion that money or anything of commercial value would be exchanged in connection with the encounter; defendant's conduct did not rise to the level of intimidation or coercion that would give rise to a finding of sexual contact by force; and both parties were legally capable of consenting to sexual contact. Because the evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of solicitation of sodomy, his convictions for violation of his oath of office were not supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had reached an impasse in their negotiations for renewing the LOST certificates that authorized them to collect and distribute the tax. The county filed its motion to dismiss the petition, raising various constitutional challenges to the 2010 amendment to O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-8-89(d)(4) and its process for submitting the distribution dispute for judicial resolution. The Court held that to the extent the 2010 amendment to LOST, &sect; 48-8-89(d)(4), permitted judicial resolution of the issue of whether LOST should be renewed and the governing bodies of the special district should be required to levy and collect the tax, the amendment violated the separation of powers doctrine of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; II, para. III. The Court noted that it was not invalidating the tax and not striking the LOST Act or its terms for how the tax may be levied or for what purposes the proceeds may be applied. Rather, the Court struck only the 2010 amendment, &sect; 48-8-89(d)(4), which effectively granted judicial resolution of the allocation and distribution of tax proceeds, a process that the Court deemed to be a clear violation of the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed, finding that &sect; 20-2-690.1, clearly punished the unjustified failure to send a child to school for whom one is responsible to school. The supreme court also concluded that &sect; 20-2-690.1 did not violate equal protection, as defendant failed to show any potential variation in application of the statute without a rational basis and the statute was reasonably related to the legitimate governmental interest of ensuring that children residing in Georgia are afforded the opportunity of an eduction. Finally, the supreme court concluded that &sect; 20-2-690.1 did not unconstitutionally delegate power to the General Assembly, as the delegation was permissible and was accompanied by sufficient guidelines, that directed the State Board of Education, in promulgating policies and regulations, to take into consideration sickness and other emergencies that may arise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-8-76.1(d), which deals with the use of safety belts in passenger vehicles, is unconstitutional. However, because the trial court never ruled on the constitutionality of &sect; 40-8-76.1(d) below, defendant presented nothing for the supreme court to review on appeal. Defendant further argued that Georgia's hit and run statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-270(a), is unconstitutional, because the statutory requirements that one must stop at the scene of an accident and identify oneself violated a person's right against self-incrimination under both the U.S. and the Georgia Constitutions. The supreme court disagreed, noting that Georgia's hit-and run statute does not confront an individual with substantial hazards of self-incrimination through requiring certain disclosures, as the statute was not directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of nine counts of felony theft by deception and one count of misdemeanor theft by deception. The court sentenced defendant as a recidivist under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-7(a) and (c), to a total of 25 years of confinement followed by 25 years on probation. The trial court denied defendant's motion for a new trial. The Court of Appeals (Georgia) affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the court of appeals erred by holding that a felony conviction for theft by deception based on a defendant's failure to fully perform services as promised could stand absent proof of the value of the work actually performed by defendant. The supreme court concluded that the court of appeal did err and held that where a defendant is charged under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-8-3(a) and (b)(5) for deceitfully promising to perform services, the State must prove the value of any services performed in order to prove that defendant intended to ultimately deprive the victim of property. The supreme court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to sustain felony convictions under &sect; 16-8-3(a) and (b)(5) on three of the counts, but insufficient to sustain even a misdemeanor conviction on one of the counts. As to that one count, the State did not present evidence at trial from which the jury could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intentionally and ultimately deprived the alleged victim of any amount of property, because the State did not demonstrate that the services defendant actually provided were worth less than the amount he was paid under the contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a county board of commissioners (board), appealed the judgment of a Georgia trial court, which on remand set aside the decision of the board to abandon a road under O.C.G.A. &sect; 32-7-2(b)(1). Plaintiff challengers had brought mandamus and attorney fees claims against the board challenging the abandonment decision. The Court had jurisdiction over the case pursuant to Ga. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held a bench trial on plaintiffs' mandamus and attorney fees claims and entered an order concluding that the board's decision to abandon the road was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion and was not in the best public interest; the trial court, therefore, set aside the abandonment decision. The court also ruled that the county had purchased an adjacent lot with no particular public purpose and in bad faith to influence the outcome of the mandamus action; on that ground, the trial court awarded plaintiffs $ 26,323.07 in attorney fees under O.C.G.A. &sect; 13-6-11. The trial court also entered an order of mandamus requiring the board to repair and maintain the road. The Court found error, concluding that the trial court failed to accord proper deference to the board's decision to abandon the road and substituted its own judgment for that of the board. As a result, the Court reversed the order setting aside the board's abandonment decision, along with the mandamus and attorney fees award that were predicated on the abandonment ruling. The Court noted that since plaintiffs were no longer the prevailing parties, the award of attorney fees had to be vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court reversed the judgment setting aside the board's abandonment decision and vacated the award of attorney fees to plaintiffs. The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his plea in abatement, as the doctrine of collateral estoppel precluded the State from prosecuting him for Medicaid fraud because the ultimate issue in the criminal prosecution, whether he knowingly and wilfully accepted medical assistance payments to which he was not entitled, was decided adversely to the State in the earlier administrative proceeding. The supreme court disagreed, finding that the State did not have a full opportunity to litigate the issues before the administrative law judge, as the only purpose of the administrative hearing was to determine whether the Georgia Department of Community Health withhold on defendant's Medicaid reimbursements would continue during the pendency of the investigation. The supreme court also concluded that O.C.G.A. &sect; 49-4-146.1(b)(2), as applied, was not unconstitutionally vague. The procedures for which one would not be entitled to payment through the program were listed in the Medicaid manual, which, in conjunction with the statute, provided defendant with appropriate notice as required by law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds filed an action against an insurer for uninsured motorist benefits under an umbrella policy. The insurer removed the case to District Court, which certified two questions to the supreme court: Do the offer/rejection requirements of the Georgia Uninsured Motorist Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 33-7-11, apply umbrella policies renewed on or after January 1, 2009?

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds renewed their umbrella policy after O.C.G.A. &sect; 33-7-11 was amended so as to exempt umbrella policies the mandatory uninsured motorist coverage requirements. After one of the insureds was injured in an automobile accident and sought uninsured motorist benefits under the policy, the insurer disputed coverage, contending that the insureds no longer had such coverage. The insured contended that it would be unconstitutional to apply the subject amendment to the renewal of their policy, originally issued before the adoption of the amendment and into which uninsured motorist coverage previously had been implied by operation of law. The supreme court concluded that the amendment of &sect; 33-7-11 worked no impairment of vested contractual rights, as it merely relieved the insurer from mandatory coverage, leaving the parties free to negotiate the terms of the renewals. Given that &sect; 33-7-11(a)(3) excluded umbrella policies from the requirement to offer uninsured motorist coverage, the supreme court concluded it would be nonsensical to require an insurer to provide an insured with notice of the types of uninsured motorist coverage options that the insurer was not obligated to provide.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found no error, concluding that the assurances made to defendant, that he could go home if he told the truth and that the investigators had no intention of charging defendant, did not amount to a &quot;hope of benefit&quot; rendering the statements involuntary. Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred when it refused to strike for cause a prospective juror who said he could not consider the possibility of parole for someone convicted of murder if the murder involved the sexual abuse of a child. The supreme court found no error, noting that the juror said a great deal more, including that he could consider both life imprisonment and the death penalty, and that he could consider both life with and without the possibility parole, depending on the facts presented at trial. Thus, the trial court did to err in finding the juror qualified. Defendant's challenge to the State's use of peremptory strikes on the basis of race failed, as the State presented nondiscriminatory reasons for striking each of the five jurors at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence failed, as the evidence showed that, while two of the victim's children were in a closet, defendant shot the victim and told the children the victim shot herself.

While there was ample evidence to support defendant's convictions for malice murder and aggravated assault with a handgun, the assault conviction had to be vacated because the offenses required proof of the same elements. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to strike a juror for cause after the juror indicated that the fact that members of her family had been victims of domestic violence and her college roommate's father had been murdered might make it hard to fair and impartial, as the prospective juror stated she would strive to be impartial.

Appellant's suit alleged that school taxes had been illegally diverted. The case had been transferred to the Court pursuant to its constitutional jurisdiction under Ga. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant asserted that school taxes had been illegally diverted to the development authority to fund a city's tax allocation districts (TADs). The complaint sought class certification and injunctive relief barring the school system from disbursing school taxes previously levied in conjunction with the TADs. The Court held that under the law when it decided Woodham in February 2008, the local government approvals for the TADs would have been ruled unconstitutional to the same extent that the Court held that the proposed funding for the bonds was unconstitutional; at that time, local school taxes could not be used for general redevelopment purposes. However, because a 2008 Amendment to Ga. Const. art. IX, &sect; II, para. VII(b) and O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-44-9(g), governing TADs, changed the applicable law, and those changes were expressly made retroactive with respect to the county, city, and local board of education approvals needed to use school taxes for redevelopment purposes, appellees were properly granted summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant borrower challenged the judgment of a Georgia trial court, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee lender. The lender brought a mortgage foreclosure suit against the borrower after the borrower defaulted on a promissory note and deed to secure the debt. The Court had jurisdiction in the case because the borrower was challenging the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 13-1-11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was undisputed that the borrower defaulted on the loan in the principal amount of $ 1.62 million to finance the purchase of a home. The borrower's main contention on appeal was that the lender was not entitled to summary judgment for damages because it failed to comply with certain conditions precedent to its right to bring a collection action. The Court disagreed and held that the borrower failed to cure the payment default after receiving timely notice of said default, thus, the loan documents provided the lender the right to accelerate and file suit to collect all amounts owed. The Court further held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 13-1-11 bore a rational relation to the purpose for which the statute was intended, namely to provide debtors with the opportunity to avoid the contractual obligation to pay the creditor's attorney fees by allowing the debtor a last chance to pay the balance of the debt and avoid litigation. The Court held that the application of &sect; 13-1-11 to arrive at the amount of the award of attorney fees was neither punitive nor violative of the borrower's due process rights nor was the award contrary to the intent of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Intervenor association appealed the trial court's decisions to continue a statewide injunction, and defendant, the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) appealed various rulings that the take-down credits under the statute violated the Georgia Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">O.C.G.A. &sect; 32-6-75.3 allowed vegetation, including trees, to be removed in order to facilitate billboard advertising under specific circumstances and with remuneration to the State of Georgia for removed trees. The Court noted that it had previously upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 32-6-75.3 and rejected the city's challenges. As to the association's appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by continuing a statewide injunction prohibiting the issuance of vegetation management permits until it could obtain enough evidence to determine whether the pre-existing beautification project located in the city qualified as a permitted beautification project because the trial court's decision had state-wide implications. As to GDOT's appeal, the Court held that the trial court erred in holding that &sect; 32-6-75.3(j) violated the gratuities clause. To the contrary, the Court held that the Georgia Legislature has explicitly found that removal of outdated signs provides a benefit to the State and that there would be a financial benefit in allowing take-down credits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's rulings in the appeals of the city and the association. The Court reversed the trial court's determination that the take-down credits violated the gratuities clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an undocumented alien, was stopped by a police officer after the officer determined that registration of the van defendant was driving had been suspended. Defendant was unable to produce a valid driver's license and was cited for violating &sect; 40-5-20(a). Defendant claimed that &sect; 40-5-20(a) was unconstitutional as applied to him on several grounds. At the hearing on the motion, the parties stipulated that another statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-21.1, prevented defendant from obtaining even a temporary Georgia driver's license because he was an &quot;undocumented Mexican citizen&quot; and that defendant had been living in Georgia for at least 10 years when the officer cited him. The appellate court found that limiting &sect; 40-5-20 (a)'s safe harbor to the production at trial of a Georgia driver's license was a rational part of the enforcement scheme, allowing the presumption created by a violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-29(b) to be automatically rebutted only where the evidence that the driver in fact had a valid license when cited was most indisputable and readily evaluated by the factfinder. Defendant failed to show that federal law somehow preempted &sect; 40-5-20(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A probate judge denied an application for a weapons carry license (WCL). The applicant sought declaratory and mandamus relief. The Superior Court of Clayton County (Georgia) declared the applicant eligible for a WCL, issued an order compelling the probate judge to issue a WCL, and denied the applicant's request for a declaration that his right to bear arms was violated. The probate judge appealed and the applicant cross appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant had been convicted of felony moonshining in 1971, and received a two-year sentence. The applicant later applied for and received, from the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, an order of restoration of civil and political rights commutation and removing all disabilities resulting from the applicant's sentences. On appeal, the probate judge argued that the trial court erred in ruling that the applicant was entitled to a WCL based on the Board's restoration order. The probate judge's contention was meritless. When the Board restored &quot;all&quot; of the applicant's civil rights and removed &quot;all&quot; disabilities imposed on him by Georgia law, it was apparent that the applicant regained any right to keep and bear arms that he had lost as a result of his felony conviction, and the applicant was not subject to the disabilities to obtain a WCL and possession firearms that otherwise would have applied to him under O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-11-131(b) and 16-11-129. Because the trial court ruled, correctly, that the applicant was entitled to a WCL, the trial court should have dismissed his constitutional claim as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the applicant's request for a declaration that the applicant's right to bear arms was violated was vacated. The judgment of the trial court was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of felony murder and criminal attempt to commit armed robbery, and recommended a death sentence for the murder. The trial court sentenced defendant in accordance with the jury's recommendation and properly merged the criminal attempt to commit armed robbery conviction into the felony murder conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to defendant's claims of error, the supreme court concluded that, inter alia, the evidence supported the jury's finding of the alleged statutory aggravating factor, that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the capital felony of armed robbery, because the jury was authorized to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt from the evidence presented that defendant was engaged in the commission of an armed robbery at the time he murdered the victim. Defendant's due process rights were not violated due to the fact a trial transcript was not completed until approximately four years after the jury returned its sentencing verdict, as defendant did not file his amendment to his motion for a new trial for 11 years after receiving the transcript and thus, failed to show how the delay harmed him. The trial court did not err in refusing to exclude three prospective jurors because they would have automatically imposed the death penalty, as one juror, as one of the juror was excused before jury selection began and the other two, while indicating a leaning toward the death penalty, stated that they would listen to the evidence and fairly consider both sentencing options.</SPAN></P>

Appellees moved to dismiss the action on the ground that appellant failed to raise its constitutional claims before appellees. The trial court agreed and granted the motions to dismiss filed by appellees. The court found error, concluding that the trial court erred by failing to apply the correct analysis for a motion to dismiss. The court also vacated the trial court's denial of the petition for mandamus because on remand, if the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, the resolution of the petition was necessarily premature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued on appeal that the trial court erred in finding that it was not entitled to coverage under the GIIP because the county's net worth exceeded $ 25 million and, thus, was exempt from coverage under the Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 33-36-3(4)(G). The Court held that it had expressly held that the GIIP and the net worth exclusion of &sect; 33-36-3(4)(G) applied to counties as legal entities under the Act. Moreover, the Court held that the language of &sect; 33-36-3(4)(G) was plain and unambiguous. The Court noted that the Act made no distinction or exception for public entities and there was no evidence to suggest that the Georgia legislature intended to exempt a county and those similarly situated from the purview of the Act. Thus, the Court held that the trial court properly applied the exemption provision and granted GIIP summary judgment since the county was not covered by the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the Court for review was the death penalty case of defendant, who was convicted by the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia), of murdering his wife and twin two-year-old sons, following a jury trial. The jury found two statutory aggravating circumstances related to each of the three murders and recommended three death sentences, which the trial court imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court addressed numerous issues raised by defendant on appeal but focused on a voir dire issue. Specifically, the Court held that the trial court abused its discretion in prohibiting defendant from asking prospective jurors in voir dire whether they would consider all three sentencing options, namely, death, life without parole, and life with the possibility of parole, in a case involving the murder of young children, since that was clearly a critical fact in the case. The Court held that the issue was shown to be a critical factor based on, among other things, the responses of prospective jurors who knew or inferred that fact from other sources and by the way the prosecutor tried and argued the case. The Court could not say that the error was harmless. The Court held that the subject matter of the action as to which voir dire is permitted under O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-12-133 extended beyond the crimes charged in the indictment and the sentences the charges carried to other critical facts of the case, with certain limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court reversed, in part, all three of defendant's death sentences and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing. The Court affirmed the jury's findings that two statutory aggravating circumstances existed as to each murder, and indicated that the State was not barred from seeking the death penalty again in a new sentencing trial before a properly qualified jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court held that a declaratory judgment was not an appropriate remedy for challenging evidentiary policies or practices at preliminary hearings. Because the dispute was not a civil case that presented a justiciable controversy and declaratory relief would not provide any more guidance or certainty than current case law, the Court held that declaratory relief was not an appropriate remedy. The Court noted that the case was not a controversy between adverse parties or a civil case in which the ends of justice require a declaration to provide guidance or eliminate uncertainty. Therefore, the Court held that the district attorney does not have the right to bring a declaratory judgment action to obtain review of the probable cause decisions of magistrate judges at preliminary hearings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon appellant's release from a probation detention center, he was required under O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-12 to register with the sheriff of the county in which he resided. He complied with the registration requirements for several years. However, in 2009, he had a dispute with an aunt with whom he was living and moved to another address without notifying the sheriff. On appeal, appellant asserted that &sect; 42-1-12(e)(4), the provision the State alleged required him to register as a sexual offender, was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed and held that &sect; 42-1-12(e)(4) was not unconstitutionally vague absent the definition of the term sexually violent offense. The court found that although the definition of a sexually violent offense present in the former version of &sect; 42-1-12 had not been carried forward into the amended statute,&nbsp;&sect; 42-1-12 as amended similarly defines dangerous sexual offense with respect to convictions occurring on or before June 30, 2006 to include any criminal offense which consists of the same or similar elements of the offense of aggravated sexual battery in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-22.2.

The nightclub operated two nightclubs in the city and received an alcohol license for each club, pursuant to the ordinance. The competitor contended that the nightclub failed to open either club for business within nine months of the issuance of the licenses and, therefore, the automatic forfeiture provision of the ordinance applied. The trial court found that the nightclub produced sufficient evidence that it held private events at each of its clubs within nine months of receiving the alcohol licenses and therefore, denied the petition for a writ of mandamus. The court upheld the trial court's conclusion, finding that a plain interpretation of the ordinance only required that a license holder open for business to avoid forfeiture and did not require that the license holder actually use the license to satisfy the open for business requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court concluded that the habeas court erred by concluding that there was a reasonable probability that trial counsel's deficiencies changed the outcome of his trial and, therefore, erred by granting relief based on the inmate's ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim. Among other things, the supreme court noted that any deficient performance by trial counsel in failing to disclose a psychologist's testimony regarding whether the inmate's lack of emotion at the scene was due to a personality disorder was not significantly prejudicial. The supreme court also found no prejudice in trial counsel's failure to retain an expert with greater expertise in police interrogation tactics and the possibility of false confession, because the question of whether someone might be persuaded to give a false confession through persuasive interrogation techniques is &quot;not beyond the ken of the average juror,&quot; and, therefore, the absence of expert testimony on that question would not be prejudicial. The inmate's cross appeal was properly denied, as, inter alia, the claim the State presented false testimony lacked merit where a 911 recording did not show any trial testimony was false.</SPAN></P>

The state also alleged that the business was an underground commercial gambling establishment as defined by O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-14-3(9)(A)(xvii). The reviewing court found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 5-6-34(a)(4) provided that appeals could be taken from all judgments or orders granting or refusing applications for receivers or for interlocutory or final injunctions. As such, the trial court's order fell into the category of direct appeals allowed pursuant to &sect; 5-6-34 (a) (4) and the case was properly before the court. Since the equitable remedies allowed by O.C.G.A. &sect;16-14-6(a) were available to other aggrieved parties as well as to the state, an action for such remedies was uncharacteristic of a criminal matter.

The issue was whether the jury should consider the fault of the criminal actor in its apportioning its award of damages under O.C.G.A. &sect; 51-12-33, between the defendants, the property owner and the criminal assailant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal court also asked whether, if the jury determined that the property owner negligently failed to prevent a foreseeable criminal attack, should jury instructions or a special verdict form requiring the jury to apportion its award of damages among the property owner and the criminal assailant result in a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights to a jury trial, due process, or equal protection. A majority of the supreme court found that had the Legislature intended to exclude the criminal actor's intentional acts from the apportionment of fault, it would have done so explicitly. Instead, fault should be apportioned. Jury instructions or a special verdict form apportioning the award of damages pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 51-12-33, did not result in a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of cruelty to children in the first degree, aggravated child molestation, and child molestation. He challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Georgia), which affirmed the denial of his motion for new trial. The court of appeals held that the children's out-of-court statements about sexual conduct that happened to each other in their presence were admissible under the Child Hearsay Statute, O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals concluded that the holding in Division 3 of Woodard v. State, 269 Ga. 317 (1998), which struck down O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-16 as a violation of the equal protection of the law, was wrongly decided. The supreme court overruled Woodard, and held that the court of appeals committed no reversible error in declining to extend the holding of that case to the circumstances of defendant's case. There was nothing irrational about creating disparate classes of criminal defendants based on the young age of the witnesses to their crimes. Defendant was convicted of first-degree child cruelty for causing cruel mental pain to the victims, yet he made no claim that O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-70(b) violated equal protection because it did not prohibit the same conduct toward an adult. If it was rational to imprison a defendant who caused a child to witness sexual contact or physical abuse, it was rational to make defendant merely deal with hearsay from such a child. The fact that the General Assembly loosened the hearsay rule for child witnesses to crimes involving only sexual contact and physical abuse would pose no problem under rational basis review.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. III, &sect; VI, para. IV(a), because, once the population requirement was met, a county still met it regardless of population. The supreme court held the statute was not a special law because, when measuring county population by the 1990 census &quot;or any future such census,&quot; &quot;or&quot; created required elasticity by letting counties move into or fall from the class based on the latest census. The probate court could hold jury trials because (1) the census dropping its county's population below that required was not effective until July 1, 2012, and (2) a statutory amendment, effective that date, lowered the requirement. The beneficiary could not claim the niece untimely demanded a jury, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-9-121(a), because (1) the beneficiary did not object in the trial court on the grounds raised on appeal, waiving them, (2) the niece was not a party until she was allowed to intervene, after which she timely demanded a jury, and (3) her motion to intervene was not a &quot;pleading&quot; triggering the jury trial demand deadline.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that the voter was not resident of the county and therefore not an elector qualified to vote in that county.

It held that without a clear connection to a specific election, a challenge to a voter's qualifications brought under O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 21-2-228 or 21-2-229 did not fall within the high court's jurisdiction over &quot;cases of election contest&quot; pursuant to Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; VI, para. II(2). Whatever &quot;election contest&quot; meant, it had to relate to a dispute regarding an election. As the board's challenge involved only the qualifications of an individual voter, not tied to any particular election, the voter's appeal did not fall within the high court's jurisdiction over &quot;cases of election contest.&quot; To the extent that Jarrard v. Clayton County Bd. of Registrars, 425 S.E.2d 874 (1992), was decided as an &quot;election contest,&quot; it was overruled. As there was no other basis for the high court's jurisdiction over the appeal, the matter had to be transferred pursuant to Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; V, para. III.</SPAN></P>

His sentence, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-1(d), was not cruel or unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments, due to the fact that he had just turned 20 when he committed the crimes, because (1) there was no state or federal constitutional prohibition against sentencing a young adult to life in prison without parole for committing a homicide, and (2) there was no objective evidence that Georgians, as a matter of state constitutional law, considered the sentence to be cruel and unusual punishment when applied to an adult defendant who committed a homicide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the trial court (Georgia), which convicted him of malice murder and attempting to elude a police officer in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-395. He argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in charging the jury that under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-3-21(b)(2), a person was not justified in using force if that person was attempting to commit or was committing a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that based on the evidence supporting defendant's participation in a felony drug transaction at the time of the fatal shooting of the victim, the trial court was authorized to instruct the jury pursuant to &sect; 16-3-21(b)(2) that a person was not justified in using force in defense of self or others if he was attempting to commit, committing, or fleeing after the commission or attempted commission of a felony. As opposed to simply minding his own business as a convicted felon, defendant affirmatively chose to engage in the potentially dangerous and violent criminal business of a felony drug deal before the fatal confrontation with the victim took place. The trial court properly sentenced defendant on five separate counts of attempting to elude a police officer. The evidence supported the jury's conclusion that defendant willfully led police on a dangerous high speed chase after being given clear signals by five separate police vehicles to stop. The act of fleeing from an individual police vehicle or police officer after being given a proper signal to stop from that individual vehicle or officer formed the proper unit of prosecution under &sect; 40-6-395.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant, who was indicted for malice murder, felony murder, armed robbery, and theft by taking a motor vehicle, filed a motion in the Superior Court of Peach County (Georgia), for discharge and acquittal under the Georgia speedy trial statute for capital cases, O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-171. The motion was denied. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented was whether, following the defendant's demand for speedy trial, O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-171(b) required only two, or more than two, full terms of court to pass without a trial before the defendant was entitled to discharge and acquittal. The state supreme court found that, under the correct interpretation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-171(b), the defendant was not entitled to be discharged and acquitted until the close of the third term of court after the term in which the defendant filed her demand for a speedy trial. That was when more than two regular terms of court would have convened and adjourned after the term at which the demand for speedy trial was filed. Because the State of Georgia filed its notice of intent to seek the death penalty during the third term, which was before the defendant was entitled to be discharged and acquitted, that notice reset the statutory speedy trial clock, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-171(c), and the trial court therefore correctly denied the defendant's motion as premature.</SPAN></P>

Based on the medical examiner's testimony, a rational jury could conclude that defendant's strangulation of the victim either caused or directly and materially contributed to her death and that the emergency treatment by emergency personnel was at most a secondary, rather than intervening, cause of death. There was no evidence that the medical treatment was negligent. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence of allegedly similar transactions involving defendant's ex-wife. Both the prior transactions and the murder involved violent assaults by defendant against women with whom he was intimately involved. The similar transactions were offered to prove intent, bent of mind, course of conduct, and common scheme or plan. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to present testimony by defendant's ex-girlfriend regarding his character. Trial counsel testified that testimony regarding defendant's peaceful character would have opened the door to additional adverse character evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the trial court (Georgia), which convicted him of aggravated child molestation, aggravated sodomy, and sexual battery against a person under sixteen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the Child Hearsay Statute, as construed in previous cases and as applied in the case, could not pass constitutional muster because it failed to put the onus on the prosecution to put the child victim on the witness stand to confront defendant. Any cases suggesting the contrary were overruled. However, the right of confrontation could be satisfied by construing the statute to require pretrial notice of the State's intent to use a child victim's hearsay statements. The victim's statements to her mother were non-testimonial, whereas her statement to the forensic interviewer, made several weeks after the crimes, was testimonial. Even if the victim's statement to the forensic examiner, and the statements made by the victim and her mother to the police were admitted erroneously, the errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The victim's statement to the forensic interviewer was the same as her statement to her mother. The statements made by the victim and her mother to police were cumulative of the victim's statement to her mother, as well as the mother's testimony and the forensic evidence properly admitted against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The pleaded not guilty and filed motions to dismiss the charges, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional on its face in violation of the free speech clauses of the United States and Georgia Constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. 1 and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that &sect; 16-5-5(b) was unconstitutional under the free speech provisions of the United States and Georgia Constitutions. By its plain language, &sect; 16-5-5(b) proscribed speech based on content in that it restricted anyone who publicly advertised, offered, or held himself or herself out as offering that he or she would intentionally and actively assist another person in the commission of suicide. It was not all assisted suicides that were criminalized but only those that included a public advertisement or offer to assist. The distinction took the statute out of the realm of content neutral regulations and rendered it a selective restraint on speech with a particular content. The State failed to provide any explanation or evidence as to why a public advertisement or offer to assist in an otherwise legal activity was sufficiently problematic to justify an intrusion on protected speech rights. Thus, the State could not, consistent with the United States and Georgia Constitutions, make the public advertisement or offer to assist in a suicide a criminal offense. Both the object and plain language of &sect; 16-5-5(b) made it insusceptible to a limiting construction.</SPAN></P>

At the hospital, he executed the new will excluding the daughter. The daughter visited him later that day. The following day, the father became incoherent, and he died several weeks later. The court held that a neurologist report offered by the daughter was inadmissible under the hearsay exception of O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-18 because it was not in narrative form and relied heavily on unexplained medical terms and abbreviations, includes lab results with minimal interpretation, and failed to set forth an assessment of the patient in story form. As a report prepared for the treating physician, it required an expert analysis to clarify its implications. Witnesses, including the father's attorney, attested that they believed the father signed his will freely and voluntarily, and that he was strong-willed, stubborn, opinionated, and not susceptible to influence.</SPAN></P>

IX, &sect; II, para. I(c)(2) by affecting the composition or form of the Board. It conferred only administrative, rather than executive, authority on the chair of the Board's finance committee. After approval and endorsement, &sect; 2 mandated that all bills be paid by check, which would be signed by at least two of the named officials. 2010 Ga. Laws 4192, 4194, 4198. The use of the word &quot;shall&quot; indicated that the finance chair had a ministerial and mandatory duty, rather than a discretionary duty, to sign the checks. Section 3 did not constitute an action affecting the elective office of Commissioner in violation of Ga. Const. art. IX, &sect; II, para. I(c)(1). It did not, by itself negatively impact on the ability of the Commissioners to carry out their duties. Instead, &sect; 3 gave the Board an additional option, similar to that given by general law to many other county governing authorities, for purchasing goods, property or services.</SPAN></P>

While the deeds that transferred the property at issue to the corporation did not show an intent by the grantors to create a trust, they did not expressly preclude the creation of one. Neutral principles of law, derived from the governing documents adopted by the local and national churches, supported by the policy reflected in O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 14-5-46 to -47, demonstrated that an implied trust in favor of the PCUSA existed on the local church's property to which the corporation held legal title.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of a trial court (Georgia) denying his motion for new trial following his conviction upon a jury's verdict of felony murder and aggravated assault. The trial court merged the aggravated assault conviction into the felony murder conviction and sentenced defendant to life in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sufficient evidence supported the verdict where a witness testified that defendant told him that he sent the victim, defendant's girlfriend, to buy cocaine, that the substance she purchased was not cocaine, that defendant and the victim later confronted the seller, and that defendant shot the victim when she became agitated during the confrontation. After the shooting, defendant and the victim were transported to the hospital. Five years later, the district attorney's office obtained and executed a search warrant authorizing a search of defendant's hospital records. The warrant was constitutional under U.S. Const. amends. IV and V, and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. XIII, and the health information was subject to disclosure under 45 C.F.R. &sect; 164.512(f)(1)(ii)(A), 42 C.F.R. &sect; 2.63(a)(2), and O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-9-40(a). The medical records were relevant and admissible, and the warrant was narrowly drafted to seek only the records related to treatment on the night of the crime. Admitting the records into evidence did not violate the Confrontation Clause of U.S. Const. amend. VI because the records were not testimonial. Finally, defendant's inculpatory statements were voluntarily made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of incest against his stepdaughter and was sentenced to 20 years, with the first ten years to be served in confinement and the balance to be served on probation with a number of special conditions. The Court of Appeals (Georgia) affirmed the conviction but vacated the sentence and remanded the case for resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first question was whether a trial court should give a jury instruction on prior consistent statements. At trial, the court gave a pattern jury instruction on prior consistent statements over defendant's objection. While the instruction should not have been given as a matter of course, it did not harm defendant. The pattern jury instruction did not explicitly direct the jury to place any additional weight on prior consistent statements beyond that which the law already gave them. Furthermore, defendant offered no persuasive argument that the giving of the pattern instruction harmed him. The second question was whether the court of appeals erred in upholding the trial court's amendments to defendant's sentence to include special conditions of probation. Defendant's double jeopardy and due process rights were not violated by the process the trial court followed in imposing the special conditions of probation. The trial court had authority under O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-8-34(g) to modify the probation conditions throughout the period of the sentence. The special conditions of probation did not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute additional punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a trial court (Georgia) of violating a local ordinance regulating the volume of noise from mechanical sound-making devices. Defendant appealed, contending that the provision was facially invalid under the free speech clause of the Georgia Constitution, Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At 3:30 a.m. on a Saturday morning, a county police officer cited defendant for violating Athens-Clarke County, Ga. Ordinance &sect; 3-5-24(c)(2)(a), which prohibited noise from mechanical sound-making devices or from a party that is plainly audible 100 feet away from a person's property limits between midnight and 7:00 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. There were no noise complaints about the party, but the officer was patrolling the area and heard loud music from over 170 feet away. The ordinance served a significant government interest in protecting both the community in general and individual citizens from noises which could have affected their comfort, repose, health, or safety. Further, the provision left open ample alternatives for expression. It never prohibited playing, listening to, or making music or other sounds; it merely limited the volume to a degree according to the time of day and day of the week. Finally, &sect; 3-5-24(c)(2)(a) was the least restrictive means of promoting the County's significant interest in protecting the comfort and repose of its citizens. Accordingly, &sect; 3-5-24(c)(2)(a) did not violate Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. V.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-10-20, when properly construed to require that defendant make the false statement with knowledge and intent that it could come within the jurisdiction of a state or local government agency, was constitutional. The evidence was sufficient to authorize a rational jury to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of violating O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-10-20. Defendant admitted that he knowingly and willfully made the false statement at issue. The evidence was sufficient to prove that he knew and intended that his false statement would come to the attention of a state or local government agency in Georgia that had the power to act on it. The evidence was not sufficient to support defendant's conviction for violating O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-10-94.

Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 18-4-64(a)(2, 3, 6, 7), the creditor was required to notify the in-state judgment debtor by certified mail, ordinary mail or by personal delivery within a prescribed period of time -- three business days of serving the garnishee. The court rejected the trial court's and Court of Appeals' decisions that the creditor's mailing of the notice eight business days after serving the bank substantially complied with the statute pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 1-3-1. No construction of the statute was permitted because it unambiguously required notice within three business days, and the requirement of notice in the garnishment context was of constitutional dimension because it allowed the debtor to intervene under O.C.G.A. &sect; 18-4-93 to protect his property rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant purchaser filed an action against appellees, mortgagors and the holder of a deed to secure the debt on their property, alleging that it was entitled as high bidder to delivery of the deed. It challenged an order of the trial court (Georgia), which granted the mortgagors and holder summary judgment, finding that the holder properly rescinded the foreclosure sale pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-13-172.1 and that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the trial court did not err by upholding the constitutionality of the statute and finding that the holder was authorized to and properly did rescind the sale. O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-13-172.1 authorized under clearly defined circumstances the rescission of an eligible sale. The purchaser completely failed to carry its burden of showing that O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-13-172.1 was unconstitutionally vague in any of its applications. Persons of common intelligence would have no difficulty understanding that O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-13-172.1 in and of itself authorizes rescission of an eligible sale due to the occurrence of the bankruptcy stay in O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-13-172.1(c) or one of the three situations set forth in O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-13-172.1(d).

Where a lender was utilizing O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-13-172.1(d)(3) to rescind a sale of property based upon the borrower's promise to cure the default, any person of common intelligence would understand that the lender and borrower entered into an enforceable agreement.</SPAN></P>

They challenged an order of the Superior Court of DeKalb County (Georgia), which granted the county summary judgment, finding that the IGA was unconstitutional as violative of Ga. Const. art.

The supreme court held that summary judgment was properly granted to the county because the IGA was not a valid intergovernmental contract under the Intergovernmental Contracts Clause of the Georgia Constitution. The focus and clear purpose of the IGA was to provide a formula for the distribution of the HOST revenues. It was a revenue-sharing agreement. The IGA was an agreement about how to divide and distribute HOST revenues between the county and the cities, with the cities agreeing to expend the monies disbursed solely for capital outlay projects to be located within the geographical boundaries of the county and to be owned, operated, or both either by the county, one of more cities or any combination thereof. The IGA could not be deemed an agreement for the provision of authorized &quot;services.&quot; The fact that the IGA required the cities to expend the tax proceeds in accordance with the mandates of the Homestead Option Sales and Use Tax Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-8-102, did not transform it into either a contract for services or one for the use of facilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners bought a house and land. The utility had long ago run utility lines through a wooded area far from the house but had taken them out of service at least 15 years earlier. The owners' title search showed no recorded easements, and they found no evidence of a utility easement during their preclosing physical inspection of the property. Neither the owners nor their immediate predecessors had actual knowledge of the old utility lines. The owners discovered that the utility had entered the property and clear-cut a swath through the forest. The utility later reentered that area and destroyed vegetation by spraying herbicide. On appeal, the court found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 46-3-204 was constitutional. However, summary judgment was inappropriate on the parties' competing easement claims, and the trespass and conversion claims could not be denied on the merits based on the disputed premise that the utility had a valid easement. Moreover, the owners' trespass and conversion claims for the first incident were time-barred by &sect; 46-3-204, but their trespass and conversion claims for the second incident were not time-barred by &sect; 46-3-204 as these claims were for a new intrusion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county and the cities contended that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the sign companies and ordering them to permit construction of the signs at issue.

On appeal, the court found that, because the county sign ordinance was struck down in its entirety on constitutional grounds, the ordinance was wholly void and of no force and effect from the date it was enacted. Accordingly, the trial court correctly determined that the void county sign ordinance could not be used as the basis for the denial of the sign companies' applications. The trial court also correctly determined that the invalidity of the county sign ordinance resulted in there being no valid restriction on the construction of billboards in the county. Therefore, the sign companies obtained vested rights in the issuance of the permits which they sought.</SPAN></P>

Following a petition for habeas corpus, petitioner was granted a retrial on the issue of whether he was mentally retarded and, if he was found not mentally retarded, a retrial on sentencing. Prior to the retrial in the trial court (Georgia), the parties sought appellate guidance on several procedural issues, including the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-7-131(c)(3) and (j), petitioner would be exempt from the death penalty if he could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was mentally retarded. Petitioner argued that the standard of proof applied to mental retardation claims was unconstitutional. The court held that petitioner bore the burden to prove his mental retardation beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also held that the trial of petitioner's claim of mental retardation should be regarded as a completion of the guilt/innocence phase of his original trial and, therefore, that the State was entitled under Ga. Unif. Super. Ct. R. 10.2 to make an opening statement before petitioner. Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-8-71, the State was entitled to make an initial closing argument, petitioner could then make his closing argument, and the State was entitled to make a final closing argument. The court held that the trial court could accept a plea of guilty but mentally retarded if both parties were willing and if the trial court found a factual basis to enter judgment on such a plea.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that exclusionary rule was not applicable in probation revocation proceedings. The supreme court found that the rule's deterrence benefits did not outweigh the costs to the truth-seeking objective which was paramount in the probation system. Because application of the exclusionary rule to probation revocation proceedings would achieve only marginal deterrent effects and would significantly alter and affect the proper administration of the probation system in Georgia, the supreme court concluded that the deterrence benefits of the exclusionary rule do not outweigh the costs to the system. Therefore, under the proper balancing test, neither the federal nor state constitutions required application of the exclusionary rule in state probation revocation proceedings.</SPAN></P>

They argued that they were entitled to an accounting in light of their status as co-tenants with the mother as a result of the joint award of year's support. The supreme court held that the question of the extent of the daughters' interests in the year's support property was resolved in the partitioning judgment, which awarded the daughters their share of the year's support property. Because the partitioning judgment was not appealed, the daughters could complain that they had a greater interest in the property than that which was awarded them. The trial court did not err when it found that the daughters were not entitled to receive rents and profits generated by the set-apart property during their minority or during their majority.

However, the special schools authorized by the constitution were not competitors with locally controlled school in regard to the education of general K-12 students; rather, the constitutionally significant matters that made a school &quot;special&quot; were directly related to the school itself, its student body and its curriculum. Such special school were those that enrolled students with special needs or those that taught only certain special subject, like vocational trade schools. From both the natural meaning of the &quot;special schools&quot; phrase and the constitutional history of art. VIII, &sect; V, para. VII(a), special schools were not general K-12 schools.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver filed a negligence action against appellee police officer in his individual and his official capacity, and a city. She challenged an order of the trial court (Georgia), which granted the officer summary judgment in his individual capacity, finding that the claims against him failed as a matter of law because he was protected from suit pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-92-3(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer drove his police cruiser into the back of the driver's automobile while conducting a routine patrol. The driver was injured during the accident. The supreme court held that by the passage of O.C.G.A. &sect; 36- 92-3, the legislature intended to foreclose all recovery against municipal employees for torts committed within the scope of employment and involving the use of a covered motor vehicle. The driver brought a claim pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-92-3, and the trial court granted summary judgment to the city. Because the driver did not enumerate that decision, it was final and pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-92-3(d), provided a &quot;complete bar&quot; to any future suit brought by the driver against the city or the employee and involving the tortious act at issue in the case. O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-92-3, as applied by the trial court, was constitutional. The driver, due to her failure to send ante litem notice, was foreclosed from any recovery. She sought to recover for her injuries from the city, but that action was dismissed due to her failure to send ante litem notice within six months as required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-33-5(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of a Georgia trial court that convicted him of malice murder, three counts of aggravated battery, aggravated sodomy, kidnapping with bodily injury, and aggravated assault and that imposed a death sentence for the murder conviction, 20 years each for the aggravated battery and aggravated assault convictions, and life without parole for the kidnapping and sodomy convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After drinking beer near a recreational trail, defendant knocked the victim from her bicycle as she rode by his location. He dragged her off of the trail to a location shielded from view by vegetation and then sexually assaulted her and beat her. She died as a result of the injuries sustained in the attack. On review of defendant's convictions, the court held that, because the victim's death was caused by the same actions that established the commission of the three aggravated batteries, the aggravated battery convictions should merge into the malice murder conviction. Aggravated batter was an included offense because it differed from felony murder only in the respect that it involved a less serious injury to the victim. Because the only difference between aggravated battery and murder was that the former required a less serious injury to the victim, the two offenses meet the required evidence test, and convictions for both offenses established by the same conduct was prohibited by O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-1-6(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and sentences for the three counts of aggravated battery were vacated, but all remaining convictions and sentences, including the death sentence for the murder, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner challenged a judgment of the habeas court (Georgia), which denied his application for a writ of habeas corpus. He argued, among other things, that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in that they were insufficiently prepared for the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of murder and was sentenced to death. The supreme court held that trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to sufficiently develop mitigating evidence from non-experts. Trial counsel failed to fully investigate whether petitioner had suffered one or more brain injuries prior to his crimes. They also performed deficiently by unduly limiting their interviews of petitioner's family and friends to an unreasonably narrow range of persons. There was a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different outcome in the sentencing phase of petitioner's trial if that additional evidence had been presented at trial. There was additional evidence from non-experts concerning petitioner's traumatic childhood. Habeas counsel were also able to obtain additional evidence concerning petitioner's change in behavior and apparent mental distress following two head injuries. The habeas court correctly concluded that petitioner's claim that he was tried while incompetent was barred by procedural default under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-14-48(d) because the claim was not pursued to a conclusion at trial and was not raised on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the habeas court's order insofar as it denied petitioner's claim that he was entitled to a new sentencing trial and directed that his death sentence be vacated. It affirmed the order regarding the denial of petitioner's claim that he was mentally incompetent at the time of trial, and it remanded the case with direction regarding several remaining issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and convicted of murdering two people and robbing one of them. On review, the court held that the trial court abused the discretion granted by O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-1.2 in allowing the victims' family members to testify by offering opinions about defendant and the murders because such victim impact evidence unduly prejudiced the jury. The witnesses testified that the victims were &quot;shot and left in a patch of kudzu as if they were a piece of trash on the side of the road,&quot; that the victims were &quot;left under trash and branches, left to die,&quot; and that the crimes were &quot;a senseless, selfish act of nothing but wickedness and evil.&quot; While some of the witnesses' characterizations may have been supported by the evidence presented at trial, the witnesses did not have personal knowledge of many of the facts to which they testified, and the statements, even if supported by the evidence, were particularly inflammatory and prejudicial coming from members of the victims' families. Further, the witnesses were also improperly allowed to present their own unduly prejudicial characterizations and opinions of defendant.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the photo ID requirement for in-person voting was authorized by Ga. Const. art. II, &sect; I, para. I, as a reasonable procedure for verifying that the individual appearing to vote in person was actually the same person who registered to vote. Further, the photo ID requirement was not an impermissible qualification on voting in violation of Ga. Const. art. II, &sect; I, para.II. The Act did not deprive any Georgia voter from casting a ballot in any election. Next, no voter was disenfranchised by the Act, and the Act did not violate Ga. Const. art. II, &sect; I, para. III. Finally, the Act did not violate the equal protection clause of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed suit against defendants, a corporation and its officers, under the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-14-1 et seq. The officers challenged an order of the trial court (Georgia), which granted the State's motions for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and an interlocutory injunction under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-65. It also granted the State's motion to continue a receivership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the officers' argument that the TRO was invalid was moot because the TRO had been superseded by the interlocutory injunction, and the officers did not argue that any alleged error in entering the TRO somehow infected the interlocutory injunction, which was entered after notice to the officers and a full hearing. The verified complaint and the State's attorney's certification were sufficient under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-65(b)(1) and (2) to show that immediate and irreparable injury would result unless relief was granted before the officers could be heard in opposition and why notice would not be required. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining the officers from disposing of any of the documents or assets of the corporation and continuing the receivership. The officers controlled the assets that were a subject of the litigation, raising the possibility that they could be dissipated before the litigation is resolved. Although the officers made several vague arguments about the powers granted to the receiver, they failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in granting those powers.</SPAN></P>

His only available means to withdraw his guilty pleas was through habeas corpus proceedings. Even if defendant's motion had been timely, he voluntarily and intelligently entered his guilty pleas.

He did not identify any additional witnesses or evidence in mitigation that he could have presented had he been granted a continuance. The evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding of the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance based on kidnapping with bodily injury beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-30(b)(2). The stab wound to the victim's thigh and his strangulation constituted bodily injuries sufficient to complete the statutory aggravating circumstance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, chairman of a board of education, sued defendant board members, claiming that H.B. 563 (Ga. 2009) was unconstitutional as applied to him and that the members exceeded their authority by replacing him. The trial court (Georgia) temporarily enjoined enforcement of H.B. 563. It later found the chairman in contempt for violating its order. The chairman appealed. The trial court then determined that H.B. 563 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">H.B. 563 provided that the board should organize by selecting one of their number as chairperson at a meeting to be held in 2009, no later than 30 days after the bill became effective. The trial court temporarily enjoined compliance with the bill, but ordered that all board members be entitled to include items on the agenda. The court held that the plain language of the order made clear that the board members had the right to include items on the agenda consistent with O.C.G.A. &sect; 50-14-1, but that the chairman had deliberately prevented board members from appealing his decisions. The trial court properly held the chairman in contempt. The court held, however, that H.B. 563 was an unconstitutional bill of attainder under Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. X. Prior to the passage of H.B. 563, the chairman's term was not set to expire until December 31, 2010; but H.B. 563 operated to cut short the chairman's four-year term that had previously been established by O.C.G.A. &sect; 20-2-57(a) and local board policy. As the only chairman who was currently serving a term that would be cut short by the application of H.B. 563, the statute was an impermissible bill of attainder as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order holding the chairman in contempt but reversed the trial court's finding that H.B. 563 was constitutional as applied to the chairman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two related death penalty cases, defendants sought interim review to consider whether the trial court (Georgia) erred in denying their motions to declare unconstitutional the statutory aggravating circumstances described in O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-30(b)(8) and in holding that the immunity from prosecution prescribed by O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-3-24.2 could not apply to their cases because the officers' entry was in fact lawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants opened fire on a deputy, killing him, as he and other drug task force members were executing a no-knock warrant. First, the O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-30(b)(8) circumstance, allowing the death penalty, regardless of scienter, where a defendant kills a peace officer, bore a rational relationship to the legitimate State purpose of providing deterrence of possible harm to peace officers. Accordingly, the statutory aggravating circumstance did not violate equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. II. Second, the trial court erred in holding that, if the jury returned a sentence other than life, the jurors would have been asked to answer a special interrogatory on the question of the defendants' knowledge of the victim's status as a peace officer. Third, the immunity from prosecution prescribed by O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-3-24.2 did not apply to defendants because the officers' entry was lawful. Finally, one of the defendant's had the right to be present at an evidentiary hearing on the State's motion to disqualify the other defendant's attorneys in order to prevent the disclosure of confidential and privileged information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part the judgment, and remanded the matter with direction.</SPAN></P>

The special condition of probation was required by the sex-offender registration statute,&nbsp;&sect; 42-1-12. The sex-offender registry requirement was regulatory and not punitive in nature. The facts supporting the requirement that defendant register as a sex offender were found by the jury. The requirement that defendant register as a sex offender did not violate the Eighth Amendment's proscription against the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment. The superior court was authorized to make sex-offender registration a special condition of probation. Inasmuch as the offense of cruelty to children, for which defendant was convicted, was found in Title 16 of the Official Code of Georgia, and defendant's conduct that led to his conviction, requiring his victim to touch his penis and requiring her to permit him to touch her breast, was a sexual offense, &sect; 42-1-12 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the employer had opportunity in the indemnity suit to challenge the reasonableness of the fees and costs incurred by the power company; therefore, the statute provided procedural due process. Substantive due process was not violated because the purpose of &sect; 46-3-40(b) was to prevent injury to persons and property from high voltage utilities, and maintaining public safety and welfare was a legitimate legislative purpose. The threat of an indemnity action against an employer for failing to provide notice to power companies about its activities near high voltage fixtures served the legitimate legislative purpose by motivating employers to follow the notice requirement and thereby prevent accidents.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the indictment alleged that the murder and assault were committed on February 6, but the evidence established that the crimes took place during the early moments of February 7. The court held that the State was not required to prove that the crimes occurred on February 6 because the indictment did not specifically state that the date was material. The evidence was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find defendant guilty of burglary. The fact that the traverse jury source list was compiled by a board of jury commissioners that was comprised of only five members, rather than six members as directed by O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-12-20, did not vitiate the arrays.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dade County, Georgia, homestead exemptions, H.B. 918 and 919 (Ga. 2002), were passed by the legislature and approved by county voters. The taxpayer argued that the homestead exemptions for ad valorem taxes and school taxes violated the Uniformity Clause, Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I, para. III(a), which required that all taxation be uniform on the same class of property. The court held that, construing the Uniformity Clause with the tax exemption clauses, Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; II, para. II(a)(1) and (2), the homestead exemptions were not unconstitutional. Although the nature of tax exemptions was at odds with the equality of taxation sought by the Uniformity Clause, the Constitution authorized such exemptions. The court rejected the taxpayer's contention that the school tax exemption (H.B. 919) violated Ga. Const. art. VIII, &sect; VI, para. I, which required that school taxes be imposed on correctly assessed values. The school taxes would be imposed on correctly assessed values, but the values of certain properties would be reduced by the homestead exemption.

Once this showing was made, the guardian was required to show that continuation of the temporary guardianship would best promote the child's welfare and happiness. With that narrowing construction of the best interest standard, the court upheld the best interest standard in &sect; 29-2-8(b) as constitutional. Federal constitutional law did not require a showing that the mother was unfit before custody may be awarded to a third party. Therefore, the juvenile court erred by denying the petition to terminate the temporary guardianship without finding by clear and convincing evidence that such termination would harm the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer filed an action against appellees, a county board of assessors and the development authority of the county, seeking a declaration that the valuation method they used for leasehold estates arising from a local development authority sale-leaseback bond transaction was illegal. He challenged an order of the trial court (Georgia), which granted the board's motion to dismiss and the authority's motion for judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged that the valuation method was illegal, unconstitutional, and constituted a failure of the board and authority to perform their duty. The supreme court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The taxpayer made material allegations that could be supported by admissible evidence on the issue of whether the valuation method fairly and justly approximated the fair market value of a bond transaction leasehold estate. The trial court erred in granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings. The board and authority failed to show that they were clearly entitled to judgment. The taxpayer provided an affidavit of a qualified expert real estate appraiser, which specifically opined that the valuation method did not fairly and accurately determine the fair market value of a bond transaction leasehold estate. Although O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-80-16.1(e) gave county boards of tax assessors authority to use simplified methods for determining the value of a bond transaction leasehold estate, it did not relieve the board and authority from their duty to value the leasehold estate at its fair market value.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city cited the owner for violating the local ordinance when she failed to cut the high grass on the portion of her property adjacent to a public right-of-way.

The penalties that it levied furthered the public purpose of abating nuisances and promoting the general health and welfare of the community. The penalties also gave the city a means to pay for maintenance of properties whose owners failed to comply. The ordinance was, therefore, a valid use of the city's police power. The ordinance did not target the elderly. In addition, it was not a constitutionally prohibited involuntary servitude.

The daughter argued that as a potential beneficiary of her father's estate, she was not afforded constitutional due process because she did not receive actual notice of the proceedings and because of a conflict of interest between the conservator's position as both conservator and executrix. The court rejected these arguments. The trial court followed the statutory requirements of &sect; 29-5-81(b) by appointing a guardian ad litem for the ward, who received personal service of the discharge proceedings and who reviewed and approved the final settlement. The court held that the daughter, as a possible beneficiary of her father's will, did not have a legally protected interest in the conservator's settlement and discharge proceedings such that she was required to have actual notice of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow argued that her malpractice claims were timely under the tolling provision for mental incompetence, O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 9-3-90(a) and 9-3-91, and that the non-tolling statute applicable to medical malpractice claims, O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-3-73(b), was unconstitutional since it discriminated against the mentally incompetent in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. II. The supreme court held that the trial court properly rejected the widow's equal protection challenge to the non-tolling statute for mental incompetence in medical malpractice actions. The General Assembly's retention of other tolling provisions, in whole or in part, did not render irrational its nullification of the tolling provision for mental incompetence in general medical malpractice claims. The General Assembly could rationally conclude that where a patient actually died, or a medical instrument or other foreign object was found in his or her body, the risk of false or frivolous claims of medical malpractice was sufficiently reduced that any gain from suspending the tolling provisions would be outweighed by the loss of a remedy in meritorious cases.</SPAN></P>

When defendant failed to cancel the deed plaintiffs made a written demand for liquidated damages, which defendant failed to pay. The supreme court held that plaintiffs were allowed to satisfy the preconditions for suit on behalf of the entire class. Plaintiffs' written demand and filing of the lawsuit put defendant on notice of a class action that was governed by &sect; 44-14-3 and included all of its customers whose security deeds had not been cancelled as required by that same substantive law. The requirement of &sect; 44-14-3 for exhaustion of administrative remedies was no less fundamental than the requirement for a demand of liquidated damages. The failure to fulfil either of those preconditions for suit absolutely barred recovery.

Under &sect; 24-9-84.1(a)(2), if defendant testified, evidence that he had been convicted of a crime was admissible if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment of one year or more if the probative value of admitting the evidence substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect. The court held that due process was not violated by permitting the impeachment of defendant with his prior convictions. The constitutional right to testify did not carry with it a right to prohibit impeachment by prior convictions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting a witness to testify for the State although he was not included on the State's witness list.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the clients sued the attorneys, they did not file an expert affidavit with their complaint as required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-9.1 for a professional negligence claim. As a result, the lawyers filed a partial motion to dismiss. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that nothing in &sect; 9-11-9.1 imposed a cost or fee for filing or obtaining an expert affidavit. Rather, the &quot;costs&quot; were created by private actors, not any state actor. Since no state actor has exacted the harm of which the clients complain, the statute does not violate the right to due process. In addition, because the law applied uniformly to any person or entity bringing a lawsuit for professional negligence, it did not violate equal protection. Any disparities in the costs associated with obtaining an expert affidavit were circumstances beyond the scope or control of the statute. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it ruled that the statute withstood the constitutional challenges raised by the clients.</SPAN></P>

At the conclusion of a bench trial on sentencing, the Paulding County (Georgia) trial court found the existence of multiple statutory aggravating circumstances and sentenced defendant to death for each of the murders pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-30(b). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his two brothers plotted to rob and rape the mother at her home, where they found her with her infant son and three-year-old daughter. Defendant argued that there was no factual basis for his guilty plea because the evidence of asportation of the victims was insufficient. The court held that although the movement of the victims spanned a relatively-short duration and occurred while most of the other offenses were ongoing or not yet committed, the movement was not an inherent part of any of the other offenses and enhanced the control of the brothers over them, satisfying O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-40 as it was in force prior to July 1, 2009. The factual basis for defendant's guilty plea to child molestation was his admission that he himself had undressed the three-year-old for the purpose of his sexual arousal. The trial court did not err in finding the statutory aggravating circumstance addressing one who has directed another to murder as his or her agent or employee under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-30(b)(6) because defendant directed his 15-year-old brother to silence the daughter and gave him a knife. The trial court did not err in imposing the two death sentences.</SPAN></P>

She requested an order extending any approaching deadline under the &quot;five-year rule&quot; codified at O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 9-2-60(b) and 9-11-41(e). The trial court noted that the last order it entered was the April 7, 2004 order granting the owner a certificate of immediate review, and it found that the case had been dismissed by operation of law on April 7, 2009, two months before the owner filed her Rule 7.1 motion. The supreme court held that the trial court properly dismissed the case. The last qualifying order entered in the case was the certificate of immediate review signed by the trial court and entered on the trial court's records on April 7, 2004. If the owner wished to further litigate her claims, she had ample time to obtain a trial court order that would have allowed that, but she failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractors filed suit seeking, among other things, a preliminary injunction restraining defendants, the Georgia State Licensing Board for Residential and General Contractors and a county, from enforcing a licensing law, O.C.G.A. &sect; 43-41-1 et seq. The Board challenged judgments of the Superior Court of Muscogee County (Georgia), which denied its motion to dismiss or transfer proceedings and granted a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that venue of was proper in Muscogee County. There was substantial equitable relief sought that was common to the board and to the resident county. It found that the superior court was plainly in error in finding that harm flowed to the contractors from any failure on the part of the county to comply with notice of the licensing law pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 43-41-14(b) or to provide other specific notice of the licensing law going into effect. The lack of notice did not result in the contractors' consequent failure to comply with the law and thereby obtain an exemption under O.C.G.A. &sect; 43-41-17(a). Section 43-41-14(b) became effective on May 29, 2007, approximately a month before the July 1, 2007 deadline for filing an application for examination exemption. Under that general statute the contractors were charged with notice of the licensing law, including the time-limited provision allowing examination exemption. The grant of the preliminary injunction operated oppressively on the rights of the county and Board and also on the rights of the citizens of the State. It effectively enjoined, without apparent valid basis, the operation of a licensing law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor operated a retail salvage store. He displayed merchandise for sale to the public in front of the store in an area where there was a sidewalk and places to park. Section 9-8-45 regulated the display of goods and merchandise for sale outside stores. The city informed the lessee that he was in violation of the ordinance and subject to criminal prosecution. The supreme court held that the ordinance was sufficiently definite so that a person of ordinary intelligence need not guess at its meaning. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the city on the lessee's claim that the ordinance effected a regulatory taking of property. The stated purpose of the ordinance was to prohibit the obstruction of public sidewalks and parking areas by the display of goods and merchandise. There was a legitimate government interest in safe travel, including pedestrian access. The lessee failed to show that the ordinance deprived him of any economically viable use of his leasehold. The ordinance regulated businesses selling merchandise in a certain manner, and the trial court did not err in determining that the Zoning Procedures Law, O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-66-1 et seq., did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant health care provider sought review of a Georgia trial court's decision, which held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 51-13-1, which limited awards of noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases to a predetermined amount, was unconstitutional by violating the right to a jury trial under Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. XI(a). In so ruling, the trial court entered judgment for appellees, a patient and her husband, in the full amount awarded by the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the art. I, &sect; I, para. XI(a) constitutional right to a jury trial included the right to a jury trial for claims involving the negligence of a health care provider, with an attendant right to an award of the full measure of damages, including noneconomic damages, as determined by a jury. The court further found that the noneconomic damages caps in &sect; 51-12-1 unconstitutionally infringed on this right. By requiring a trial court to reduce a noneconomic damages award determined by a jury that exceeded the statutory limit, &sect; 51-13-1 nullified the jury's findings of fact regarding damages, and thus, undermined the jury's basic function. The fact that &sect; 51-13-1 permitted full recovery of noneconomic damages up to $ 350,000 was not relevant because the very existence of the caps, in any amount, violated the right to trial by jury. Similarly, the existence of punitive damages, statutes authorizing multiple damage awards, and a trial court's remittitur power did not demonstrate the constitutionality of the caps. As none of the exceptions to the general rule were applicable, the court further found that &sect; 51-12-1 was wholly void from the date it was enacted.</SPAN></P>

The tax for which it sought voter approval was within the special district within the county. The HOST was a district tax levied to provide for services within that special district pursuant to Ga. Const. art. IX, &sect; II, para. VI. The Constitution and the HOST Act did not restrict the provision of local government services to the governing authority of the county whose geographical boundary was coterminous with that of the special district.

The habeas court found that petitioner delivered the petition to prison officials on June 27, 2008, before the statutory deadline of July 1, 2008, O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-14-42(c)(1), although the petition was not received by the habeas court until July 2, 2008, after the deadline.

The mailbox rule applied only in the pursuit of an appeal by one who falls under the requirements of O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-14-52 and did not apply to the filing of an initial petition.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the term of years option, i.e., &quot;for not less than 25 years and not exceeding life imprisonment,&quot; O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-1(b). The court held that the applicable statutes gave fair warning that defendant could be sentenced either to life imprisonment, for which he was eligible to considered for parole after 30 years, or to a term of years, with the minimum sentence being 25 years without parole and with any additional years, which could include a defendant's entire life span, being likewise not subject to any possibility of parole under &sect; 16-1-2. Therefore, defendant could fully understand the possible consequences when weighing whether to enter a guilty plea to the charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patients filed a medical malpractice action against appellees, an emergency room doctor, emergency medical specialists, and a hospital.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that as a general law that operated alike on all who came within its scope, &sect; 51-1-29.5(c) complied with the uniformity provision of the Georgia Constitution, Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VI, para. IV(a). Section 51-1-29.5(c) was a general law because it operated uniformly upon all health care liability claims arising from emergency medical care as provided in the statute, and classification of the designated class was not arbitrary or unreasonable. Because the legislative purpose of &sect; 51-1-29.5(c) was legitimate, and the classification drawn had some reasonable relation to furthering that purpose, the classification did not violate the equal protection clause, Ga. Const. art. I, &sect;I, para. II. Although &sect; 51-1-29.5(c) raised the burden of proof in certain cases, it did not deprive one of any other fundamental right. Promoting affordable liability insurance for health care providers and hospitals were legitimate legislative purposes. Section 51-1-29.5(c) satisfied due process requirements because it was not so vague and indefinite in its meaning that persons of ordinary intelligence had to necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a declaratory action, claiming that O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-12 was unconstitutional as applied to him. He challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia), which granted the State's motion to dismiss and finding that &sect; 42-1-12 was constitutional. He argued that requiring him to register as a sexual offender violated the Eighth Amendment and that &sect; 42-1-12 was over-inclusive in violation of substantive due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery and false imprisonment of a minor. After he was released from prison, he was required to register as a sex offender pursuant to &sect; 42-1-12. The supreme court held that sexual offender registry requirements such as those contained in &sect; 42-1-12 were regulatory, not punitive, in nature. Therefore, the registry requirement was not a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Because the registration requirements themselves did not constitute punishment, it was of no consequence whether or not one committed an offense that was &quot;sexual&quot; in nature before being required to register. Section 42-1-12 did not violate substantive due process. It was rational to conclude that requiring those who falsely imprisoned minors who were not the child's parent to register pursuant to &sect; 42-1-12 advanced the State's legitimate goal of informing the public for purposes of protecting children from those who would harm them. It was not unreasonable or completely arbitrary to believe that a child could be more at risk of harm from someone who would falsely imprison the child who was not the child's parent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees filed a defamation action against appellants, which offered to settle the case under the Tort Reform Act of 2005, O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-68(a). Appellees did not respond, which was deemed a rejection under &sect; 9-11-68(c). The trial court (Georgia) granted appellants' motion for summary judgment. Appellants challenged the trial court's order denying their motion for attorney's fees on the ground that &sect; 9-11-68 violated the Georgia Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the trial court clearly erred in finding that &sect; 9-11-68 impeded access to the courts and violated Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. XII. Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. XII was never intended to provide a right of access to the courts but was intended to provide only a right of choice between self-representation and representation by counsel. Section 9-11-68(b)(1) did not deny litigants access to the courts but simply set forth certain circumstances under which attorney's fees could be recoverable. Therefore, even if a constitutional right of access to the courts provision did exist, it would not be applicable. Because there was no constitutional requirement that attorney's fees be awarded only pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-15-14 or O.C.G.A. &sect; 13-6-11, the trial court's finding to the contrary was erroneous. Section 9-11-68 did not violate the uniformity clause of the Georgia Constitution, Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VI, para. IV(a). Because &sect; 9-11-68 applied uniformly throughout the State to all tort cases, it was a general law. The fact that the statute applied to tort cases, but not other civil actions, did not render it an impermissible special law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the trial court (Georgia), which convicted him of murder and two counts of arson in the first degree in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-7-60. He was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the evidence was sufficient to authorize a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of the crimes of which he was convicted. The jury convicted defendant on two counts of arson in the first degree. One count alleged that the structure burned was a dwelling house, and the other count alleged that it was reasonably foreseeable that the fire could endanger human life. However, the evidence showed that only one continuous act of setting multiple fires in the same house constituted the act of arson. The trial court abused its discretion by refusing to exclude in the guilt/innocence phase evidence showing that the victims' dogs perished in the fire that defendant set because its probative value in proving the charges in the indictment was outweighed by undue prejudice. However, in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, including his own confession,  it was highly probable the error did not contribute to the verdict. Out-of-court statements a co-defendant made to friends during the concealment phase of the conspiracy between him and defendant bore sufficient indicia of reliability to be admissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the trial court's sentencing order insofar as it imposed two sentences for the one crime of arson and directed the trial court to vacate the second of those duplicative sentences, and It affirmed all of defendant's remaining convictions and sentences, including his death sentences for the murders.</SPAN></P>

The statute was not void for vagueness. The imposition of consecutive sentences did not involve any denial of due process: prohibited behavior was described in various criminal statutes, along with possible punishments. Notice that the specific punishment would be determined as a matter of discretion upon consideration of the facts of each case was also provided by statute. The court held that nothing in the sentences imposed or the language of &sect; 17-10-10 implicated the rule of lenity. Neither the statute nor the sentences were ambiguous; the trial court had discretion to impose consecutive sentences. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury trial prior to imposition of the consecutive sentences because such imposition did not depend on the finding of a statutorily prescribed fact. Even if &sect; 17-10-10(a) did require such factfinding, the Sixth Amendment would not mandate jury determination of any fact declared necessary to the imposition of consecutive, in lieu of concurrent, sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a convicted felon, and several others were at the victim's home to drink alcoholic beverages and watch football. Defendant and the victim began arguing in the presence of several witnesses. Defendant left the house exclaiming to onlookers that he would kill the victim; he returned an hour later with a shotgun and shot the victim in the chest. Defendant claimed that he acted in self-defense and that the trial court failed to properly charge the jury on his defense. The court observed that the trial court gave an instruction on self-defense verbatim from the Suggested Pattern Jury Instructions, explaining the affirmative defense of justification and the burden on the State to disprove it. There was no requirement that the trial court instruct on self-defense separately as to each of the various crimes alleged. The trial court did not err in refusing to charge that a status felony, including the possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon, was not inherently dangerous. In this case, such a charge was not adjusted to the evidence because defendant intentionally aimed and shot a loaded weapon at the victim in a manner that was inherently dangerous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the request of a county attorney, a probate court judge filed a petition under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-8-1 et seq. to establish a copy of an ordinance because the original had been lost. A land and development company challenged a judgment of the superior court (Georgia), which found that the ordinance was a public record under &sect; 24-8-1, established a copy as an original, and denied its motion for involuntary dismissal under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-41(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted a new zoning ordinance. The company requested a letter verifying that its proposed landfill complied with the ordinance. The county refused to issue the letter. The company sought mandamus to compel issuance of the letter. During the mandamus proceedings, it was determined that the ordinance was not clearly identified in or attached to the board's minutes. The supreme court held that the plain language of &sect; 24-8-1 showed that it applied to &quot;any public records&quot; and did not include any limitation to court records. The fact that county ordinances could not normally be proved by parol evidence did not prevent such proof. A lost or destroyed ordinance could be established by parol evidence. The evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that a copy was a true and correct duplicate of the original ordinance. The trial court's decree did not have the effect of either adopting or amending any zoning ordinance. The supreme court's authority to reestablish a previously adopted ordinance, like its authority to construe statutes, did not violate the constitutional separation of powers or constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to impeach the witness with certified copies of his prior convictions for robbery and burglary. The trial court found that the convictions were untimely under &sect; 24-9-84.1. The supreme court held that the trial court did not err when it declined to permit defense counsel to use the prior convictions after determining that more than ten years had elapsed since the witness was released from the confinement resulting from the convictions and that defense counsel had not provided specific facts and circumstances demonstrating that the probative value of the convictions outweighed their prejudicial effect. Probation did not qualify as confinement under &sect; 24-9-84.1(b). The trial court did not err in finding that ineffective assistance of counsel had not been proven when trial counsel failed to impeach a witness with evidence of charges pending against the witness. Defendant failed to establish that the outcome of his trial would have been different had the witness been impeached. There were eyewitness identifications of defendant as the shooter, evidence that he had been looking for the victim and believed the victim had robbed him, and evidence that he had been shot.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that &sect; 42-1-12 was not unconstitutionally vague in failing to define the term &quot;temporary residence.&quot; The offender did not find the term &quot;temporary residence&quot; vague. He had reported changes of his address at least four times. The offender failed to establish that he was treated differently from a similarly situated nonresident sexual offender entering the State.

The taxpayers did not pay or tender the redemption amount. The court rejected the taxpayers' contention that the first notice they received might have been defective, because there was no dispute that a second notice was proper, and &sect; 48-4-47(a) barred not only the filing of a suit to set aside a tax deed without payment of the redemption amount, but also maintaining such a suit. The court also rejected their contention that &sect; 48-4-47 violated their constitutional due process rights, although the redemption amount of $ 112,516 dwarfed the original $ 2,000 in unpaid taxes the property was sold to satisfy, due to the addition of taxes, costs, and penalties pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-4-42.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-12-4 was unconstitutionally vague, because the language set forth in subparagraphs (b) and (f) created an ambiguity as to the conduct prohibited because the same facts could be used to either find an individual criminally responsible for injuring an animal or to authorize the humane injuring of the animal. The court disagreed. Read as a whole, &sect; 16-12-4 (b) explained when a person is liable for cruelty to animals, while &sect; 16-12-4(f)(1) and (2) explained that killing or wounding an animal could be justified under some circumstances if the killing was &quot;humane.&quot; &quot;Humane&quot; meant done in such a way as to demonstrate compassion for the animal, as the circumstances allowed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for new trial based on the State's failure to reveal evidence concerning a witness's assistance in another murder case. Defendant could not establish that a reasonable probability existed that the outcome of his trial would have been different if he had been provided the information. The trial court's determination that defendant voluntarily consented to searches was supported by the evidence. The investigator who obtained the consents testified that no threats or promises were made to defendant and that he was free to leave. The admission of defendant's prior convictions during the sentencing phase was harmless. The victim in the prior crimes testified, there was overwhelming evidence of the statutory aggravating circumstances supporting the death penalty, and the jury was authorized to consider the similar transaction evidence.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court (Georgia) found that the child was deprived. Temporary custody was granted to the child's maternal aunt and her husband, who filed a petition to terminate both parents' parental rights. The juvenile court granted the petition, and the father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was on probation for child molestation and cruelty to children at the time the child was born in 2003. A warrant was issued for the father's arrest because he was living in the same home as the child. He then left with the child and her mother. In 2007, he was arrested for violations of his probation, which was revoked. The mother was missing. The child told her aunt of various acts of sexual abuse by the father. The father raised a constitutional challenge to O.C.G.A. &sect; 5-6-35(a)(12), which required that appeals from orders terminating parental rights be by application rather than be a matter of direct appeal. The court held that it could consider this matter although the father did not raise the challenge in the trial court, because it presented a matter of appellate procedure that was not ripe until an adverse decision was reached below. The court rejected the father's equal protection challenge because termination cases and other suspensions of custody were not similar, and because the classification created by &sect; 5-6-35(a)(12) was reasonable and supported by the State's legitimate interest in not permitting a deprived child to languish in temporary care.</SPAN></P>

The habeas court (Georgia) denied the habeas petition, concluding that the trial court's denial of bail was a reasonable exercise of that court's discretion. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against petitioner arose out of his taking money from an elderly woman and investing it in Belize. Petitioner had no assets in the United States and numerous assets and money in Belize and Nicaragua, and he traveled to Belize frequently. Petitioner's wife testified that she was willing to post her home as bail, although she owed over $ 700,000 on it and did not know what it was worth, and that petitioner would surrender his passport. Petitioner produced seven witnesses, three of whom serviced his cars, who testified that they knew him and did not believe he was a flight risk. However, he had been indicted on 16 counts of criminal activity that could result in significant incarceration if he were convicted. Given the evidence that petitioner did not own his home or any assets in the United States and had allegedly funneled significant amounts of money to Belize, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying bail. There was no right to bail other than in misdemeanor cases under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-6-1(a), and the constitutional provisions against excessive bail, Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. XVII, and the U.S. Const. amend. VIII, did not grant a right to bail.</SPAN></P>

He filed a general demurrer asserting the unconstitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-10-56 on equal protection grounds, which the trial court (Georgia) denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While an inmate, defendant was in a common area for personal time.

The deputy told him he would have to wait, whereupon defendant crossed into a restricted area and began shouting and using profanity at the deputy; he eventually charged the deputy and punched him in the face, head, and chest. Another deputy was required to tackle and handcuff defendant. Defendant argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-10-56 denied him equal protection because it imposed felony punishment and allowed the crime to be committed by a single individual, whereas the offense of riot under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-11-30 was punished as a misdemeanor and was committed by two or more persons acting in concert. The court held that defendant was not similarly situated to persons charged under &sect; 16-11-30 because only those charged with riot in a penal institution, the same crime as defendant, were similarly situated. There was no contention that defendant was punished differently from others accused and convicted of the same crime. Because defendant failed to show disparate treatment, his claim failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant met the victim in the workplace in 2004, and the two began a romantic relationship. Defendant moved in with the victim and her four children. The pair married in 2006; however, soon the relationship began to deteriorate, and the couple had repeated heated arguments. During one argument, defendant drew a knife on the victim, telling her that &quot;he was going to kill her&quot; and that &quot;if he couldn't have her, nobody else will.&quot; He moved out, but continued to contact the victim and ask to move back in. Eventually, he stabbed her repeatedly in the neck as she waited at a bus stop. Defendant argued that the murder and voluntary manslaughter statutes,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-5-1 and 16-5-2, were unconstitutional on several bases.  Because he did not raise this challenge until his amended motion for new trial, it was not reviewed. Such challenges could not be raised after a guilty verdict. The trial court did not err in excluding testimony by a psychologist who would have testified that defendant was depressed at the time of the killing. Defendant never raised the defenses of insanity, delusional compulsion, or mental incompetency, and depression was not a legal defense to the murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county development authority filed suit against the State of Georgia, challenging the constitutionality of the War on Terrorism Local Assistance Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-75-11(c). It sought review of an order of the superior court (Georgia), which found that it was within the category of authorities governed by the statute and denied a petition to confirm and validate the issuance of bonds due to a failure to obtain prior approval from county voters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Development Authorities Law, O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-62-11, the authority was excepted from any referendum requirement arising out of the sale or issuance of bonds. The supreme court held that the uniformity required by Ga. Const. art. IX, &sect; VI, para. III in laws creating development authorities was the same uniformity required by Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VI, para. IV(a) in laws of a general nature. The classification in &sect; 36-75-11 was not unreasonable and arbitrary. The purpose of &sect; 36-75-11 was to protect against the accumulation of excessive bonded indebtedness, and the legislature had a reasonable basis to first address that critical financial situation in counties. Section 36-75-11(c) was not unconstitutional merely because the authority was the only authority that met its criteria. It applied in precisely the same way and without exception to every county development authority throughout the State that currently met or could, in the future, meet its criteria. Section 36-75-11(c) was a general law that preempted by implication the exemption from referenda set forth in &sect; 36-62-11 as to those development authorities that met the criteria of authorities defined in &sect; 36-75-11(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee franchisee sued appellant franchisor, seeking damages for wrongful termination of franchise agreements. The trial court granted partial summary judgment to franchisees, finding an &quot;in-term&quot; clause, as well as a post-termination non-compete clause and a non-disclosure covenant, to be void and unenforceable. The Court of Appeals of Georgia, Second Division, affirmed. The franchisor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The franchisor argued that the clause at issue was a &quot;loyalty provision&quot; and not a restrictive covenant such that it was not subject to being scrutinized for its reasonableness as to time, territory, and scope. The appellate court disagreed. The clause purported to prohibit the franchisees from engaging in a certain type of business during the term of the agreement and, thus, it was a partial restraint of trade designed to lessen competition. Such restraints, no matter the nomenclature assigned to them, were disfavored in Georgia as a matter of public policy. The franchisor argued that the clause at issue should have received less than strict scrutiny because the restraint occurred during the term of the franchise agreement rather than after the agreement's termination. This argument was unsupported by precedent. There was no distinction as to the level of scrutiny applied to a non-competition clause in a franchise or distributorship agreement based on its status as being active during the term of the agreement. The restraint was unreasonable because it lacked any territorial limitation, and a territorial limitation could not have been added by a court to render it enforceable.</SPAN></P>

Appellee, the county district attorney, had brought a complaint against them under the in personam forfeiture provision of the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-14-7(m).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that appellants, who owned or were former owners, officers or operators of three truck stops in south Georgia, engaged in illegal activity by intentionally altering their fuel pumps to indicate that customers were receiving a larger quantity of gasoline or diesel fuel than was actually dispensed, among other actions. It was uncontroverted that no appellant had been convicted of or was even indicted for committing any of the predicate acts set forth in the complaint. In issuing its judgment, the trial court rejected the constitutional challenges to &sect; 16-14-7(m) made by appellants. The Court held that &sect; 16-14-7(m) provided for criminal in personam forfeiture prior to indictment or conviction, despite the Georgia Legislature labeling such cases civil in nature. As a criminal proceeding, the Court held that appellants were to be afforded all of the constitutional safeguards due a criminal defendant and that Georgia's civil procedure rules, which &sect; 16-14-7(m) expressly utilized, were not adequate to protect an in personam forfeiture defendant's constitutional rights. As a result, the Court held &sect; 16-14-7(m) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague under the due process clauses of the Georgia and United States Constitutions. The first interpretation of the statute was that a driver who wanted to make a left turn onto a roadway with multiple lanes had to turn in a manner that left the intersection or other extreme left-hand lane location lawfully available, i.e., open or clear, to traffic moving in the same direction on the roadway the driver had just entered. The second interpretation, under which defendant was convicted, was that a driver who wanted to make a left turn onto a roadway with multiple lanes had to turn so that when he departed from or &quot;left&quot; the intersection or other location, the turning vehicle was itself located in the lane farthest to the left that was lawfully available to traffic moving in that same direction. Thus, the statute could be read as setting forth two contradictory ways for executing a left-hand turn onto a multi-lane roadway. Accordingly, it was too vague to be enforced against a driver of a vehicle making a left turn into a multi-lane roadway that lacked official traffic-control devices directing the driver into which lane to turn.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the town sanctions and dismissed the complaint upon finding that the landowners' counsel perpetrated a fraud on the trial court in connection with a hearing on a motion for an interlocutory injunction. The court upheld the award upon concluding that the landowners' attorney knowingly and willfully presented an inaccurate and false survey in an effort to defraud the court, subvert justice, and gain an unfair advantage. However, the court found that dismissal of the complaint was not a remedy permitted by O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-15-14. The court also found that the landowners were entitled to partial summary judgment since the property at issue was outside the territorial boundaries of the town, therefore, the requirements of the overlay zoning ordinance were invalid as to the property at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose from allegations that defendant signed 33 prescription forms in blank and provided them to his nurse practitioner. Defendant claimed that &sect; 16-13-41(h) was unconstitutionally vague as it did not define what a physician had to do to issue a prescription document. On appeal, the court affirmed. While &sect; 16-13-41(a) and (d)(1) implied that a written prescription was issued only when the ultimate user or someone on his behalf received it, &sect; 16-13-41(h) addressed the issuance of a prescription document rather than the prescription itself as it referred to a prescription document signed in blank. Section 16-13-41(h) broadly included possession of the document by any person other than the one whose signature appeared thereon; thus, a physician's staff member could not be excluded. The language did not result in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement based on the unintended consequences of a woman's death from an overdose on a prescription by defendant based on a stolen blank prescription form as it was not necessary to assess those circumstances in order to determine that &sect; 16-13-41(h) was violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the trial court's dismissal of the city's action, the Court of Appeals affirmed based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the city's failure to exhaust available administrative remedies. The lower courts based its decisions on the Enabling Statutes,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-13-50 et seq., which the city's ordinance was enacted under, authorizing the tax. The city never calculated nor attempted to collect the purported tax from defendants. Thus, the lower courts determined that they lacked subject matter jurisdiction since the city failed to exhaust its administrative remedies first. The court disagreed, finding that whether the hotel tax ordinance actually applied to defendants was a strenuously contested issue, which neither lower court had resolved. In the Court's view, the city could not be required to exhaust an administrative process as a prerequisite to obtaining a determination that the ordinance prescribing that process even applied in the first place. Accordingly, the Court held that until the threshold legal issue of applicability of the hotel tax ordinance was resolved, the city should not be required to submit to the administrative process set forth therein.</SPAN></P>

The high court held that defendant's prosecution in Dawson County was not barred by her former guilty plea conviction in Gwinnett County to possession of methamphetamine and possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. The conspiracy statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-4-8, was not unconstitutionally vague, as the term &quot;overt act&quot; unambiguously referred to a specific type of manifest act made in furtherance of a conspiracy to commit a crime. Approximately one week before trial, defendant filed a notice of alibi with the State. At the beginning of trial, however, the State announced that it intended to prove that the trafficking in amphetamine occurred within two weeks of the date in the indictment, not necessarily on that date exactly. The trial court erred by denying defendant's subsequent motion for a continuance, as she had relied on the date in the indictment for her trial preparation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1984, the property at issue was sold at a tax sale to the corporation. After a series of transactions, the property was conveyed in 2006 by other entities to the LLC by warranty deed; the LLC sought to redeem the property under O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-4-42 as to the corporation's tax deed but was unsuccessful. The trial court conveyed title to the LLC after it redeemed the 1984 tax deed. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the corporation only held a tax deed, it did not have fee simple title but a defeasible title subject to the right of redemption. While the corporation claimed that ripening of title had occurred under O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-4-48, a 1989 amendment that applied expressly to tax deeds executed prior to July 1, 1989, required adverse possession by the tax deed grantee in order for title to ripen. The seven-year period for title to vest by the passage of time under the former version of the statute had not been completed prior to the amendment. The trial court's decision did not violate the  impairment clauses in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's argument that he never possessed the marijuana, which was found in his companion's pocket. Although defendant did not have actual possession of the marijuana, he did have joint constructive possession of it, as proven by the stipulated evidence that he had in his pocket rolling papers with which to smoke it and that both he and his companion admitted that they had just bought the marijuana and were headed to a construction site to smoke it. Next, a police officer testified that she and her partner stopped their car, approached defendant and his companion, and asked for consent to search them. Defendant did not contradict this testimony. Thus, the contact between police and defendant before the discovery of the marijuana was a consensual encounter that involved no coercion or detention and did not have to be supported by reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment. Finally, &sect; 16-13-2(b) did not violate due process by creating a mandatory presumption of guilt. The court interpreted it, as it had before, to render it valid and to carry out the legislative intent of establishing that possession of an ounce or less of marijuana was a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was charged in a delinquency petition with one count of battery, two counts of simple battery, one count of influencing a witness, and two counts of street gang activity. Appellant moved to dismiss the street gang counts on the ground that O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-15-3 and 16-15-4(a) were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss but certified its order for immediate review. Review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The definition of criminal gang activity in O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-15-3(1)(I) provided that a defendant charged with violating the provision had to do more than commit a criminal offense. It also mandated that a defendant's conduct come within one of the defined categories of criminal gang activity enumerated in &sect; 16-15-3(1)(A-H), (J). The description of those crimes together with their correlating statutory provisions in the criminal code provided sufficient notice to the ordinary citizen and clear guidance to law enforcement authorities as to what conduct was forbidden under the statute.&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-15-4(a) informed ordinary citizens of what associations with a criminal street gang were prohibited under the statute. It required that a defendant's association with a group be active and include the commission of an enumerated offense. The statute provided sufficiently definite warning to persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct. The Georgia Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-15-1 et seq., was not overbroad as criminal gang activity was not protected activity even when committed by a group exercising the constitutional right to free association.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the judgment of the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia), which denied their motion to dismiss four counts against them charging them with violations of the Georgia Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act (Act), O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-15-1 et seq. Appellants' request for interlocutory appeal was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellants asserted that the Act infringed upon the First Amendment right to freedom of association and was facially vague and overly broad. The court found that, contrary to appellants' contention, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-15-4(a), as properly construed, did not directly or indirectly infringe upon the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, right to freedom of association since, to support a conviction, the accused must be shown to have conducted or participated in criminal street gang activity through the commission of an actual criminal act, with mere association being insufficient. Section 16-15-4(a) comported with due process requirements because it punished conduct, not association. The court further held that reading &sect; 16-15-4(a) according to the natural and obvious import of its language and in conjunction with the specific definitions in O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-15-3, it provided a sufficiently definite warning to persons of ordinary intelligence of the prohibited conduct and was not susceptible to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement and did not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.

It being his second violation of the registration law, a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment was imposed, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-12(n). The trial court also denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction resulted from his alleged failure to provide his valid current address within 72 hours of changing it. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the indictment and that the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for a second conviction of failing to register constituted cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, para. XVII. The court agreed with defendant and held that the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment was so harsh in comparison to the crime of failing to register that it was unconstitutional. The court made its decision based upon the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and found that Georgia's mandatory punishment of life imprisonment provided the harshest penalty in the nation and provided no sentencing discretion. That gross disparity between Georgia's sentencing scheme and those of the other states reinforced the inference that defendant's crime and sentence were grossly disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to vacate the sentence of life imprisonment and re-sentence defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer had a manufacturing facility in the city and shipped products for sale both inside and outside of the city and Georgia.

The tax was calculated by adding together the gross receipts tax on the sales in the city and an employee tax on the employees in the city, and then subtracting the lesser of the two taxes. The taxpayer argued the occupation tax violated the Commerce Clause because it discriminated against interstate commerce. The high court disagreed; both intrastate and interstate sellers were treated the same way. The taxpayer claimed different companies were not being classified by the same &quot;combination of criteria&quot; as required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-13-10(a), as some businesses paid tax based on their gross receipts, while others paid tax based on the number of their employees.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant alleged that he did not violate the statute and, alternatively, that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.

Because the crime attempted was related to a sexually violent offense, namely rape, he was required to comply with the registration requirements of &sect; 42-1-12(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in convicting him for violating the registry statute due to his failure to provide his new address upon moving. Additionally, the court held that the statute clearly provided that convictions for rape and crimes relating to rape required registration as a sex offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's patrol cruiser was equipped with a video recorder, and he was wearing a microphone. The entire scene was captured on tape, with the deputy being shot nine times. The habeas court granted defendant relief on a number of defendant's ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims. The court found that, as a matter of law, that the absence of trial counsel's deficiencies would not in reasonable probability have changed the outcome of defendant's case. The court, in its analysis, focused on not what trial counsel failed to do but, rather, the evidence that trial counsel actually presented. Namely, trial counsel's failure to have defendant's psychiatrist before the murder testify did not prejudice defendant's defense to a significant degree as evidence was presented with regard to defendant having failed to have taken his medications for several weeks prior to the murder and the psychiatrist's evaluation and treatment of defendant was discussed by other expert witnesses. The court further found that defendant was not prejudiced by trial counsel's focus on an insanity defense while still not abandoning the possibility of a verdict of guilty but mentally ill.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant neighbors filed an action challenging a rezoning decision. Appellees, a county board of commissioners and applicants, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and for failure to join the owners of the rezoned property as indispensable parties under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-19. The trial court granted the motion. The neighbors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that judicial review of the grant or denial of a rezoning application was a de novo proceeding because the General Assembly had not provided a statutory mechanism for the direct appeal to superior court of the zoning decisions of local governing authorities. Thus, the trial court erred when it granted the motion to dismiss after applying the &quot;any evidence&quot; standard to the contents of the administrative record attached to the complaint and concluding there was no set of provable facts asserted in the neighbors' claims which would entitle them to relief and that there was no evidence the neighbors could introduce sufficient to warrant overturning the zoning decision. Next, the trial court also erred in holding that the owners of the property, who were selling the property to the applicants, were indispensable parties. When a property owner entered into a sales contract with a rezoning applicant, which contract was contingent upon the applicant obtaining rezoning, the case could be decided on its merits without prejudicing the rights of the owners since the rezoning applicant was a party and presented a thorough case on behalf of itself and, ultimately, the owner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a Georgia trial court's denial of his motion to quash an indictment charging him with failure to register a new residence address as required under O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-12, Georgia's sex offender registration law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant had been living at a homeless shelter for several months and had registered his address there, when he was asked to leave the shelter, defendant had no street or route address and did not report a change in address. Defendant claimed that the registration requirements of &sect; 42-1-12, inter alia, violated the Due Process Clause of the United States and Georgia Constitutions on vagueness grounds. The court agreed and reversed the denial of defendant's motion to quash. Section 42-1-12(a)(1) specifically stated that homeless did not constitute an address; the term &quot;address&quot; was defined as the street or route address of a sexual offender's residence. Because the statute gave no objective standard or guidelines that would put homeless sex offenders without a street or route address on notice of what conduct was required of them, the court held &sect; 42-1-12&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to those homeless sex offenders who, like defendant, did not have a street or route address. Homeless sex offenders who were able to provide a street or route address, such as the address of a shelter at which they were staying, were not exempt from the registration requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of a Georgia trial court, which convicted him of violating O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-12(e)(3) with regard to failing to renew his registration as a sex offender. Defendant was sentenced, pursuant to &sect; 42-1-12(n)(3), to the minimum term of 10 years, with one year to be served and credit to be given for time served since his arrest. Defendant's motion for new trial was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of child molestation in 1988 and was subsequently paroled in 1993. After revocation of his parole, he was again incarcerated and then released and in 2004 and 2005 he renewed his registration but failed to do so for 2006. On appeal, defendant asserted that &sect; 42-1-12(e)(3), in conjunction with the criminal penalty provision in &sect; 42-1-12(n)(3), violated the state and federal constitutional prohibitions of ex post facto laws. The court disagreed, finding that defendant's failure to abide by the requirement to register as a sexual offender pursuant to &sect; 42-1-12(e)(3) resulted in a new crime under &sect; 42-1-12(n) based, in part, on his status as a child molester. In that regard, the statute was not retrospective and, therefore, was not an ex post facto law. The court further found no merit to defendant's contention that &sect; 42-1-12(e)(3) was ambiguous as the language therein unambiguously required registration by a sex offender who, life defendant, was released from prison on or after July 1, 1996, and failed to register after a subsequent release.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State had filed an application for an interlocutory appeal after a Georgia trial court granted defendant a new trial on three kidnapping charges; the trial court also ruled that the mandatory 25-year sentence set forth in O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-40(b)(2) for kidnapping of a child under the age of 14 constituted cruel and unusual punishment as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of the aggravated assault and kidnapping of his former girlfriend and the kidnappings of her two minor daughters. Defendant had been granted a new trial under O.C.G.A. &sect; 5-5-40 on the three kidnapping convictions on the basis that defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel. On appeal, the court reversed the new trial, vacated the finding as to &sect; 16-5-40's constitutionality, and remanded. While ineffective assistance was found on the basis that trial counsel failed to cross-examine the girlfriend adequately, failed to argue cogently on behalf of a directed verdict motion on the kidnapping charges, and presented only perfunctory closing argument, defendant waived those issues as he did not claim that trial counsel was ineffective on those particular grounds in his motion for new trial. The trial court could not grant a new trial on its own motion under &sect; 5-5-40(h) as the new trial was granted more than 30 days from entry of the judgment. The other issues raised in the motion were not considered, so the matter was remanded for their consideration. The decision as to the constitutionality of &sect; 16-5-40 was premature and, thus, was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendants arose from shooting of an officer who was part of a group executing a no-knock warrant at a residence. Defendants asserted that the trial court erred by failing to determine pre-trial whether they were entitled to immunity from prosecution under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-3-24.2. The court, in construing &sect; 16-3-24.2 for the first time, agreed that the trial court erred by failing to make a pre-trial determination as to whether defendants were entitled to immunity. The court held that the trial court correctly denied defendants' requests for a jury instruction that would have required them to have been found to have knowledge that the victim was a police officer when he was fatally shot since the court construed the O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-30(b)(8) statutory aggravating circumstance as not requiring knowledge on the part of defendants that the victim was a peace officer or other designated official engaged in the performance of his duties. The court further upheld the trial court's ruling with regard to one defendant's motion to suppress, finding that the plain view doctrine authorized the seizure of much of the contraband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's ruling refusing to make a pre-trial determination on whether defendants were entitled to immunity and remanded the case to the trial court for such a determination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Georgia Sentence Review Panel and an inmate, challenged the judgment of a Georgia trial court, which held that O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-6, authorizing the Panel to review and to reduce certain sentences imposed by the trial courts, was unconstitutional and granted the equitable relief sought by appellee district attorney. The district attorney had filed suit challenging the enforcement of the Panel's reduction of the inmate's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was prosecuted for murder and possession of a firearm during commission of a crime. She had entered into a plea agreement with the district attorney wherein she pled to the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter in exchange for a recommended sentence of 15 years. The sentence was imposed. Subsequently, the inmate filed a petition with the Panel seeking a reduction in her negotiated sentence, and the Panel reduced her sentence to eight years. Besides declaring &sect; 17-10-6 was unconstitutional, the trial court granted equitable relief against the enforcement of the Panel's reduction of the inmate's sentence. The court held that the trial court correctly concluded that &sect; 17-10-6 was unconstitutional since the Georgia General Assembly did not have the constitutional authority to divest the trial courts of their traditional jurisdiction over sentencing by creating a quasi-appellate tribunal, the Panel, to review and alter the otherwise lawful sentences imposed by those trial courts. The court did find that the trial court should have applied the ruling as to the unconstitutionality of former &sect; 17-10-6 prospectively only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court as to the unconstitutionality of the former statute but reversed the judgment insofar as it is made such ruling retroactively applicable to the inmate and to any defendant who, like she, may have applied and been granted a reduction in sentence by the Panel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of a Georgia habeas corpus trial court, which denied his petition for habeas corpus relief after a hearing. Defendant was convicted of aggravated stalking, aggravated assault, and other crimes after pleading guilty. An order of nolle prosequi was entered on a kidnapping with bodily injury charge. Defendant was sentenced to serve a total of 30 years, with 20 years in custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions related to his actions in stalking and harming his ex-wife. On appeal of the denial of his petition for habeas corpus relief, defendant only raised the issue relating to his sentence. Specifically, defendant challenged the condition that during his probation and parole, he was banished from all counties in Georgia, except one, namely Toombs County. The court did find that the habeas court erroneously addressed defendant's challenge as to his parole since the habeas court's attempt to control the parole condition was a violation of the constitutional provision regarding the separation of powers as the Board of Pardons and Paroles had executive power regarding the terms and conditions of paroles. As to the actual condition of banishment, the court held that defendant failed to show that the probation condition to remain in Toombs County was unreasonable or otherwise failed to bear a logical relationship to the rehabilitative scheme of the sentence pronounced. The court noted that the banishment was justified to protect the victim, defendant's ex-wife, from defendant's propensity for violence toward her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, in part, the judgment that addressed defendant's parole violation and remanded that portion of the judgment to the habeas court for it to enter an order granting the writ of habeas corpus as to that issue. The court affirmed the banishment condition imposed upon defendant as a condition of his probation.</SPAN></P>

Upon removal to the principal's office, appellant continued to be loud, boisterous, and disrespectful and refused to remain in the office. On appeal, appellant contended that &sect; 20-2-1181 was unconstitutionally vague as the terms disrupt and interfere were not defined. The court disagreed and concluded that the phrase &quot;disrupt or interfere with the operation of any public school&quot; contained words of ordinary meaning that gave fair notice as to the statute's application. The court refused to address appellant's contention that &sect; 20-2-1181 was overbroad since appellant never properly raised a constitutional challenge that the statute was overbroad at the trial court level. Therefore, appellant was procedurally barred from raising the issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A discretionary application for review was granted to petitioner, an employer's worker's compensation insurer, with regard to whether a Superior Court (Georgia) properly determined that a 1989 amendment to O.C.G.A. &sect; 34-9-13(e) violated Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; V, para. III. At issue was the benefits available to respondent widow. The insurer had suspended the widow's death benefits after paying for approximately 13 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">O.C.G.A. &sect; 34-9-13(e) placed a limit on the amount of time an insurer paid death benefits to a surviving spouse. At the time of the on-the-job death of the widow's husband, her death benefits were subject to the 1989 amendment, which provided that the benefit terminated at age 65 or after payment of 400 weeks of benefits, whichever occurred first. Subsequently, &sect; 34-9-13(e) was amended in 1990 and provided for the same termination periods but that the greater of the periods applied. After the suspension, the widow filed a motion for reinstatement and was eventually successful after arguing that the version of &sect; 34-9-13(e) applicable to her was unconstitutional because it incorporated a substantive change in the law not contemplated by the title of the act creating that change. The court agreed with the widow and the trial court, finding that the 1989 version of &sect; 34-9-13(e) was, in fact, unconstitutional since the legislation's object and title was to correct grammatical errors and modernize language, all non-substantive alterations. The change made to &sect; 34-9-13(e) was substantive since it greatly limited the availability of benefits to surviving spouses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A taxpayer filed a claim with the Georgia Department of Revenue in which it sought a refund for sales tax it paid on machinery repair parts. It claimed that the 1997 version of O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-8-3(34)(A) exempted such parts from sales tax. The trial court granted the Department's motion for summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals of Georgia reversed the trial court's decision. The state supreme court granted certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that for an exemption to be valid, it had to be expressed clearly and unambiguously. Beginning in 1951, machinery repair parts had been explicitly subjected to sales tax. The 1997 statute provided for an exemption for &quot;machinery, including components thereof, which is used directly in the manufacture of tangible personal property when the machinery is bought to replace or upgrade machinery in a manufacturing plant presently existing&quot; in Georgia. Nothing in this language created an explicit exemption from sales tax for machinery repair parts. At best, the language might have created an ambiguity that &quot;replacement components&quot; could include repair parts. In cases of ambiguity, however, a statute had to be interpreted in favor of a tax, not an exemption. Furthermore, in 2000, the legislature explicitly provided an exemption for machinery repair parts. Its intent that the exemption not take effect until 2000 was made evident from the stated purpose for the revision, the language of which showed that the legislature wished to eradicate any ambiguity caused by the 1997 statute and make it clear that the 1997 statute did not extend the exemption to machinery repair parts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a Georgia trial court, defendant pleaded nolo contendere to driving under the influence (DUI). He appealed, arguing that the exclusion of DUI offenses from the coverage of the First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 42-8-60 to 42-8-66, by O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-391(f) violated equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. II.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that the classification drawn by &sect; 40-6-391(f) was not one based on inherently constitutionally suspect criteria such as race, gender, or the exercise of fundamental rights. Thus, the classification would be upheld as long it was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Here, defendant argued that it was irrational for the legislature to afford the public greater protection from the danger of intoxicated drivers by making them ineligible for more lenient treatment under the First Offender Act while not providing the public with the same added protection from certain other offenders. The court stated that the equal protection argument boiled down to no more than the claim that the legislature had made a bad policy judgment about which offenders should be eligible for First Offender Act treatment. This argument was quintessentially political, not legal, and should be directed to the legislature and the governor rather than to the court. Defendant had not shown the absence of a rational relationship between the State's compelling interest in protecting the public's safety and the classification contained in &sect; 40-6-391(f).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an auto and hitch manufacturer, appealed the judgment of the trial court (Georgia) in favor of plaintiff widower, individually and as administrator of his deceased wife's estate. The widower's negligence suit asserted several products-liability claims, including design defects and various failures to warn. The widower cross-appealed the trial court's grant of partial summary judgment on certain claims against the hitch manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widower's wife was killed in a car crash. Two bolts on the trailer hitch on her vehicle impacted the fuel tank of her car, causing a fire. The wife's seat collapsed, pulling her head into the flames that had erupted in the back seat of her car. She died at the scene due to her exposure to the fire and from smoke inhalation. On appeal, the auto manufacturer asserted that the trial court erred by ordering the production of crash-test documents relating to prior litigation as it asserted that the documents were attorney work product. The court disagreed, finding that the trial court properly concluded that the widower demonstrated a substantial need for the requested documents since they documented past car-to-car crash tests conducted by the auto manufacturer on a line of vehicles that included similar fuel tank locations and performance as the vehicle that was being driven by the wife. The trial court did err by holding that the application of O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-9-67.1 to exclude the testimony of the widower's expert would have been unconstitutional but the admission of the expert's testimony was proper based on the hitch manufacturer's untimely motion seeking the exclusion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the widower as against the auto manufacturer. The court vacated, in part, the trial court's order denying the hitch manufacturer's motion to exclude the widower's expert testimony but, otherwise, affirmed the judgment in favor of the widower against the hitch manufacturer. The court dismissed the widower's cross-appeals.</SPAN></P>
