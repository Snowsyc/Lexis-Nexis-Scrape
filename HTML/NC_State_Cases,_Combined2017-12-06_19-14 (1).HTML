Additionally, based on the improper jury instruction, the appellate court found that the there was a reasonable likelihood the jury concluded the victim was asleep by a standard less than beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employees, on behalf of themselves and others, appealed an order of the Superior Court, Forsyth County (North Carolina), which denied their class action status in regard to their claims against defendant retailer. The trial court held that the proposed class was overbroad and infeasible, that individual issues would predominate over common issues, and that conflicts of interest existed amongst the members of the proposed class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employees filed a class action against the retailer based on widespread wage and hour abuses, including failing to record and pay for all of the time employees were required to work and failing to permit employees to take or complete lunch and rest breaks. The employees asserted, inter alia, actions for breach of contract and violations of the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act. The proposed class was comprised of all current and former hourly employees after a certain date. The record included affidavits and depositions of the employees who indicated they were not required to work off the clock, were not deprived of their rest and meal breaks, or worked off-clock and missed breaks for reasons other than pressure exerted by the retailer. The appellate court held that the trial court correctly determined that the employees failed to define a feasible class. Class members did not have written contracts. Thus, the contract and Wage and Hour Act claims would require individual determinations, including which putative class members were subject to the alleged violations and why those putative class members who worked off-the-clock did so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee appealed the order of the Guilford County Superior Court (North Carolina), which awarded a new trial to defendants, a police officer, individually, a police department, and a city. Defendants cross-appealed the trial court's denial of their motions for a directed verdict and JNOV. Plaintiff had brought a negligence, gross negligence, and willful and wanton misconduct suit and asserted respondent superior liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's suit arose from personal injuries he sustained as a result of the police officer allegedly driving too fast and causing plaintiff to propel forward into a squad car's metal screen, while the officer was attempting to avoid a collision. Plaintiff alleged that he had undergone three back surgeries and continued to suffer excruciating pain from the incident. A jury awarded plaintiff over a million dollars, but the trial court found that award excessive and granted defendants a new trial. The court held that the trial court erred by denying defendants' motion for JNOV on plaintiff's gross negligence claim, because the evidence presented by plaintiff established simple negligence only, not gross negligence. The court found that plaintiff's claim rested upon evidence that the officer drove 30 to 35 miles above the legal speed limit although he knew that plaintiff was not wearing a seat belt and he had to brake suddenly to avoid a collision. The court further held that the city's settlement of plaintiff's claims, via settlement agreements, did not cause a waiver of governmental immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment as to defendants' motion for JNOV on both the claim of gross negligence and also the constitutional claim. The court remanded the case to the trial court for entry of JNOV on both claims and dismissed plaintiff's appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Orange County Superior Court (North Carolina) convicted defendant of first-degree rape, two counts of first-degree sexual offense, and one count of taking indecent liberties with a minor. He appealed, arguing that the video tape of him committing sexual acts with the victim was not properly authenticated and that the trial court should have dismissed the charges under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-761 (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the trial court erred by admitting the video tape and still photographs taken from the video tape into evidence. The testimony of a state bureau of investigation agent established an unbroken chain of custody from the time the tape was found in defendant's residence. Further, there was ample testimony to establish the identities of defendant, the victim, and defendant's residence depicted on the video tape. There was also testimony establishing that defendant's camcorder was in working condition. Finally, there was sufficient evidence from the testimony regarding chain of custody to establish the video tape was not edited or altered, and that the same video tape seized from defendant's residence was the same video tape reviewed by the jury. Thus, the trial court properly admitted the video tape and the photographs taken therefrom into evidence. In addition, the appellate court did not construe &quot;detainer&quot; to include the arrest warrant served on defendant in his case. Thus, it found that the order for arrest served on defendant while in the county jail was not a detainer, and the provisions of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers were not applicable to defendant.</SPAN></P>

When the officer twice asked defendant where he was going, defendant gave inconsistent responses. The officer pointed out to defendant the inconsistency in his responses. Defendant looked down at the floor and said nothing. The officer asked for, and received, consent to search defendant's car. The officer found cocaine. The officer had probable cause pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. IV and N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 to stop defendant's vehicle as he witnessed defendant remove his seat belt while driving, a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-135.2A(a) (2004).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Lee County Superior Court (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon.

The court noted that the crimes of both attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and robbery with a dangerous weapon were governed by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-87(a) (2003). No abuse of discretion was found on the part of the trial court entering a prayer for judgment continued sua sponte because no presumption of vindictiveness in sentencing on the prayer for judgment following his successful appeal of another conviction was shown.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 15A-1444(a1), (a2), (e) (2003), defendant was not entitled to appeal the habitual felon status determination. This matter did not deal with sentencing, and defendant did not file an unsuccessful motion to withdraw the no contest plea. Defendant argued that his prior record level calculation was not supported by the evidence. Defendant's prior record level worksheet listed eight prior convictions. Of those eight convictions, defendant stipulated to three of them. With the exception to one of the remaining five convictions, the record was devoid of any proof of the remaining convictions. The State failed to prove any of the convictions as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.14(f) (2003). The trial court, therefore, erred in sentencing defendant as a prior record level III offender based on these prior convictions that were not proven at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient filed an action against defendants doctor and surgical center, alleging negligent medical treatment. The Robeson County Superior Court (North Carolina), granted relief from a previous denial of a motion to dismiss filed by the doctor and the surgical center and dismissed the patient's complaint for failure to comply with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j) (2004). The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint was filed after the appellate court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ.

The motion to dismiss argued that the claims were time barred since the complaint failed to contain the required certification, and was not amended to contain the certification until after the expiration of the 20-day extension granted for filing the suit. Initially, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss, since the patient was entitled to amend the complaint and have it relate back to the original filing. Later, after the North Carolina Supreme Court vacated the ruling that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j) (2004) was unconstitutional, the trial court granted the motion to dismiss. The appellate court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (2004) did not apply to interlocutory orders. Since the order denying the motion to dismiss was interlocutory, the trial court lacked the authority to grant relief from it. In any event, rights acquired under rulings that a statute was invalid were unaffected by a later decision that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's expert testified, and the State's expert agreed, that defendant could have an increased capacity if certain measures were taken, but the trial court did not order those measures. The victim had been teasing defendant at work about being retarded. Defendant was fired for having a gun at work, raped his former girlfriend and shot her in the legs, and then went back to work and shot the victim in the face. The girlfriend could properly testify under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for a felony drug offense. Many years after his release, he was charged and convicted for violating N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-415.1. Since defendant could legally possess a gun up until the statute was amended, which occurred several years after his release, he appealed. He argued that application of the current version of &sect; 14-415.1 to him violated ex post facto and bill of attainder provisions in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, and unconstitutionally stripped him of a vested right to possess a handgun without due process. The court found ex post facto did not apply because the date of the offense was six years after the current statute's effective date. Also, the amendment did not increase punishment or aggravate the prior felony conviction. There was no unconstitutional bill of attainder since defendant was not punished without a trial and since &sect; 14-415.1 was not enacted as a retroactive form of punishment. Finally, due process was not violated since the right to bear arms was subject to regulation and defendant's right was not completely abridged. Under &sect; 14-415.1, he could still legally possess guns in his home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his first assignment of error, defendant contended that the indictment for attempted murder was defective since it lacked allegations that defendant acted with the specific intent to kill, premeditation, or deliberation. The appellate court held that an indictment for attempted murder had to allege the necessary element of specific intent to kill. An indictment for attempted murder was not constitutional when it only complied with the language of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-144, a section that remained untarnished when applied as plainly intended. Defendant's indictment for attempted murder failed to allege that defendant acted with the specific intent to kill, and this omission was fatally defective. Defendant also argued that the evidence was not sufficient to survive his motion to dismiss. The evidence showed that defendant and the victim fought with each other before the shooting. The State also showed that after the fight, defendant sat in his truck and pointed a gun toward the victim's house. The victim identified defendant's voice as the voice he heard when the shooting occurred. The appellate court held that this was sufficient to defeat defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cause of action arose out of a five-day episode at the county detention center, during which, according to the former inmate, she was denied adequate medical treatment for a ruptured appendix despite her constant complaints of pain and pleas for assistance.

The court agreed with the trial court that defendants were persons under &sect; 1983 and were amendable to suit in their official capacities. The court also held that a reasonable officer would have had fair warning that ignoring an inmate's requests for medical care over two full days violated constitutional law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff injured party's inadequate medical treatment claim, the Robeson County Superior Court (North Carolina) denied defendant sheriff's and the detention officers' motions for partial summary judgment, contending primarily that (1) they were not &quot;persons&quot; amenable to suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and (2) the injured party's &sect; 1983 claims should have been barred by the doctrine of qualified immunity. The sheriff and the officers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the injured party's suit against the sheriff and the officers arising out of a five-day episode in the county detention center where she alleged that they ignored her requests for medical treatment, the trial court properly concluded that the office of North Carolina sheriff was a &quot;person&quot; under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because (1) the state constitution created the office of sheriff, but it included that provision within the article governing local governments; (2) state statutes characterized the sheriff's department as a local governmental entity; (3) there was no contention that the State would be potentially liable for any monetary judgment entered against the sheriff and the detention officers; and (4) the State did not have, with respect to the sheriff, the minimum degree of control required for Eleventh Amendment immunity. Thus, the sheriff's and the officers' motions for summary judgment on the injured party's &sect; 1983 claim were properly denied. Also, the officers acted with deliberate indifference to the injured party's medical needs, in violation of constitutional law. Thus, the officers' motion for summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity was properly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court dismissed the sheriff's and the officer's arguments the did not involve any claim of immunity. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among defendant's probation terms was one mandated by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1343(b2)(4) (2004) stating that defendant was not to reside in a household with any minor child. Defendant's probation officer arrested him for violating his probation because defendant was residing at his home with his wife and minor son. Defendant argued that &sect; 15A-1343(b2)(4) was overbroad, and that as applied to him, constituted an impermissible deprivation of his constitutional right to care and custody of his child without due process. The appellate court found that defendant was not losing custody of his child, but that his right of association with his child was being restricted for a probationary period of 36 months. Defendant was not prohibited from seeing his child or visiting his child, but simply prevented him from also residing in that home for the probationary period. Defendant had the potential, through good conduct, to shorten the term of his probation. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1343(b2)(4) was a valid condition on these facts, and did not violate defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on multiple counts of second-degree sexual exploitation of a minor. A jury convicted defendant of 43 counts of third-degree sexual exploitation of a minor. The Gaston County Superior Court (North Carolina) sentenced defendant to six consecutive terms of imprisonment of six to eight years, the sentences were suspended, and defendant was placed on supervised probation for 60 months. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss on grounds of double jeopardy and when it denied his motion to arrest judgment on all but one count. Defendant contended that the charges against him were multiplicitous. Defendant asserted that the possession of photos on a single hard drive constituted only one offense or, in the alternative, no more than five separate counts, one for each downloaded zip file. The appellate court concluded that the plain language of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-190.17A(a) supported multiple convictions, noting that, inter alia, each of the 200 photographs on defendant's computer had been opened and saved on the hard drive. Defendant also argued that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-190.17A(a), 14-1910.13 were unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed, declining to agree with defendant's argument that the statutes were overbroad because they extended to images of minors which did not require a live minor for their production and because they prohibited material that was accepted by the community. Finally, the appellate court found no merit in defendant's argument that he received consecutive probationary sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff pedestrian appealed a partial summary judgment order of the Durham County Superior Court (North Carolina), which dismissed the pedestrian's ordinary negligence claim.

The pedestrian also asserted claims for obstruction of public justice and spoilation of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pedestrian was struck by a police car driven by the police officer while he was en route responding to a call for backup. The pedestrian contended on appeal that the trial court erred by dismissing her claim of ordinary negligence. The court disagreed and held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-145 (2003) applied to the case and required the application of a gross negligence standard. Therefore, the trial court properly granted summary judgment on the pedestrian's ordinary negligence claim. Applying the gross negligence standard, the court held that the pedestrian failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to gross negligence on the part of the police officer responding to the backup call and, therefore, the city and the police officer were entitled to summary judgment on the gross negligence claim. The court noted that the pedestrian's own deposition testimony showed that she heard sirens and had violated the traffic signal and was outside of any designated crosswalk when she was struck by the police officer's car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying summary judgment and dismissing the pedestrian's ordinary negligence claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of driving while impaired (DWI) and driving while his license was revoked (DWLR), but found him not guilty of displaying a fictitious license plate. The Yancey County Superior Court (North Carolina) sentenced defendant to 120 days' imprisonment on the DWLR conviction and 19 to 23 months for a habitual DWI conviction based on his stipulation to the prior DWIs. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that it was reversible error for the trial court to refuse to give his requested instruction on the defense of necessity. The State asserted that the defense of necessity was inapplicable because DWI was a strict liability offense to which there were no common law defenses. Defendant offered evidence that he jumped into the moving truck and steered it to prevent the truck from hitting another car or a house and harming someone. Although the State argued that defendant's testimony was an elaborate fabrication, that argument presented a question of credibility that was solely within the purview of the jury. Thus, because the record contained substantial evidence of each element of the necessity defense, the trial court erred by failing to give the requested instruction. The appellate court also noted that an exhibit listing defendant's prior convictions was erroneously admitted where defendant stipulated that his license was revoked and that he knew that it was revoked, and the State offered no justification for admission of the prior convictions, as opposed to just the license suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of statutory rape in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-27.7A(a). The Superior Court, Rockingham County (North Carolina), sentenced defendant to 300 to 369 months in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to request that the jury selection be recorded because said failure precluded defendant from being able to appeal his Batson claim. The appellate court concluded while counsel's failure could amount to a deficient performance, it did not rise to the level of depriving defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Moreover, defendant failed to prove prejudice and the State proffered valid race-neutral justification for dismissing the two African-American jurors. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence because the evidence showed that the victim was two days older than 15-years old and thus, was more than 15 at the time of the alleged offense. The appellate court disagreed, noting that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-27.7A(a) specifically referred to a person who is 13, 14, or 15 years old. The appellate court concluded that because the statute did not qualify the age of the person, the minor described in &sect; 14-27.7A(a) must be one of those ages, not more or less than those ages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a telephone company. The taxpayer believed that the sale of two extraterritorial telephone companies was improperly attributed as income for its business activities in North Carolina for the 1991 tax year. The taxpayer had filed a petition with the ATRB, seeking relief from the statutory apportionment formula. The ATRB concluded that the taxpayer failed to overcome the presumption, as set forth in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-130.4(t)(4) (2003), that the statutory apportionment formula reasonably attributed to North Carolina that portion of the taxpayer's income earned in the state. The taxpayer based the trial court's appellate jurisdiction over the matter on N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-130.4(t)(6) (2003), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 150B-43 (2003), and other law. The court examined numerous statutes and held that there was no right to judicial review of a decision of the ATRB and, as a result, the taxpayer was required to pay the disputed tax and seek redress of the ATRB's decision by bringing an original action in the trial court. As a result, the trial court properly dismissed the action for its lack of subject matter jurisdiction to review a decision of the ATRB.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer contended, inter alia, that the county's color-blind policy perpetuated a racist structure that originated prior to the Civil War. The appellate court considered the taxpayer's appeal as a petition for writ of certiorari under N.C. R. App. P. 21 in order to address the merits of the arguments. The taxpayer did not assert that the county's schedule of values was erroneous or that the assigned values improperly reflected the subject properties' true values. The taxpayer did not sufficiently demonstrate that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-317 was intentionally or purposefully administered in such a way as to discriminate against it or others similarly situated under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that Article 27A was a civil and not a criminal remedy and did not violate the prohibitions against ex post facto laws. The appellate court further held that although defendant argued that the kidnapping was in furtherance of the larceny of the vehicle, N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pharmaceutical companies challenged an order from a trial court in New Hanover County (North Carolina), which certified plaintiff drug buyers' class action lawsuit that asserted various claims against them for allegedly inflating the price of a prescription drug. One of the companies appealed a separate order denying its motion to amend its answer to add a crossclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers filed an action alleging that the companies inflated the price of the drug, thus defrauding patients and insurance companies. The buyers brought claims of civil conspiracy, tortious conduct of another, common law fraud, and unfair and deceptive practices in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 75-1.1. They then moved for class certification under N.C. Gen. Stat., N.C. R. Civ. P. 23(a). The trial court granted class certification and the companies appealed. The buyers argued in response that the order was interlocutory and the appeal should be dismissed. The court found, as a result of the significant impact of the lawsuit, the importance of the issues involved, and the need for efficient administration of justice, it would exercise its discretion to reach the merits of the appeal. It then found that, according to the buyers' evidence, differences existed between North Carolina law and the law of the other jurisdictions on each substantive claim, thus, violating due process rights. Certification was improper without findings by the trial court on whether North Carolina's substantive law was sufficiently similar to other states' law to avoid due process problems.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying the one company's request to amend its answer. The court reversed the order certifying the class action and the court remanded the action for findings of fact on whether the state's substantive law was similar to other states' substantive law on the buyers' claims so that choice of the state's law would not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the child lived with and had been raised since the age of 10 months by the grandparents, and that the father, inter alia, was not active in the child's life and did not financially support his son. The child's therapist opined that it was not in the child's best interest to remove the child from the grandparents. The appellate court ruled that since the right of parents were constitutionally protected and paramount, a trial court was required to find that a natural parent was unfit before denying custody to that parent. While the trial court found that the acts of the father were tantamount to abandonment, neglect, abuse, or other acts inconsistent with his constitutionally protected interest, it also found that both parties were &quot;fit and proper&quot; to have custody. This finding of the father's fitness was inconsistent with the conclusion that he not be afforded his constitutional right to parent his child, and the case was remanded for new findings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The North Carolina State Bar filed a complaint against an attorney, alleging that he made false statements and filed a motion for improper purposes during a dispute with his neighbors, and made false statements to a client while representing her in a real estate case. The DHC found that the attorney's conduct constituted grounds for discipline, and it suspended his license to practice law for three years. The appellate court held that (1) the DHC was not an illegal and improper tribunal, and the attorney's rights to due process and equal protection were not violated because the charges against him were heard by the DHC; (2) the DHC properly denied the attorney's motion for separate hearings on the charges; (3) the DHC did not err when it considered evidence that the attorney had two misdemeanor convictions and had received a letter of warning from the State Bar when it determined an appropriate sanction after finding that the attorney was guilty of misconduct; and (4) N.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Town of Highlands, North Carolina filed actions against defendant property owners, seeking orders condemning title to the owners' property. The Superior Court for Macon County (North Carolina) denied the owners' motions to dismiss the actions, found that the owners' properties were being taken for a public purpose, and issued judgments vesting title to the owners' properties in the Town. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Town of Highlands adopted a series of resolutions finding that it was necessary to acquire rights-of-way for widening and improving a road and establishing an escrow fund for the project. Some owners who owned property that bordered the road did not want the road widened, and they sued the Town, seeking an order enjoining it from condemning their property. Shortly after those suits were filed, the Town filed condemnation actions against property owners who lived along the road. The appellate court held that (1) the escrow agreement was created to promote the public welfare and it was not an exclusive emolument that violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 32; (2) the record supported that trial court's judgment that the Town condemned the property owners' land for a public purpose; and (3) property owners who opposed condemnation did not have standing to challenge the manner in which the Town spent money that was in the escrow account because they were not parties to the escrow account or third-party beneficiaries of that account.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured woman appealed from the judgment of the Mecklenburg County Superior Court (North Carolina). The injured woman had brought a negligence suit against defendant police officer and was awarded $ 1.00 in damages. The police officer asserted governmental immunity and was dismissed from the lawsuit. The action continued against the injured woman's defendant insurance carrier based upon uninsured motorist's coverage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer was on duty at the time an automobile collision occurred wherein the injured woman allegedly received her injuries. The injured woman contended on appeal that the trial court erred by allowed the police officer to have been presented to the jury during jury selection and identified. The court found no error noting that the injured woman repeatedly identified the police officer in her direct testimony. The court further found no error in the trial court's exclusion of certain medical records from evidence, because evidence from the doctors who testified on the injured woman's behalf were allowed and records from doctors who did not testify were properly excluded. The court held that the trial court properly sustained the insurance carrier's objection to the injured woman's testimony as to her medical condition, because she was permitted to testify extensively regarding her pain and suffering. The court also upheld the award of damages, because the injured woman did not receive medical treatment for her alleged injuries until two years after the accident and had suffered a number of injuries prior to and subsequent to the auto accident with the police officer.</SPAN></P>

Prior to his release from custody there, he signed a form which indicated that he was going to live with his mother in South Carolina, and the proper authorities were so notified. Defendant subsequently moved to North Carolina but failed to register in North Carolina. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion to declare &sect; 14-208.11&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to residents of other states who moved to North Carolina. Defendant asserted that the statutory scheme, which imposed a duty to register with county authorities on certain sex offenders, violated the right to due process of out-of-state residents who moved to North Carolina by allowing them to have been convicted of the offense without notice of the duty to register. The court agreed and found that the statute provided neither actual nor constructive notice upon out-of-state offenders of the duty to register.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held the sexual offender registration statute was unconstitutional as applied to an out-of-state offender who lacked notice of his duty to register upon moving to North Carolina. The court reversed defendant's conviction for failing to register as well as his habitual felon conviction, which was dependent on the failure to register conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, inmates at a correctional institution, assaulted an officer and tried to escape. The appellate court found that the sentences imposed were within the statutory maximum, and thus did not violate Apprendi. Since one defendant failed to renew his pre-trial motion to sever his trial from his co-defendant at the close of all of the evidence, as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-927(a)(2), he waived his right to severance. Both defendants were charged with offenses arising out of the same set of operative facts. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the joinder of the trials. The record did not support the assertion that counsel had inadequate time to prepare for trial, or even that this was the basis upon which he sought a continuance. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 148-45(b)(2), to prove felonious escape, the State needed to prove that defendant was charged with a felony and had been committed to the custody of the Department of Correction. Testimony concerning the kind of crimes for which defendant was sentenced to prison was relevant and competent evidence. There was no error in sentencing defendant in the aggravated range on the assault conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder. He underwent several psychiatric evaluations with mixed results, but was deemed competent to stand trial. A jury returned a deadlock verdict. On retrial, defendant was again found competent to stand trial and was convicted for murder. Following appeal, the court remanded for a retrospective competency hearing (RCH), finding it was error for a hearing not to have been held on the day of trial where the prior competency evaluations had mixed results. The RCH hearing was conducted and defendant was found to have been competent at trial. The jury's verdict was sustained. Defendant appealed, arguing primarily that the trial judge should have been disqualified from presiding over the RCH, the RCH determination was improper, and he was incompetent to participate in the RCH. The court found defendant demonstrated no judicial bias and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1223 (2003) and N.C. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 3 did not mandate disqualification. Also, there was sufficient evidence that defendant was competent at trial where his trial attorney never raised the issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court Wake County (North Carolina) convicted both defendants of attempting to evade and defeat the imposition and payment of North Carolina Individual Income Tax for the four years, in violation of N.C.

Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued the trial court erred by denying their motions to dismiss the charges against them on constitutional grounds. As for defendants' contention that the taxation of compensation received for personal services was prohibited by the United States Constitution, the appellate court concluded that such contention was meritless as 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 61(a)(1) explicitly provided that gross income included compensation for services. In addition, defendants' contention that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-236 was so vague and general as to be ambiguous lacked merit. The appellate court concluded that &sect; 105-236 withstood the vagueness challenge. Finally, the appellate court found no error in the denial of defendants' motions to dismiss, as the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendants willfully attempted to evade or defeat a tax or its payment in violation of &sect; 105-236(7). In addition, the evidence tended to show that one defendant failed to file an income tax return for four years, despite the fact that his gross income exceeded his federal and state exemption allowances and necessitated that he file a return in each of those years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county assessed landfill use fees against the owners' campground, but the owners refused to pay. The county brought suit for the fees and placed a lien on the property. The owners paid the fees, but noted on the check that they were paying &quot;under protest&quot; per N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-381. The county then voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit with prejudice. The owners' subsequent request for a refund of the fees was denied, prompting the owners to bring a suit challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance allowing the county to charge the fees. The superior court granted the county's motion to dismiss and for summary judgment on a finding that the action was barred by res judicata of the prior litigation. The court found the claims in both actions were identical, but, instead of litigating the constitutionality of the fees in the prior action, the owners paid the fees in full, including interest. That required the county to dismiss its action with prejudice, thus adjudicating the constitutionality claim on the merits and triggering res judicata . Moreover, the landfill toll was a fee, and not a tax, so N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-381 did not apply to protect the owners' claims.</SPAN></P>

Thus, there was no error in denying defendant's motion. Defendant next argued that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay testimony of a witness the prosecution was unable to locate for trial. The appellate court concluded that the testimony was admissible under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 804(b)(5) since the prosecution made sufficient effort to located the witness and defendant failed to show he was prejudiced by the amount of notice he received regarding the testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor and another developer had a contractual relationship with a water service company, whereby the developers co-owned the backbone facilities that provided water and sewer service to their real estate developments.

On appeal, the court found that the Commission's conclusion that intervenor was a public utility was supported by substantial, competent, and material evidence. Therefore, intervenor was a public utility as defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 62-3(23)(a)(2) (2003) and was subject to regulation by the Commission. Further, there was no taking of intervenor's property, and impairment of the contract was reasonable and necessary to serve the public interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff gun club owner's suit against defendants, the State and officials, the trial court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-360(b) (2001) was constitutional, but that &sect; 14-360(a) was not. All parties appealed; the court of appeals reversed, finding the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The North Carolina Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case to the court of appeals for a decision on the merits of the underlying action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner conducted pigeon shoots during which caged feral pigeons were released so club members could shoot them. He argued that the animal cruelty statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-360, was unconstitutionally vague. The lawful taking of animals under the jurisdiction of the Wildlife Resources Commission (WRC) was not subject to &sect; 14-360; the WRC in turn had exempted from its jurisdiction the domestic pigeon (Columba livia). The owner argued that it was unclear whether the WRC's exemption applied to feral pigeons, which were also members of the Columba livia species. From expert affidavits and other materials, the court of appeals determined that while pigeons were commonly considered either &quot;domestic&quot; or &quot;feral,&quot; the two categories were genetically identical. A person of ordinary intelligence, without a scientific background, could not determine whether a particular pigeon was domestic or feral, or whether shooting that pigeon violated &sect; 14-360. Therefore, the statute was unconstitutionally void for vagueness in its entirety as applied to the owner's pigeon shoot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order finding a portion of the statute unconstitutional was affirmed, but its finding that a portion of the statute was constitutional was reversed. The case was remanded for entry of an order granting the owner's motion for summary judgment and permanently enjoining defendants from enforcement of the statute against him.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.11 (2003). Defendant's motion to dismiss was denied. A jury found defendant guilty as charged. The New Hanover County Superior Court (North Carolina) sentenced defendant to 20 to 24 months in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that the State was required to prove defendant's knowledge of the registration requirements. The appellate court held that, as a matter of statutory construction, the State was not required, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.11, to prove knowledge or intent. In addition, the detective's testimony that he advised defendant of the registration requirements when defendant initially registered was sufficient to satisfy due process. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the charges as a violation of the constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws. The appellate court found no error, as the United States Supreme Court had recently ruled that statutes such as N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.11 were not impermissible ex post facto laws. Finally, the appellate court held that, contrary to defendant's argument, he was properly sentenced under the statute as revised in 1998 since his violation of the registration requirement occurred three years after said amendment; the fact that his initial offense occurred prior to that time was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During defendant's criminal trial, defense counsel raised a Batson challenge as to the State's rejection of two prospective African-American jurors. After the State chose 12 jurors, only one of whom was African-American, the court sua sponte reconsidered the State's use of its peremptory challenges and ruled that the State expressed valid, articulable reasons for the exercise of peremptory challenges not based on race. Defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court erred by denying defendant's Batson challenges. While the State's challenge against one prospective African-American juror may have been based on a legitimate hunch, given the juror's location and knowledge of the area where the crime occurred, the basis for the challenge against the second prospective African-American juror was not sufficiently related to the case. Striking the potential juror from the jury pool because another attorney exercised a peremptory challenge against her in a previous unrelated case did not articulate a legitimate reason for the exercise of the peremptory challenge. Regardless, it did not rise to the level of demonstrating discriminatory intent. Thus, there was no error.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the child's complaint did not meet the statutory requirement for an illegitimate child to inherit from her father through intestacy. Absent N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-19(b) (2001), an illegitimate child had no right to inherit from his or her putative father. The complaint did not claim that the decedent was adjudged to be the child's father, or that the decedent acknowledged himself to be child's father in a written instrument which was duly executed and filed. A positive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test was not listed in the statute as a method of meeting the requirements to legitimate a child. Since the complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could have been granted, the appellate court did not to address whether the statute violated the child's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent taxpayer challenged a decision of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which reversed a tax review board's decision, ruled in favor of petitioner Secretary of Revenue (North Carolina), and found that the taxpayer was liable for use tax under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-228.10 (1997) (amended 1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, an insurance company, was issued a proposed notice of tax assessment for local use taxes. The taxpayer contested liability on the ground that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-228.10 (1997) (amended 1998) prohibited the assessment of local use taxes against insurance companies. The trial court held that the taxpayer was liable for the tax. The court affirmed. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-467(b), because the taxpayer enjoyed no exemption from the state use tax, it was liable for local use taxes. The court rejected the taxpayer's claim that its exemption derived from the gross premium tax system as set forth in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-228.5(b)(1) (2003). The legislature in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-228.10 (1997) (amended 1998) wished to codify a rule of law that local governments were entitled to tax the property of insurance companies. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105-467, 105-468 (2003), exemptions from local use taxes were explicitly limited to and made dependent on the existence of codified exemptions from the state sales and use taxes. Nowhere in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-164.13 were insurance companies exempted from state sales and use taxes. Thus, local use taxes were generally applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), found that defendant, an industrial size hog facility owner, committed several violations regarding hog waste, and water quality issues. The Duplin County Superior Court, North Carolina, refused to uphold penalties as determined by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC). The DENR appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facility owner was penalized for discharging waste into the waters of the State, continuously for eight days, resulting in a violation of the dissolved oxygen standard under N.C. Admin. Code tit. 2B .0211(3)(b). The DENR argued that the trial court erred in failing to uphold all eight violations, and holding the facility owner committed only one violation. The appellate court agreed with the DENRs argument. The provisions of the governing statute regarding such illegal discharges, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143-215.1(a)(6), were stated in the disjunctive and not in the conjunctive. The prohibition contained in &sect; 143-215.1(a)(6) applied to waste &quot;discharged to or in any manner intermixed with the waters of the State.&quot; Further, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143-215.6A (2001), provided for a penalty for each day that a violation continued. However, the trial court did not err in setting aside two penalties for violating notice requirements of he facility owner's permit because those two events, regarding problems with the waste management system, did not occur during the time period of the illegal discharges, and did not cause an emergency action plan to be initiated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court also held the trial court erred in reducing the investigative costs assessed to the facility owner, commensurate with the reduction in the amount of penalties assessed. The judgment of the trial court was reversed as to the number of violations, but the judgment of the trial court was affirmed as to setting aside the two penalties on notice issues where there was not a system failure requiring an emergency action plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the chief executive officers of state departments, agencies, institutions, and licensing boards, appealed a judgment from the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina). The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, the North Carolina School Boards Association and several boards of education, who sought a declaratory judgment that various monetary payments collected by defendants were subject to N.C. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued on appeal that none of the challenged payments fell within the purview of art. IX, &sect; 7 because they were remedial, not punitive, and thus could be used for purposes other than maintaining public schools. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The trial court correctly applied the three-year limitations period of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-52, rather than the one-year statute of limitations contained in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-54(2). However, contrary to the trial court's finding, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 115C-457.1 to 457.3, which created the civil penalty fund, was consistent with the intent and purpose of N.C. Const. art. IX, &sect; 7. Because art. IX, &sect; 7 required generally that revenue collected from civil penalties be used exclusively to support the state's public schools, but failed to unambiguously specify how that was to be accomplished, art. IX, &sect; 7 was not self-executing. It thus required legislation to give it effect, and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 115C-457.1 to 457.3 properly articulated the necessary details to effect the constitutional purpose. The court upheld some of the trial court's findings on the challenged monetary payments and reversed others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court's findings on whether the various monetary payments were subject to the constitutional provision at issue. The court, contrary to the trial court, upheld the constitutionality of the civil penalty fund. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to apply a three-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church was a religious body and owned approximately 50 acres of land. However, there was no building on the land. The commission found that the land was used for camping and recreational outings as well as observing nature, but further found that the church had failed to demonstrate that regular instruction or courses of study occurred on the land. The appellate court ruled that the tax exemption set out in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-278.3 applied only to buildings and the land necessary for their convenient use. The commission erred in requiring a building of worship for property to qualify for the exemption, since N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-278.3 only required that the building be used for religious purpose. Because the property had no buildings at all, it did not qualify for tax exemption under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-278.3. It was unnecessary to address the issue of the constitutionality of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-278.3 because the church did not suggest that its beliefs precluded using buildings &quot;for religious purposes&quot; other than worship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose out of an armed incursion into an apartment shared by several men and various family members. Four of the victims identified defendant in separate photo lineups conducted two weeks after the robberies. The court affirmed, holding that (1) the trial court correctly denied a motion to suppress the pretrial identifications because photo lineups, conducted separately, with pictures of others with similar looks to defendant, and with defendant's picture being randomly placed, were not overly suggestive; (2) testimony that defendant was arrested for driving a vehicle that was reported stolen was proper under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 404(b) (2001) because it was used to explain defendant's presence in the photo lineup, not to show a propensity for armed robbery; (3) defendant was properly charged with kidnapping under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-39(a) (2001) because forcing one victim to facilitate additional robberies after the victim was robbed at gunpoint exposed the victim to greater danger than that inherent in the armed robbery itself; and (4) the indictment properly alleged a violation of N.C.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners outdoor advertising companies sought review in the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) of respondent highway department's secretary's decision affirming the revocation of their permits for outdoor signs. The trial court granted the department's summary judgment motion, and the companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies said the trial court resolved a fact dispute by finding the words &quot;height&quot; and &quot;sign&quot; in N.C. Admin. Code tit. 19A, r. 2E.0203(1)(f) (June 2002) were used in their common sense. The appellate court held this was a question of law, the words had no technical meaning, and they were properly interpreted. The department could regulate the height of the companies' signs, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-130 (2001), and the department's regulation did not violate its authority, nor did the companies have to engage in unsafe behavior or violate other statutes to measure their signs. The regulation did not violate the companies' substantive due process rights, nor was it facially unconstitutional, as it was rationally related to legitimate state safety and aesthetic interests and was not subject to limits on aesthetics-based regulations. Laches did not bar the regulation's enforcement as the companies were not told their signs complied with the regulation, nor did they show various expenses would have been avoided absent the department's alleged delay. The companies' conclusory statements did not set forth specific facts to oppose a summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a student and her parents, appealed from a judgment of the Johnston County Superior Court (North Carolina), which entered summary judgment in favor of defendants, a county board of education, the North Carolina School Boards Association, the North Carolina School Boards Trust, and its self-funded trusts, in plaintiffs' action arising from injuries sustained by the student as she drove by a traffic control gate at her school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was driving her parents' car and a traffic control gate at her high school swung closed, causing damage to the car and injury to the student. Plaintiffs were paid for their property damage but medical expenses and other compensation was refused. Accordingly, they filed an action against defendants, alleging assorted counts arising from the incident. The trial court bifurcated the issues and granted summary judgment to defendants, holding that the board was immune from suit. The trial court had also denied plaintiffs' request to depose an individual. On appeal, the court found that denial of the deposition was proper, as no new evidence relevant to the limited issues of immunity and waiver thereof was obtainable. The court noted that the board and other defendants were immune from liability unless a waiver was found under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-42. To the extent of the excess insurance coverage it had obtained, the immunity was held to be waived. It was also error to grant summary judgment on plaintiffs' claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, as there was no immunity by the board under &sect; 1983. The board was immune from the punitive damages claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to defendants with respect to claims that were covered by the excess insurance policy and as to the violation of a civil rights claim. The court affirmed that summary judgment was proper as to all claims outside the limits of the insurance policy, and that punitive damages were not obtainable against defendants. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed a medical malpractice complaint on December 2, 1999. The alleged injury occurred on August 3, 1996. The original complaint was filed on the last day of a 120-day extension granted pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j). The complaint did not contain a certification regarding expert testimony as was required under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j). On December 13, 1999, the patient filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint contained the certification required under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j). On May 29, 2001, the patient voluntarily dismissed her claims without prejudice pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 41(a). On June 12, 2001, the patient re-filed the complaint. The fact that the patient obtained a 120-day extension prior to filing the first complaint did not deprive her of the right to take a voluntary dismissal without prejudice. The original complaint was timely filed. The first action was properly dismissed without prejudice and properly re-filed within one year. The patient's complaint was not barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

After an investigation began, defendant married the victim. After defendant and the victim proceeded with a divorce, the investigation was reinstated. Defendant was subsequently convicted by a jury of statutory rape, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-27.7A, and sentenced to 202 to 252 months, by the Davie County Superior Court (North Carolina). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before trial, defendant requested a continuance, asserting that without additional time to prepare he would be denied the effective assistance of counsel. The motion was denied. The appellate court found that trial counsel was appointed about a year and a half prior to trial. There was no evidence that defendant was unavailable until he fled the country. He was subsequently taken into custody in Australia and returned to the United States. The appellate court found that defendant failed to establish that he was deprived of any constitutional right by a lack of a reasonable opportunity to consult with his attorney in preparation for trial. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, including the required six-year age difference. The sentencing statute was not unconstitutional. The statutory scheme, providing a more severe penalty for younger victims, reflected a rational legislative policy, and was not disproportionate to the crime. Defendant's claim that he did not have sufficient notice of the severity of the sanctions for the offense was found to be without a legal basis. Ignorance of the law was not a valid defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homeowner sued appellee city in the Craven County Superior Court (North Carolina) for the destruction of her home in violation of her due process rights under the North Carolina Constitution and for trespass. The homeowner and the city moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city. The homeowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner's house was in a severe state of disrepair and boarded up. The city demolished the house without giving the homeowner notice or an opportunity to be heard prior to the demolition. A lien for the cost of demolition was placed on the property. On appeal, the court found that the city did not follow the procedural requirements under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 160A-441 through 160A-450 (2001), but instead, demolished the house pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-193, without providing the homeowner with notice or a hearing. However, the record did not establish that the condition of the house posed an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public. Therefore, the city did not have the authority under &sect; 160A-193 to summarily demolish the house. Because it was undisputed that the city did not comply with the procedural requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 160A-441 through 160A-450, the city was liable in damages to the homeowner, as a matter of law, for demolishing her house.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment entered in favor of the city was reversed; the case was remanded for entry of summary judgment in favor of the homeowner; and the case was further remanded for a trial on the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to felony death by motor vehicle, and felonious hit and run. The convictions were consolidated, and minimum and maximum prison terms were imposed. The trial court then suspended the sentence and placed him on supervised probation. The trial court ordered him to serve an active term of 90 days in the county detention facility. The judgment also provided that if he served an active sentence, he was required to obey the rules and regulations of the department of correction. Thereafter, a violation report was filed alleging he violated his probation while serving the active 90-day term. Following a hearing, the trial court activated his sentence after finding he willfully committed the alleged violations. After his probation was revoked and his sentences were entered, the appellate court found statutory law subjected defendant to department of correction rules and regulations even though he was serving his time in a county detention facility; defendant willfully violated the prohibition against the usage of threatening or abusive language; and his claim that his constitutional rights were violated was waived because he did not raise it in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorneys filed a lawsuit claiming that the Indigent Defense Services Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-498 et seq., (2001), and the creation of the Office of Indigent Defense Services (IDS) were unconstitutional. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The trial court denied the attorneys' motion but allowed appellees' motion for summary judgment. The attorneys appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Creation of the IDS did not violate the North Carolina Constitution's central principle of separation of powers under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Attorneys failed to meet their burden to show that the Act was constitutionally unsound. No provision of the state constitution existed that committed the power and responsibility of appointing and compensating attorneys for indigent criminal defendants to any particular branch of the state government. The attorneys contended that the appointment of counsel for indigent defendants was within the inherent powers of the judiciary. The court disagreed. As, under N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, the judiciary retained the inherent power to supervise and discipline the attorneys before it, the Act was not inconsistent with the separation of powers doctrine mandated by the North Carolina Constitution. There was no genuine issue of material fact and appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In bifurcated trials in Buncombe County Superior Court (North Carolina), a jury found defendant guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-100 (2001) and guilty of the status of habitual felon in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-7.1 (2001). Defendant received a sentence of 90 to 117 months and appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence supported conviction for obtaining property by false pretenses in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-100 (2001) where it was shown someone else owned calipers pawned by defendant. Where the essence of defendant's claim was not that the State failed to appoint counsel but, rather, that the counsel procured by defendant provided ineffective assistance by failing to appear, this did not equate to a failure to appoint counsel and was ineffective as a collateral attack on a prior conviction. Under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-7.1 (2001), a 19-year-old conviction could be a predicate for habitual felon status. The sentence imposed under the habitual felon laws was not so grossly disproportionate as to result in constitutional infirmity. Defendant was not sentenced for 90 to 117 months in prison because he pawned a caliper obtained by false pretenses for approximately $ 20. He was sentenced to that term because he committed multiple felonies over a span of almost 20 years and was a habitual felon.</SPAN></P>

Defendant cut the woman's hands several times as she sought to protect her face. The woman fled from her car. A police officer later found defendant in the back of a car with a gold necklace and a cell phone that belonged to the woman, as well as a box cutter and a bloody jacket and hat. On appeal, the court found that (1) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to continue, and defendant failed to show any prejudice as a result of the alleged error because the State dismissed a habitual felon indictment and defendant was sentenced solely on the substantive charges against him; (2) the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that a box cutter was a deadly weapon; and (3) defendant failed to show that his trial counsel was deficient during jury selection, in failing to object to the prosecutor's accurate statement that the evidence was uncontroverted, and in not calling defendant's nephew as a witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree sexual offense and taking indecent liberties with a child. At trial, a pediatrician testified that she had found physical evidence that was consistent with trauma and that could have been caused by attempted anal penetration. She also testified as to the child's behavioral changes since the alleged abuse. On defendant's appeal, the court found no error. The court first held that the short-form indictments against defendant were valid. The pediatrician's expert opinion that the child had been sexually abused had the requisite foundation given the physical examination and the child's medical history. The child's statements to the pediatrician regarding defendant's abuse were not hearsay because they were not offered for their truth but to illustrate the information collected for a diagnosis. The pediatrician's recommendation that the child have no further contact with defendant and that the legal system relied on medical opinions did not constitute an opinion as to guilt. Finally, it was not error to convict defendant even where the trial court instructed the jury that more than one sexual act could comprise an element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

However, the SPC reversed the ALJ's decision and reinstated the employee's dismissal. The appellate court held that (1) the dismissal letter which the NCDHHS gave the employee adequately explained the reasons for her dismissal; and (2) the SPC's conclusion that there was just cause to terminate the employee based on evidence that she engaged in unacceptable personal conduct was supported by substantial evidence in the record, and the trial court did not err by affirming the SPC's order upholding the NCDHHS's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a former employee with the state department of corrections (DOC) and department of transportation (DOT), appealed from an order of the Wake County Superior Court dismissing his claims alleging multiple state and federal claims arising from the alleged disclosure and dissemination of the contents of his state personnel file.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the employee alleged, inter alia, that the trial court erred in dismissing his claim for violation of his federal and state procedural due process rights contending that defendants inserted &quot;false and stigmatic information&quot; into his personnel file, the dissemination of which had deprived him of occupational liberty. The court of appeals noted that under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 126-22, the employee's legitimate expectation of continued confidentiality for his state personnel file was not the kind of &quot;monetizable&quot; property interest generally protected by procedural due process. However, the court of appeals determined that the trial court had erred in dismissing the employee's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim for injunctive relief against individual defendants in their official capacities. Further, the court of appeals found that where the employee alleged that under color of state law, defendants had released his confidential personnel file to the media, and thus the public, while the files of other similarly situated employees were not released, he had successfully stated a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim for violation of the Equal Protection Clause under the &quot;class of one&quot; theory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Insofar as the order appealed from dismissed the former employee's claims for injunctive relief based on federal substantive due process and equal protection violations, a breach of contract claim, and various common law tort claims, it was reversed; otherwise, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an abortion performed by the doctor, the patient incurred damage to her uterus and bowel that caused hemorrhaging. The issue was whether the trial court erred in dismissing the patient's medical malpractice claim based on her alleged non-compliance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j)'s (2001) &quot;willingness to testify&quot; requirement. The patient's witness never affirmatively denied giving his opinion to the patient's attorney over the telephone. On the contrary, the witness testified in terms of probabilities because he could not immediately remember the substance of a telephone conversation that had occurred two years earlier. After having time to reflect on that conversation, the witness's affidavit was filed in which he recalled stating his willingness to testify on the patient's behalf prior to her lawsuit being initiated. Thus, there was no clear contradiction by the witness, a non-party, in his deposition and later filed affidavit. Accordingly, the trial court erred in dismissing the patient's medical malpractice claim. The appellate court determined that the trial court did not err in dismissing the patient's unfair and deceptive trade practices claim.</SPAN></P>

The district court agreed and dismissed the action. The superior court affirmed. The instant court stated that the relevant prong as to whether a statute violated the Establishment Clause was whether it fostered an excessive entanglement with religion. The court was required to determine whether the district court properly determined that the university was a religious institution in accordance with the United States Supreme Court's Larkin decision. If it was, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 74E, as applied to the university, was unconstitutional. The dispositive issue was the sufficiency of the evidence to support a determination that the university was a religious institution. The record revealed sufficient evidence to support the superior court's determination that the university was a religious institution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from a judgment of the Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina), which denied a motion to amend in order to add the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) as a party, and which granted defendant DMV's motion to dismiss the complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12101 et seq., prohibited the DMV from charging a fee for a handicapped placard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs originally filed an action in federal court which was dismissed, affirmed on appeal, and further appeal was sought by the United States Supreme Court. In the interim, plaintiffs filed the declaratory judgment action which challenged the DMV's practice of charging a fee for handicapped parking placards as being an unlawful surcharge in violation of the ADA. Plaintiffs sought to add the Commissioner as a party defendant. The trial court stayed the action pending completion of the federal action. Thereafter, the trial court denied the motion to amend and granted the DMV's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the State had sovereign immunity from suit which had not been waived. The attempt to amend the complaint to add the Commissioner lacked merit because the ADA could not be brought against individuals, and amendment was denied on the ground that it would change the legal issues from the immunity of the State from suit to the possible entitlement to a prospective injunction on the merits. Lastly, the court held that the fee did not violate the ADA or 28 C.F.R. &sect; 35-130(f).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction of the offense of murder in the first degree based on the application of the felony murder rule. Defendant also challenged the imposition of the sentence of life imprisonment. Defendant asserted that the short-form indictment violated his constitutional rights, that the trial court erred when it permitted the State to make racially based peremptory challenges to the jury, and that the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of felony murder. The court found no error, and rejected defendant's assertion that the short-form indictment was unconstitutional. The court found that while defendant was African-American and the victim was white, there was no evidence that the prosecutor made any racially motivated statements. The court determined that the trial court was able to assess the credibility of the prosecutor's reasons for the use of his peremptory challenges, and found that its judgment was not clearly erroneous.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer alleged that after he refused to violate policy, the chief retaliated by assigning him unfavorable duties; he ultimately resigned and started a business. In his first suit, a federal court dismissed all federal claims. As he failed to respond to defendants' motion to dismiss with evidence that his claims were not time-barred and that the city had waived sovereign immunity, his first six claims against the city and the other defendants in their official capacities were properly dismissed. Claims against defendants as individuals were properly dismissed: North Carolina did not recognize &quot;constructive wrongful discharge&quot;; that a manger spoke negatively about the officer to a client was not so &quot;extreme and outrageous&quot; as to support an IIED action, and did not establish malice to support the claims of interference with contract and advantage. Though the due process and equal protection claims were not barred by res judicata, as they were based on different facts than the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims dismissed in federal court, the allegations were insufficient to establish that the city's actions were sufficiently arbitrary and capricious as to support these claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the retiree was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, he received retirement based on disability. Subsequently, the county adopted a new retroactive policy that required county employees to have completed 20 years of continuous employment in order to receive benefits. The retiree did not have the requisite 20 years of service to qualify for benefits under the new policy. The appellate court held that although the retiree's tort claims could be dismissed based on sovereign immunity, his contract and constitutional claims could not. The county was deemed to have &quot;consented&quot; to suit for contract claims. Sovereign immunity did not protect the county from suits brought directly under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 where the claim was caused by the county's official policy. Thus, the trial court properly denied the motion to dismiss the retiree's complaint in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion to suppress was granted and on appeal by the State, the court reversed the suppression. The officer testified that he had &quot;standing permission&quot; to set up whichever type of checkpoint he decided upon, in his own unrestrained discretion. The court reversed the trial court's holding that such delegation of authority violated the Fourth Amendment. The court concluded that even though there was no written plan adopted by the police department relative to the checkpoint, there was a sufficient showing that the random license check was not an unreasonable detention. Accordingly, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The corporation requested over $ 10,000 in damages for the alleged due process violation. The appellate court held that monetary damages were not recoverable for a violation of procedural due process rights. Further, since Charlotte, N.C., City Ordinance 966, &sect; 14-226 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff non-clinical providers of business services to dentists sued to challenge the validity of N.C. Admin. Code tit. 21, r. 16X.0101, which was proposed by defendant state board of dental examiners and adopted into law by defendant state rules review commission. The Wake County Superior Court (North Carolina) granted defendants' motion to dismiss under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1-12(b)(6), 1A-1-12(c). The providers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rule 16X.0101 (1) prohibited certain business services that might control the business activities or clinical/professional services of a dentist or a dental entity, (2) contained exemptions, and (3) provided for review of management agreements. The providers contended the rule had a substantial economic impact on their businesses. The appeals court agreed that the providers had failed to exhaust all administrative remedies and that the rule was not unconstitutional. The providers had not sought relief under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 150B-4, 150B-20 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 150B-1 et seq., prior to filing the suit; such relief was still recognized and the providers did not allege and prove that pursuing such relief would be futile by merely anticipating that the commission would not afford such relief. The Rule did not violate substantive due process. Under the rational relationship versus strict scrutiny test, the rule related to a legitimate governmental interest: the protection of the public health and welfare by preventing unlicensed persons from controlling the practice of dentistry was not effected by means that outweighed the public benefit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general partner of the partnership was president and chief executive officer of the corporation's predecessor. He was issued 2,000,000 shares of unrestricted stock, which were transferred to the partnership. The general partner later resigned positions and surrendered 750,000 shares. The legends of any subsequently issued shares did not contain restrictions. The general partners filed individually for bankruptcy. The partnership's shares of the predecessor were listed by the general partners as personal property, and they stated that the shares were conditioned on a restricted stock agreement. The corporation cancelled the partnership's 1,000,000 shares. The trial court erred in applying judicial estoppel against the partnership. The general partner's statement at the bankruptcy hearing that the stock was restricted was contrary to his claim in the instant case. An issue of fact remained whether the general partner's statements at the bankruptcy hearing were individual statements or whether they were made as general partner under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 59-39(a) (2001). There was also no evidence that the general partner intentionally misled the bankruptcy court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's three children testified that, while their mother was away from home, defendant engaged in improper touching of their private parts.

There was substantial evidence to support the essential elements of first-degree sexual offense under &sect; 14-27.4(a). All three children testified to the egregious acts committed by defendant. Evidence that defendant raped or fondled his children was not evidence of &quot;prior bad acts,&quot; but rather evidence tending to show that defendant committed the crime of first-degree sexual offense. Much of the evidence defendant sought to introduce was simply an attempt to re-litigate an earlier civil trial and was irrelevant to the issues before the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mobile home park, originally approved for 440 spaces, was a non-conforming use. Under stricter sewage treatment rules, the landowner could only service 140 spaces. The landowner wanted to expand its sewage treatment capacity, but the county amended its zoning ordinance to provide this would expand a nonconforming use. The appellate court held the landowner's permissible use was 140 spaces, due to the sewage treatment limits, and increasing capacity would impermissibly expand a nonconforming use. The landowner had no vested right to the park's full occupancy, as it had neither the county's permission nor a valid permit. Preventing the park's expansion was consistent with the state's policy against expanding nonconforming uses. The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources' authority to regulate wastewater treatment systems did not preempt the county's amendment, which clarified impermissible expansion of a nonconforming use. The landowner's substantive due process and equal protection rights were not violated, as legislating against expanding nonconforming uses was legitimate, and the ordinance had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-270.1 et seq. (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board successfully argued that the trial court erred in concluding that the Board violated the psychologist's due process and statutory rights. The appellate court held that the psychologist failed to meet his burden of demonstrating bias by the Board members. The Board did not impermissibly commingle prosecutorial, investigative, and adjudicative functions. The assessment of costs was proper. The Board's findings of an improper relationship between a patient and the psychologist were supported by substantial evidence.  N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-270.15(a)(10), (11), and (20) (2001) were violated by the psychologist's entry into the relationship with his patient. The psychologist also violated the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and the Code of Conduct. The trial court properly refused to render a declaratory judgment as to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-270.15(a)(10) (2001). The statute was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. There was no evidence that the objective of the American Psychological Association (APA) in developing its standards was guided by legislative considerations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the lumber company decided to construct a wood chip mill, it met with representatives of the state agency who told the lumber company that the only permit it would need for the new facility was a general stormwater permit. During construction, the state agency inspected the lumber company's mill and sent a letter revoking its permit because the lumber company did not have an individual permit to discharge wastewater into the wetlands. The appellate court held that the state agency did provide adequate constitutional due process to the lumber company. The lumber company was never unconstitutionally deprived of its permit as a result of the state agency failing to provide proper due process. In fact, it was through due process provided by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 150B (1999) that the lumber company's permit was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board found that the therapist knew or should have known his actions were subject to discipline. The therapist argued that as the events at issue occurred in 1990 and 1991, but the Board did not notify him of any complaint until 1996, the suspension was barred by laches. The appellate court disagreed, as the therapist showed no specific instance of prejudice to his case from the delay. Noting that the potential harm to the public from the therapist's conduct with his patients conduct was obvious, the appellate court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-270.36(7), (9) were not unconstitutionally vague and were sufficiently specific to provide the Board with the authority to determine that the therapist's actions violated acceptable standards of practice. That the conduct was consensual, and was not explicitly prohibited by any rule in the code of ethics for physical therapists, was immaterial. The evidence, including testimony by an expert witness and the therapist's own admissions, supported that Board's finding that the therapist knew or should have known that his actions were wrong. There was no showing that the Board acted in bad faith, unfairly, or without judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants violated Transylvania County, N.C., Sign Control Ordinance &sect;&sect; 16-106, -108 by, inter alia, erecting two signs without first applying for a permit.

Defendants argued on appeal that (1) the county did not properly follow the procedures of N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant perpetrated the robbery under the doctrine of recent possession. The entire contents of the victim's purse were recovered from defendant's possession upon his attempt to make a purchase using the victim's credit card. The stolen goods were located in a briefcase that defendant carried, thereby allowing the inference that defendant was aware that he possessed the stolen goods, and had both the power and intent to control them. The State also presented sufficient evidence that defendant used a dangerous weapon to perpetrate the robbery. The victim testified that she was hit with a firm, rigid object. Further, defendant's constitutional rights were not abridged, as the offenses of financial transaction card theft and robbery with a dangerous weapon each required proof of an essential element which the other did not. Next, the statutory requirements for a clear, unequivocal, knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of defendant's right to counsel were not sufficiently established. Finally, defendant waived his right to be present in the courtroom by his conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence, the Forsyth County Superior Court (North Carolina) convicted defendant of trafficking by possession of cocaine pursuant to N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the information in the affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause and to support the issuance of the search warrant for the apartment in question. Defendant failed to set forth any authority to support the proposition that failure to specify from whom the informant bought the drugs was material. Based upon the fact that the police officers were executing a warrant to search for narcotics which could be easily disposed of, the delay of six to eight seconds did not violate defendant's statutory and constitutional rights. Therefore, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. Further, the undisputed evidence indicated that the total weight of the cocaine mixture was 30.5 grams. Thus, there was no evidence of the lesser-included offense of trafficking by possession of less than 28 grams of cocaine, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's request for an instruction on the lesser-included offense. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to warrant an instruction on the doctrine of acting in concert, and the instruction itself correctly stated the law.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the language of &sect; 122C-62(b)(4) required court approval via a court order prior to not guilty by reason of insanity patients being granted visits outside the custody of a facility. Visits outside the custody of the facility included unsupervised passes or visits on the hospital premises in addition to off-campus visits. Thus, the patient's argument was overruled. The patient also argued that the trial court's exercise of jurisdiction in determining whether respondent should have unsupervised passes on the premises violated his right to due process. The appellate court held that the patient did not have a protected liberty interest in obtaining unsupervised passes. The patient's right to equal protection was not violated, as the distinction between NGRI patients and other involuntarily committed patients was not a suspect classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff candidate filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking to have N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-59 declared unconstitutional, as applied to primary elections of district court judges, and seeking a declaration that district court judges should be elected in nonpartisan elections. The State filed a motion to dismiss. The Cumberland County Superior Court, North Carolina, dismissed the action. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A registered member of the opposition party was appointed to the position of district court judge and was seeking election to that position at the time of the party primary. There were no other candidates running for the position in either the primary or the general election. Thus, the winner of the primary would have automatically won the general election. Plaintiff argued that: (1) the trial court erred in shifting the burden of proof to plaintiff from the State; and (2) N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-59 was unconstitutional, as it prevented him from voting in the primary. The appellate court held that: (1) while the State had the burden of demonstrating that the action should have been dismissed, the court had not shifted that burden by inviting plaintiff to submit case law in support of his claim; and (2) the fact that there was only one candidate for the general election was not the result of any action of the State, but was the failure of parties other than the Democratic party to field any candidates. Plaintiff's rights were not violated by his exclusion from the opposition primary, as the State could legitimately allow political parties to close their primaries to nonmembers.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court did not review defendant's first assignment of error because the issue was not preserved for appeal, and defendant waived plain error review by failing to allege in his assignment of error that the trial court committed plain error. Further, the appellate court did not address defendant's second assignment of error because it was not properly preserved for appellate review. Finally, the appellate court determined defendant's self-defense claim had to fail because defendant, in failing to heed the principal's warnings not to exit the building, engaged in and continued a difficulty with the principal that required the principal to undertake some reasonable force to protect defendant's safety and to prevent defendant from leaving the school premises.</SPAN></P>

Following a capital sentencing proceeding, the Robeson County Superior Court (North Carolina) sentenced him to, inter alia, two consecutive life terms. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered the victims' house, raped one of them, killed them both, and set fire to their house. Defendant claimed error in the trial court's unrecorded private discussions with prospective jurors. The appellate court held that, as the record did not indicate that any action was taken by the trial judge as a result of these discussions, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As the refusal of the United States Postal Service to deliver juror summonses to rural residents did not affect the jury venire in any way, the trial court's denial of a mistrial on that basis was not an abuse of discretion. The State was not required to indict defendant for burglary in order to use burglary as the underlying felony in the felony murder charges; thus, any variance between the burglary indictment and the jury charge on burglary did not prevent the State from using burglary as the underlying felony. Defendant was improperly convicted of first-degree arson, as the indictment only alleged elements of second-degree arson, and was not sufficient to put him on notice that he might be tried for first-degree arson and to allow him to prepare a defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment against defendant for first-degree arson was vacated and the case was remanded with instructions that judgment be entered against defendant for second- degree arson and that defendant be sentenced accordingly.

At the return hearing, the trial court found the mother failed to prove the father committed any acts of domestic violence and dismissed the mother's complaint. Later, the trial court entered an order dismissing the father's counterclaim. On appeal, the father argued the trial court erred in: (1) holding the issues raised in the father's counterclaim were moot, (2) denying the father's counterclaim that the Domestic Violence Act was unconstitutional, and (3) refusing to consider the father's declaratory judgment counterclaim even if it was moot. The appellate court held an actual controversy existed between the mother and the father at the time the father filed his answer and counterclaim for a declaratory judgment, and at the time of the return hearing, in order to determine the constitutionality of the Domestic Violence Act. Accordingly, the appellate court concluded the father was entitled under the Declaratory Judgment Act, N.C. Gen.

The board entered an order upholding the officer's determination that the owner's use of a sawmill violated a zoning ordinance. The owner sought review in the Superior Court of New Hanover County (North Carolina). The superior court affirmed the board's decision. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner purchased a sawmill and used the sawmill to mill lumber on his residential property. The city annexed the owner's property, which then became subject to the city's zoning ordinance. A code enforcement officer sent a notice of zoning violation to the owner, advising him that use of the sawmill violated a zoning ordinance. The appellate court found that the superior court did not err in concluding that owner was not entitled to raise constitutional objections to the zoning ordinance in the proceeding. Further, there was competent, material, and substantial evidence in the record to support the board's conclusion that, under the particular circumstances of the case, the owner's use of the sawmill was not of a nature that was customarily incidental and subordinate to the primary residential use of the property, and, therefore, violated the zoning ordinance. Finally, because there was competent, material, and substantial evidence in the record to support the board's determination, the admission of other arguably incompetent evidence at the hearing did not deprive the owners of a fair hearing.</SPAN></P>

The injured parties' punitive damages award was reduced under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1D-25 (1999), capping such damages. The appellate court held &sect; 1D-25 was constitutional under the North Carolina Constitution, as it did not deprive the injured parties of their jury trial right, because their right to punitive damages was not a property interest as to which they had a jury trial right. The legislature could limit such damages. The statute did not violate the constitution's open courts guarantee, nor did it take property or infringe on the right to enjoy the fruits of one's labor. The statute did not violate due process because it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute's limits were correctly applied per injured party, as the punitive damages award was to be compared to the total compensatory damages award, which was individual as to each injured party. This award was not grossly excessive. The injured parties did not show how the retailer's defense of the action was frivolous or malicious, so they were not entitled to attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two property owners petitioned the city to have their properties rezoned.

Laws ch. 84, &sect; 1(e). A public hearing was held on the petitions, and the city passed the two challenged ordinances. On appeal, plaintiffs argued that the conditional zoning was quasi-judicial in nature, rather than legislative, and unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the city's decision to adopt the ordinances rezoning the two parcels of land was a single procedure, constituting legitimate conditional zoning, and was therefore a proper legislative act. Furthermore, the action was entirely consistent with 2000 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 84. The zoning ordinances were adopted in accordance with a small area plan, with goals that included: creating a greater mixture of land uses; planning for future mass transit service; developing pedestrian improvements; and developing a public gathering space and a network of green spaces. The city did not violate its delegated zoning authority.</SPAN></P>

The board held closed hearings solely to consult with its attorney on matters within the scope of the attorney-client privilege, and the owner failed to show any prejudice from these closed meetings. Contrary to the owner's assertions, the findings and conclusions of the board were supported by the evidence: (1) the inspector found code violations in each unit he inspected; (2) estimates of the cost of repairs and the value of the units supported the board's finding that 39 units were &quot;deteriorated&quot; and had to be brought up to code, and its finding that the cost to repair 15 &quot;dilapidated&quot; units exceed 65 percent, requiring their demolition. The ordinances were not impermissibly applied retrospectively, as they were effective no later than 1989, and when the owner acquired the units in 1992 it was aware that they did not comply with the code. The board could not be estopped by prior inaction from enforcing the code.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his requested instruction on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. The appellate court found that the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of first degree murder, second degree murder, and voluntary manslaughter. The evidence was inconsistent with involuntary manslaughter, which involved a killing resulting from culpable negligence or from an act not amounting to a felony. The evidence of the time and acts involved did not support a jury instruction on the heat of passion brought about by a sudden provocation which would naturally and reasonably arouse the passions of an ordinary man beyond the power of control. Defendant testified that following the attempted abduction, he was upset but not furious. More than sufficient evidence was presented to indicate that defendant could have been the aggressor in the fight resulting in the victim's death. The disclosure of the officer's typewritten report 20 days prior to trial did not violate the statutory requirement of timely discovery. Defendant failed to object to the first degree murder instruction on constitutional grounds during the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant debtors sued appellees, a creditor and repossession company, in the Lincoln County Superior Court (North Carolina) regarding the repossession of the debtors' automobile. The trial court granted, in part, the creditor's summary judgment motion, certifying its order as final for purposes of appeal, and the debtors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtors' automobile was repossessed by self-help. The appellate court held the trial court correctly certified its summary judgment on the creditor's wrongful conversion and/or repossession and the constitutionality of the statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 25-9-503 (1999), as final, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (1999). The repossession, occurring without confrontation, did not breach the peace because (1) it happened in the early morning hours from the debtor's non-enclosed driveway, (2) the debtor expressly consented to it, (3) the debtors' neighbor, awakened by the repossession, did not confront the repossessor, (4) neither the debtors' house nor any other enclosure was entered, and (5) there was no allegation or evidence of any form of deception by the creditor. The fact the debtors mailed a check to try to cure default before the repossession took place, which was not received until after the repossession, did not render the repossession invalid. The statute allowing the creditor's self-help repossession, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 25-9-503, did not involve state action, so the protections of U.S. Const. amend. XIV were not triggered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for purchasing counterfeit crack cocaine from an undercover officer. Defendant, in a plea agreement, entered a guilty plea to attempted possession of cocaine while having a status as a habitual felon, and received a mitigated sentence. A year later, he successfully alleged an error in his sentence calculation. The trial court vacated his guilty plea and set aside his sentence. A new prosecutor indicted defendant for attempted possession of cocaine, felonious possession of drug paraphernalia, and being a habitual felon. He offered a plea agreement with a sentence that would have been identical to the first sentence defendant received. Defendant rejected the agreement, and after his convictions was sentenced to a longer term than his original sentence. Defendant alleged he was punished for having successfully challenged his original sentence. On appeal, the court found that defendant's being indicted for felonious possession of drug paraphernalia was not the result of prosecutorial vindictiveness. Further, there was no error in defendant's receiving a longer sentence for the two convictions, as N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1335 (1999) was not available to him.</SPAN></P>

The word &quot;now&quot; could only refer to the time prior to or before the questioning about the murder. There was nothing in the record to indicate that the Miranda warnings given to defendant, specifically his right to counsel, was conditioned on his willingness to undergo interrogation or &quot;linked with some future point in time.&quot; The detective took extra care to provide defendant his Miranda warnings both orally and in writing. Defendant failed to preserve the issue that his life in prison without parole sentence was unconstitutional because he failed to object to the sentence imposed at trial. Defendant failed to prove that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-7 and 7A-601 were unconstitutional as applied to him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer operated a business which, inter alia, charged admission for live entertainment. It paid sales tax on those receipts. The agency found it was also subject to a privilege tax under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-37.1(a). The taxpayer's payment of sales tax on these receipts did not exempt them from the privilege tax, because that exemption only applied if the receipts were otherwise taxed under N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 105, art. 2, and the sales tax was covered under N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 105, art. 5. Under N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2 (1999), the receipts could not be taxed except by uniform rule.  N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-37 (1943) previously taxed opera houses and movie theaters in the same manner, and the taxpayer's business was the modern equivalent of an opera house. By a subsequent amendment to this statute, movie theaters were exempted from its operation, without any rational explanation for the resulting differential treatment. While the legislature had broad authority to establish classifications for purposes of taxation, equality within the classification was required, so the tax could not validly be assessed against the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the attorney brought his motion before the judge who had been assigned to the county in the resident superior judge's absence. This judge granted the motion. When Rule 9(j) was declared unconstitutional, the hospital and doctor claimed the extension that was granted under that statute was void so that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations, and that the suit was void because the judge who granted the motion for the extension did not have the authority to grant the motion. On appeal, the court found that (1) the survivor had a reasonable time to file her complaint after the statute granting her an extension was declared unconstitutional, and (2) the presiding superior court judge acted with the power of the resident superior court judge.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found (1) there was adequate evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could conclude that defendant knowingly and intentionally gave an address he knew to be false when he registered his address; (2) defendant waived his right to appellate review of the jury instructions given by not properly objecting at trial or asserting plain error in his appellate brief; and (3) the trial court did not error in permitting a fingerprint expert to testify as to defendant's identity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant investor appealed from an order of the Forsyth County Superior Court, North Carolina, which granted plaintiff sisters' motion to compel production of client/investor documents as part of discovery in relation to losses they suffered as result of various investments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The investor argued that the trial court committed reversible error on the grounds that the order compelled him to produce potentially attorney- client privileged documents in violation of the attorney-client privilege. The sisters contended that the attorney-client relationship never existed between them and the investor. The investor had a license to practice law, but the appellate court held that simply having a license to practice law did not allow the attorney-client privilege to automatically attach. The investor did not establish the existence of the privilege where he had argued the opposite by denying that he had any fiduciary duties to the sisters. The investor also argued that his opportunity to be heard violated due process. The appellate court held that under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (1999), no notice was required for the type of discovery in question. The information only needed to be calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence. Because the investor was is unable to show that an attorney-client privilege existed and that the trial court abused its discretion, his claims of error were rejected.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court vacated all judgments and remanded for resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue raised by defendant was whether the trial court committed error when it enhanced his first-degree burglary sentence, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.16A, without the statutory enhancement factors having been charged in the indictment, without submitting those factors to a jury, and without requiring the State to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court found that error was committed. The first-degree burglary indictment did not allege that defendant used, displayed, or threatened to use or display a firearm at the time of the felony. Neither the indictment nor any other alleged these firearm enhancement factors. Therefore, enhancing defendant's sentence absent statutory factors being included in an indictment was erroneous under North Carolina case law. Defendant's plea of guilty had no bearing on the requirement that statutory factors supporting an enhancement must be included in the indictment. Even though the firearm enhancement statute was mentioned in the plea agreement, it was not included in an indictment. Thus, defendant was not bound by his plea allowing enhancement of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and remanded the burglary sentence to the trial court with instructions to resentence defendant without imposition of an enhanced sentence pursuant to the firearm enhancement statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to consecutive sentences for each of the convictions, and to enhanced sentences in the second degree kidnapping convictions for the use of the firearm.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man robbed a cab driver at gunpoint and locked her in the cab's trunk. They then drove to a grocery store where they locked two employees in the bathroom and robbed them at gunpoint. They also assaulted another employee and stole the store's cash and receipts at gunpoint. On appeal, the court found that (1) an amendment to the indictment which corrected the misspelling of a victim's name was permissible under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-923(e) (1999) because it did not substantially alter the charge in the original indictment; (2) it was not error for the prosecutor to comment on defendant's failure to produce witnesses or exculpatory evidence to contradict the evidence the State presented; and (3) while it was error not to submit to the jury the specific question of fact whether defendant possessed a firearm during the second degree kidnappings, it was not plain error, because there was no reasonable possibility that a different result would have been reached at the trial; however, the indictment was fatally defective because it failed to allege the required facts to support the firearm enhancement found in N.C.

Defendant appealed his sentence as an habitual felon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Habitual Felon Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-7.1 to -7.6 (1999), violated the separation of powers act, an argument that was previously rejected by the appellate court. Defendant further argued that the language of the statute indicates that a defendant is not an habitual felon until the jury finds him guilty of being an habitual felon. Thus, he did not become an habitual felon until the jury returned its verdict. The appellate court, however, found the statute to be clear. Defendant became an habitual felon when he was convicted of the third qualifying felony. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to sentence defendant in the mitigated range. The trial court here, after hearing defendant's evidence regarding mitigation, determined, in its discretion, not to depart from the presumptive range; hence, as the trial court explained, it did not make findings of mitigating factors.

It also argued that the fine imposed by the trial court was excessive because it was disproportionate to the crime committed. The appellate court held that the statute was not unconstitutional on its face since the legislature properly delineated the standards to be followed in setting a fine as punishment for a crime. Applying the grossly disproportionate test, the appellate court concluded that defendant's fine was not grossly disproportionate, and therefore did not violate the Excessive Fines Clause; disseminating obscenity was a felony and defendant obtained its money directly from the sale of obscene materials, a clear violation for which the fine was imposed. It also held that the fine was not excessive, since when considering defendant's financial resources a lesser fine may have been seen as an acceptable price of conducting business and therefore not a deterrent.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had not abused its discretion in not considering aggravating or mitigating factors and sentencing defendant within the presumptive range for each charge. As a trial judge traditionally had broad discretion in determining an appropriate sentence, the North Carolina sentencing scheme did not deprive defendant of either due process or equal protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Buncombe County, North Carolina, convicted defendant of driving while impaired and sentenced him to an imprisonment of 12 to 15 months. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-138.5 (1999), the habitual impaired driving statute, violated the principles of double jeopardy under the United States and North Carolina Constitutions, and that if the statute was constitutional, it was unconstitutionally applied. Status offenses, such as N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-7.1, the habitual felon statute, were not separate criminal offenses and did not run counter to double jeopardy concerns. Habitual impaired driving was a substantive offense. The habitual driving while impaired statute did not violate the prohibition on double jeopardy, because it enhanced punishment for present conduct rather than repunishing for past conduct. Whether a statute survived a double jeopardy constitutional analysis did not depend on whether the statute was called substantive or status, or whether the statute was comprised of elements or sentencing factors, but what the statute accomplished in reality. Rather than being punished three times for each of the two misdemeanor driving while impaired convictions, as defendant argued, defendant was punished only one time for his most recent offense, though more severely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient alleged malpractice based on failure to warn the patient of possible side effects of a prescription drug and to monitor the patient's use of the drug. The patient could not find an expert who would be willing to testify that the medical care did not comply with the applicable standard of care, as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, Rule 9(j) (1999). The patient filed the action under an alternate section of the statute which allowed filing of a malpractice claim without the required certification if the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor applied. The appellate court held that the trial court had properly determined that the res ipsa loquitor exception did not apply. The lack of medical certification could not however bar the patient's suit as the certification requirement unduly burdened the filing of a medical malpractice claim and therefore violated the due course of law clause of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 18. The statute also violated the equal protection clauses of both the federal and state constitutions as it did not represent the least restrictive method for addressing the asserted state interest of preventing frivolous lawsuits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the instant court found that defendant's resentencing hearing was not a critical stage of the criminal proceeding in which he was entitled to counsel; thus, none of his substantial rights were at stake. None of defendant's constitutional rights were violated during resentencing because defendant was not entitled to counsel under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-451. Because defendant could not waive a right to counsel he did not have in the first place, the trial court was not required to make the inquiry mandated by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1242. While the instant court agreed that the trial court erred by ordering a 36-month term of probation, it did not agree with defendant that his sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate to the crime of the unauthorized practice of law because his term of probation was within the discretion of the trial court. However, the appellate court found that the trial court failed to make the required findings of fact that a longer term of probation was necessary. It also erred by imposing conditions of probation by oral notice rather than by a written statement as required by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen held a semi-annual pigeon shoot where contestants shot pigeons released from boxes.

The citizen's declaratory judgment action sought to have &sect; 14-360 declared unconstitutional and to permanently enjoin its enforcement against him. The citizen's action should have been dismissed, because it necessarily involved questions of fact as well as questions of law, because any prosecution would be for future conduct, the nature of which was unknown. Even if the citizen's complaint only raised a pure question of law, while the record did establish the citizen had been threatened with prosecution under the challenged statute, he did not show that he stood to suffer the loss of either fundamental human rights or property interests. The statute did not authorize the state to confiscate the citizen's property, and the fact that he could have been prosecuted in the future for violating the statute did not amount to a denial of his fundamental human rights, even if he was ultimately acquitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's previous sign ordinance set forth certain requirements for outdoor advertising signs which &quot;grandfathered-in&quot; non-conforming signs. A subsequent ordinance, challenged by the advertisers, required the amortization of the grandfathered signs over seven years. While an appeal did not properly lie from the trial court's partial summary judgment, the appellate court exercised its discretionary authority under N.C. R. App. P. 21(a)(1) to allow each party's petition for writ of certiorari. The provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 160A-385 (1999), 160A-386 (1999), allowing the filing of protest petitions regarding zoning amendments, applied equally to amendments to the text of zoning ordinances as to amendments of zoning maps. The trial court erroneously found the only lots affected by the ordinance were the previously grandfathered lots subject to the seven-year amortization provision. The ordinance expressly referred to all off-premises signs made non-conforming by subsequent amendments. The city carried out its obligations under &sect; 160A-386 to determine the sufficiency and timeliness of protests filed and the percentage of land owned by the protestors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed insofar as it found the ordinance subject to the protest petition statutes and that the city performed its obligation under those statutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee suffered from bipolar mood disorder. As her illness worsened, she was allowed to change jobs and work part-time. While still working as a part-time employee, she applied for disability retirement. The appellate court held that the trial court, in overruling the board's denial of benefits, properly followed the statutory procedures of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 150B-5. The trial court's application of the de novo standard of review was proper, since the employee had challenged all of the board's conclusions of law. While the first trial court lacked jurisdiction to transfer the case to the second trial court, the board failed to alleged any prejudice occasioned by this transfer, so this error was harmless. However, the appellate court found that the trial court erred in reversing the board's denial of disability benefits. Since the employee did not &quot;retire&quot; when she changed jobs and lessened her hours, she was not eligible to receive disability retirement benefits under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 128-27(e). The trial court also erred in ruling that the board, a government agency, was estopped from denying the employee benefits.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the commission's conclusions in support of its denial were not based on substantial evidence. The commission improperly considered the fact that the landowner had other parcels he could develop in determining whether denial of a variance would impose an &quot;unnecessary hardship&quot;; this factor related to the unique nature of the property; not of the landowner. There was not substantial evidence that any conditions peculiar to the land had dissipated due to the long absences of residences on the property, or that the general assembly or the commission anticipated the reemergence of wetlands when the Coastal Area Management Act was passed.

He argued that his state and federal constitutional rights were violated. The totality of circumstances surrounding the stop of defendant's vehicle was a lawful Terry stop. Defendant's illegal parking in known drug activity area along with the inoperable taillight on his vehicle afforded officers reasonable grounds to believe that criminal activity could be afoot, justifying a brief detention. The officers determined that it was necessary to ask defendant to step outside his vehicle so they could frisk him. The defendant voluntarily consented to the vehicle search and no evidence to the contrary was presented. Prosecution for possession with intent to sell or deliver cocaine and requiring the defendant to pay taxes on the drugs seized pursuant to the North Carolina Unauthorized Substances Taxes in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105-113.105 through 105.113.113 (1997) was not double jeopardy.

The store was in a zoning district in which adult establishments were forbidden. The store appealed to the board, which, after a quasi-judicial hearing, ruled that the store was illegally operating an adult bookstore and adult mini theatre. The store sought judicial review; the intermediate appellate court affirmed. The store appealed again; the instant court affirmed. The search of the store, including videotaping its interior, taking pictures, and playing its videos, was supported by a valid administrative warrant. The store's late receipt of the board's staff report, which contained nothing not already a matter of public record, did not prejudice it. The evidence supported the finding that the store was an adult bookstore and mini theatre as defined by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-202.10(1), (6). It was proper for officers to conclude that videos and publications had adult content based only on viewing their covers. The amendment to &sect; 14-202.10 was not a substantive change and did not effect the validity of the city's ordinance, which was enacted before the amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the appellate court found that juvenile abandoned seven of her assignments of error by failing to argue them in her brief, and that the rest were not properly preserved, it considered errors that concerned the alleged illegality of her sentence. It held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7B-2513(a) was not unconstitutionally applied to juvenile in derogation of her equal protection rights since there existed a rational basis for the legislature's disparate treatment of adults and children; the state's desire to provide for the care and protection of its children was a compellingly rational justification. The appellate court also found that commitment of a juvenile to training school under the old juvenile code was equivalent to a Level 3 disposition under the new code; therefore, the trial court did not err in using juvenile's previous commitment to training school as a basis for imposing a Level 3 disposition. Finally, the appellate court held that juvenile was credited for time served in conjunction with the violation of her conditional released and that she was not also entitled to receive similar credit toward her new commitment term under the new disposition order.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had included as a prior conviction defendant's 1994 adjudication for criminal contempt. Defendant maintained criminal contempt did not constitute a prior conviction under the Act and his prior record level therefore should have been computed as Level II. Defendant's argument had merit. Because the appellate court could not determine the basis for defendant's 1994 criminal contempt adjudication, it had to resolve that issue in favor of defendant. Therefore, defendant's 1994 criminal contempt adjudication did not constitute a prior conviction for purposes of the Act, and the trial court erred by including such adjudication within its computation of defendant's sentencing level.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant on the breach of contract claim but denied summary judgment with respect to plaintiffs' quantum meruit claim. Defendant petitioned for certiorari. The appellate court found that plaintiffs could not enforce the contract or the quantum meruit claim which arose from it, because it was entered into and performed when their certificate of authority was suspended.

The trial court held that defendant was not brought to court at the first available opportunity, as the law required, but it denied defendant's motion to dismiss, as his original domestic violence charge was dismissed and the State had a compelling interest prosecuting him for the superceding felony. Defendant was convicted of felony assault, and appealed; the appellate court affirmed. Defendant showed no prejudice from his excessive pre-hearing detention, or any misconduct by the State. The trial court did not err in answering a jury question, as its answer was correct, and beneficial to defendant.

A jury found defendant guilty of all charges. The victim's statements to a psychologist identifying her father as her assailant was admissible on grounds that the information was pertinent to the victim's diagnosis and treatment. Defendant's assignment of error relating to the admission of the psychologist's testimony was overruled. Defendant objected that the indictments in the case were impermissibly vague. All discoverable information was made available to defendant; while some specificity as to the details of the offenses was unavailable because of the age of the victim at the time of the offenses. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for a bill of particulars. There was no requirement that the State prove that a touching occurred. Rather, the State needed only to prove the taking of any of the described liberties for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire. Moreover, statute, under which defendant was convicted, was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree kidnapping and possession of a firearm by a felon. The trial court enhanced defendant's sentence for the kidnapping conviction under the firearm enhancement statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.16A (Supp. 1996). On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, the trial court erred in: (1) denying his motion to dismiss the charge of second-degree kidnapping; (2) allowing into evidence alleged hearsay statements of the victim; and (3) enhancing his sentence for second-degree kidnapping under the firearm enhancement statute. The court found not error in the trial, concluding the State presented substantial evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted with the purpose of terrorizing the victim. Additionally, based on the circumstances surrounding the statement, the court found no error in the trial court's determination the oral statement was an excited utterance, and its admission was not improper. However, the court remanded the case for resentencing because the court agreed the firearm enhancement statute was facially unconstitutional as violative of due process under Apprendi.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits after he was diagnosed with a probable asbestos-related lung condition. The North Carolina Industrial Commission (Commission) found plaintiff had been employed by defendant employer for more than 31 years as a pipe fitter, maintenance mechanic, and millwright. The parties stipulated that plaintiff was exposed to asbestos fibers during his employment with defendant. Defendant transferred plaintiff to a separate department where he would not be exposed to asbestosis after he was diagnosed with that condition. The Commission concluded that plaintiff had developed asbestosis and modified a deputy's award. The Commission's award was pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-61.5(b) (1999) and it denied defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. The statute, which treated employers who exposed their employees to asbestos and silica differently than those who did not, was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of protecting workers from diseases known to be incurable and which usually resulted in total permanent disability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Commission's opinion and award affirmed as defendant was not denied equal protection merely because statute under which plaintiff recovered benefits allowed for recovery for workers who were exposed to asbestosis and silicosis as opposed to other occupational diseases, as statute was rationally related to legitimate government interest of protecting workers from those diseases contracted after a prolonged exposure to certain dust.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 97-62 because three medical experts testified that plaintiff's x-rays indicated evidence of pleural plaques and thickening consistent with asbestos exposure. Nor did the commission err in concluding that plaintiff was injuriously exposed to asbestos while employed with defendant employer because plaintiff testified that he wore asbestos gloves and that he laid asbestos wrap over pipes. The court held that it was not necessary that plaintiff be removed from employment to be entitled to 104 weeks compensation under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-61.5. However, because the commission found, without explanation, that plaintiff's average weekly wage should be calculated by looking to his last full year of employment with defendant employer, the court held that the commission's findings were insufficient to support its award of $ 319.38 per week to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for first-degree murder from the Robeson County Superior Court (North Carolina), claiming that he was denied his right to a speedy trial, that the incomplete transcript of his trial violated his constitutional and statutory rights, that his wife should not have been allowed to testify on cross-examination to confidential marital communications, and that the short-form indictment was insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant unjustifiably shot and killed a man on his property, and was arrested and subsequently indicted for first-degree murder. Three and a half years after his indictment, defendant filed a motion for a speedy trial. The trial commenced a few months later, and the jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder. Defendant's appeal was not heard for almost three years due to delays in obtaining the transcript. The court held that defendant did not suffer unconstitutional delay of a speedy trial because time alone was not a sufficient factor, the court docket was very crowded and defendant's counsel was occupied with some of those cases, defendant's actions were not consistent with a desire for a speedy trial, and the death of the principal investigator did not prejudice the defendant. The delay in the appeal was not attributable to the prosecution. The incomplete transcript was adequate to allow defendant to raise the appellate issues. The wife's testimony was admissible because the statement at issue was not induced by the confidence of the relationship and defendant's actions were not intended to be communication. The short-form indictment met statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from Durham County Superior Court (North Carolina) order granting defendants, police officer and city, summary judgment in her suit against them under 42 U.S.C.S &sect; 1983 (1994) and the state constitution, and for assault, battery, and false imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant police officer was working a second job as a truck driver and was making a delivery to the school where plaintiff, a school bus driver, was sitting in her parked school bus, hemmed in by other traffic. According to plaintiff, defendant, dressed in street clothes, yelled at her, ordered her to move her bus, then boarded the bus, told her she was under arrest, grabbed her arm, and unbuckled her seatbelt. Plaintiff sued defendant officer for violating her U.S. Const. amend. IV rights, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 (1994), and sued defendant city for deliberate indifference to such violations, alleging a pattern or custom of indifference. She also cited the N.C.

The appellate court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part. Taking the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, there remained disputed issues of material fact, precluding summary judgment, as to the incident between the officer and plaintiff, and qualified immunity did not shield the officer. Defendant city, however, was entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of second degree murder for the murder of his close friend. Defendant was sentenced to a term of 157 to 198 months in prison. Defendant appealed. The court held, first, that because defendant exercised his right to counsel before being informed of his Miranda rights (and before the warnings were even required), plaintiff was not constitutionally prohibited from introducing at trial the police officer's testimony concerning the manner in which defendant invoked his right to counsel. Second, the victim never assaulted or threatened to assault defendant prior to the homicide. The victim's inflammatory statement to defendant and his shoving of defendant were not sufficient legal provocation as to negate malice as a matter of law. Rather, the issue of provocation was properly submitted to the jury. Third, the trial court erred in imposing a civil judgment against defendant in the amount of $ 11,000 for the victim's funeral expenses, because N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1340.34, which authorized restitution, became effective after defendant committed the crime. Therefore, the order of restitution was vacated. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of restitution was vacated, because the statute which authorized the trial judge to order the payment of restitution became effective after the date on which the crime was committed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 17 year-old, was hired by a couple to kill the brother of one of them. The couple acquired life insurance on the brother and his 8 year-old son, changed their plan, and defendant and the female of the couple broke into the house of the 8 year-old's 82 year-old grandmother. Defendant poured gasoline in the room of the grandmother and boy, stabbed the grandmother, and left her after his female accomplice ignited a fire. The male of the couple confessed to police and implicated defendant and the female. Defendant confessed, was tried jointly with the female, and was convicted of murder, arson, burglary, and two counts of conspiracy to commit murder. The court affirmed except to remand for a new trial as to burglary and to arrest one conspiracy judgment. The fact that the juvenile statute did not require defendant's indigency for a court-appointed lawyer did not invalidate his Miranda warning to that effect. As the evidence was overwhelming, defendant's joinder arguments had no merit. Prosecutor comments as to defense counsel's mention of the Constitution were not unfair given that defendant first raised unconstitutional police conduct, or were the comments degrading.</SPAN></P>

In 1998, defendant pled guilty to the indecent liberties charge and received an eight-year sentence. Having already served most of his time, he was released on parole to a family care home. A few months later, defendant was released into his mother's care.

The trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a mistrial after discovering that the jury had returned a verdict on a verdict sheet that was captioned in the name of a different defendant because the rest of the sheet contained the correct information and when the jury was polled, each juror affirmed his or her vote that defendant was guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions of habitual misdemeanor assault and being an habitual felon were affirmed because habitual offender statutes were not ex post facto laws, counsel's assistance was effective, and lack of a jury instruction regarding defendant's removal from the courtroom was harmless. Defendant, who had previous assault convictions, was arrested for beating a woman and her daughter. The trial court did not permit defense counsel to argue the constitutionality of the habitual offender statutes,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-33.2 and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-7.1, to the jury. A requested instruction on disorderly conduct as a lesser included offense was denied. Defendant was removed from the courtroom for unruly behavior when the jury returned the verdicts. The appellate court affirmed the convictions because habitual offender laws did not violate the ex post facto prohibition. Disorderly conduct was not a lesser included offense. Although the trial court should have instructed the jury not to consider defendant's removal in determining guilt, the error was harmless because removal occurred after the jury had already returned verdicts on all issues but defendant's status as a habitual felon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This matter arose out of plaintiff's alleged violations of defendant county's ordinance to regulate adult and sexually oriented business. Plaintiff challenged an order of abatement and judgment of civil contempt entered by the trial court finding her in contempt of the permanent injunction issued and ordering her to immediately comply with the order and allowing her to purge herself of contempt. The court affirmed. Plaintiff admitted that she chose to invoke her U.S. Const. amend. V right so as to not incriminate herself by testifying at trial. The court held that plaintiff must choose between her right not to incriminate herself in a pending criminal trial and her claim that she could not be held in civil contempt. The record was replete with evidence that plaintiff willfully and with stubborn disobedience failed to comply with and knowingly violated the injunction against her. Thus, the court's review of the record revealed that there was competent evidence to support the trial court's holding plaintiff in contempt, and the court held that plaintiff, by her refusal to present testimony, chose to abandon her claim that she was not in contempt of the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered appellant to return to involuntary confinement. Appellant challenged the order, arguing that the statutory definition of mentally ill was unconstitutionally vague, that he could no longer have been classified as mentally ill, and that the trial court violated his due process rights. The court affirmed the order, because, first, appellant did not raise the vagueness question in the trial court, and therefore the court could not have considered it. Second, even if appellant were neither psychotic nor drug dependent, he could still have been found mentally ill by virtue of having been diagnosed with a personality disorder. Finally, as the trial court noted, evidence of appellant's extremely violent homicidal crimes, his past and present mental illness, his behavior, and his likelihood of post-release relapse into multi-substance abuse, which was a trigger for his psychosis, showed appellant's dangerousness to others. Thus, the trial court did not violate his due process rights as the probative value of the evidence outweighed any prejudice due to the crimes' age.</SPAN></P>

Marlene Hyatt on 17 June 1997 in Superior Court, Catawba County and orders entered by Judge James L. Baker, Jr., on 8 May 1997 and 16 May 1997 in Superior Court, Catawba County.  On 20 October 1998, the Court of Appeals issued a unanimous decision, 131 N.C. App. 206, 505 S.E.2d 911 (1998), holding in pertinent part that defendants Rowe and Pruitt did not file a timely appeal of preliminary orders entered by Judge Baker following a hearing under N.C. Gen. Stat.  &sect; 136-108, but finding error in the admission of evidence which required a new trial in the case. Under N.C. Gen. Stat.  &sect; 7A-31 (1999), the Supreme Court granted discretionary review of this Court's decision on the issue of timeliness of the appeal by defendants Rowe and Pruitt from the interlocutory orders entered on 8 May 1997 and 16 May 1997, and held that &quot;the interlocutory orders entered did not affect a substantial right of defendants and that defendants were not required to immediately appeal&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the trial court's orders.&quot; The case was remanded to this Court for a determination of the issues raised by the appeal from the interlocutory orders.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant condemnees appealed a judgment on remand from the North Carolina Supreme Court, contending that the trial court erred in treating all of defendants' property as a unified tract. Defendants also urged that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-112(1), which allowed a deduction from compensation for special or general benefits resulting from the taking, violated the Equal Protection Clause and deprived them of just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment and ordered a new trial in a condemnation action which awarded no compensation to defendants. Plaintiff government contended that the benefits of the taking to defendants' remaining acreage outweighed any loss. The court agreed with defendants that for two of four remaining tracts, no unity of use existed to justify considering them as affected land. Thus, any benefits accruing to those parcels were not attributable to benefits realized by defendants. The court also agreed that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-112(1), allowing general benefits, those accruing to the general public, to be used as a setoff was unconstitutional because it allowed unjust compensation to the condemnee while providing a windfall to the public. Accordingly, allowing special benefits, those accruing only to the remaining tracts, as a setoff was constitutional. The statute also violated the Equal Protection Clause because property owners, who had part of their properties condemned under a different statute, were not subject to general benefit setoffs. Under strict scrutiny review, there was no compelling interest supporting a classification based on who was condemning.</SPAN></P>

General benefit setoffs unconstitutionally deprived defendants of just compensation and violated their equal protection rights because other condemnees were not subject to such setoffs, and defendants unfairly bore the cost of public windfalls.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from the McDowell County Superior Court (North Carolina), which eliminated appellant's workmen's compensation subrogation lien against the proceeds of a settlement entered into between appellee and a third-party tort-feasor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was injured in an automobile collision with a negligent third party during the course of her employment with appellant. Appellant paid workmen's compensation benefits to appellee. Appellee sought a determination of the amount of appellant's subrogation lien on appellee's settlement with third party. The court affirmed. The fact that appellant was not negligent with respect to appellee's accident was irrelevant because the third party was not alleging that appellant was negligent and contributed to the accident. The trial court had authority pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 97-10.2(j) to reduce an employer's lien on the proceeds of an employee's settlement with a third party, and did not abuse its discretion in doing so in the present case. The trial court made findings concerning the extent of appellee's injuries, ongoing pain and suffering, and the fact that the third party had no additional assets from which appellee could recover. The trial court's conclusion that the settlement amount inadequately compensated appellee for her injuries and the reduction of the entire lien was reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decision, finding that reduction of appellant's entire subrogation lien on the settlement between appellee and a third party was reasonable because the trial court had the authority under the statute to reduce an employer's lien on an employee's settlement with a tort-feasor. The decision to reduce the entire lien on the basis that the settlement did not adequately compensate appellee was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, cited for not wearing safety helmets did not deny being aware of the requirement that motorcyclists wear safety helmets. A number of them possessed safety helmets when cited. Defendants challenged the statute as being vague. Even assuming that the statutory requirement that a safety helmet be of an approved type was vague, a person of reasonable intelligence would have understood that failure to wear some type of safety helmet would have been prohibited under North Carolina law. The trial court's ruling granting defendants' motion to dismiss was reversed. A litigant challenging a statute as unconstitutional had to have standing; to have standing, he had to be adversely affected by the statute. Because defendants were not wearing safety helmets of any kind when they were cited, they did not fall in the class of persons adversely affected by the statute and therefore lacked standing to challenge it on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In action for damages incurred by plaintiffs in automobile accident with defendant police officer, who was driving defendant city's van, plaintiffs appealed an order of the Guilford County Superior Court (North Carolina), which granted defendants summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Issues relevant to this appeal were whether defendants could assert governmental immunity for damages incurred by plaintiffs in an auto accident with defendant police officer while he was driving defendant city's van; whether defendant city participated in a local government risk pool; and whether defendant city violated plaintiffs' equal protection and substantive due process rights by its assertion of governmental immunity as to their claims while it admitted settling claims of similar tort claimants. The court held that summary judgment for both defendants was proper as to their lack of liability for damages stemming from the accident under the doctrine of governmental immunity, and failure to waive governmental immunity due to participation in local government risk pool. However, the court also held that plaintiffs could bring suit for monetary damages against defendant city under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983; there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether defendant city violated plaintiffs' due process and equal protection rights due to arbitrary and capricious behavior and whether such behavior was reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' judgment notwithstanding the verdict and in the alternative a new trial was denied. Defendants argued that the trial court erred in granting plaintiff's N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss their inverse condemnation claim. Defendants' answer failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted under inverse condemnation, because plaintiff had exercised its formal taking power and the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-112 would guide the determination of the proper amount of just compensation. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 136-112 did not violate the state constitution &quot;law of the land clause.&quot; The trial court did not err in refusing to allow a witness to testify concerning the sales price of different property, because it was too dissimilar.
