</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee hospital sued the agency for health care administration, contending that former &sect; 408.036(3)(l), Fla. Stat. (2004), concerning an exemption from a certificate of need (CON), was unconstitutional as a special law enacted in the guise of a general law. Appellant hospital intervened. The trial court ruled that former &sect; 408.036(3)(l) was unconstitutional, and the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) affirmed. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sought the agency's permission to establish a new hospital with an open-heart surgery program. State law required it to submit a CON as a condition for approval. Then, former &sect; 408.036(3)(l), which had a four-year sunset date, was enacted. It created an exemption from the CON requirement for hospitals seeking to establish an open-heart surgery program that met certain very narrowly defined criteria. Appellees argued that as appellant was the only Florida hospital that could qualify for this exemption, former &sect; 408.036(3)(l) was a special law that was invalid as it was not adopted pursuant to the notice requirements of art. III, &sect; 10, Fla. Const., and &sect; 11.02, Fla. Stat. (2004). The high court agreed. The evidence supported the trial court's finding that appellant was the only Florida hospital that could qualify for an exemption under former &sect; 408.036(3)(l), Fla. Stat., and that the process contemplated by the statute would take so long to accomplish that there was no reasonable possibility that any other Florida facilities could use the exemption before the sunset date. Hence, former &sect; 408.036(3)(l) was an unconstitutional special law enacted in the guise of a general law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of business and professional regulation filed an administrative complaint against appellee racetrack, alleging it violated &sect; 550.615(6), Fla. Stat. (1996). The racetrack filed suit, contending that &sect; 550.615(6) was unconstitutional as a special law enacted in the guise of a general law. The trial court agreed, as did the First District Court of Appeal (Florida). The department and appellant intervenors sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 550.615(6) prohibited thoroughbred permitholders from engaging in intertrack wagering in any area of Florida where there were three or more horserace permitholders within 25 miles of each other. The parties agreed that at the time &sect; 550.615(6) was amended in 1996, these conditions existed only in the area where appellee racetrack was located. The trial court found that there was no reasonable possibility that these conditions would ever exist in another part of Florida. As a result, because the legislature, when enacting &sect; 550.615(6), had not complied with the notice provisions mandated by art. III, &sect; 10, Fla. Const., the statute was an unconstitutional special law enacted in the guise of a general law. Appellants argued that the trial court erred in applying a &quot;reasonableness&quot; condition to the evaluation of the possibility that &sect; 550.615(6), Fla. Stat., might apply to others in the future. The high court disagreed. The proper standard to apply under art. III, &sect; 10, Fla. Const., was whether there was a reasonable possibility that the class subject to the statute would include others in the future. It approved the findings and conclusions of the lower courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Escambia County Circuit Court (Florida) entered a final judgment that validated tax-increment-financed bonds proposed for issuance by appellee county after concluding that the county had the authority to issue the subject bonds without first obtaining the approval by referendum mandated by Art. VII, &sect; 12, Fla. Const. Appellant citizen, an intervenor, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted an ordinance and a resolution establishing an improvement district and authorizing the issuance of bonds to fund it. The bonds were to be used to finance a four-lane road-widening project in the improvement district and would reach maturity no later than the 35th year after revenues were first deposited into a trust fund. The ordinance defined the tax-increment-financing scheme that would be used to repay the obligations created by the bonds. The county filed a complaint seeking validation of the bond issuance. The citizen intervened. The trial court entered a judgment validating the bond issuance. It concluded that the county had the authority to issue the subject bonds without first obtaining approval from the electorate by referendum as mandated by Art. VII, &sect; 12, Fla. Const. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the tax-increment-financing scheme to repay the bonds was an indirect attempt to pledge ad valorem taxes as a method of funding the project on a long-term basis and that the county could not do indirectly what it could not do directly, which meant obtaining approval from the electorate was required pursuant to Art. VII, &sect; 12, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, in and for St. Lucie County (Florida), denied defendant's motion to vacate his first-degree murder conviction and sentence of death, which he filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851, prompting his appeal and request for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a review of defendant's evidence, the court first found that his claim that counsel did not sufficiently advocate for him was based largely statements defendant took out of context, and he failed to show prejudice by counsel's other alleged shortcomings. Second, the alleged newly discovered evidence did not exist at the time of the resentencing, and thus, would not have helped defendant's cause. Third, the police did not possess a videotape defendant sought, and his request for the personnel files of a state investigator and two assistant state attorneys were irrelevant and were not reasonably calculated to lead to helpful evidence. Also, a letter which contained the mental impressions of an assistant state attorney about the case qualified as work product, and thus, was privileged. Finally, defendant was not entitled to habeas relief. Specifically, none of a challenged juror's vague memories about the crime, nor her attenuated relationship to a testifying detective, either separately or cumulatively, raises a reasonable doubt about her ability to be fair and impartial. Also, defendant failed to show that the motion for co-counsel would have been meritorious on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order denying defendant relief was upheld, and his request for a writ of habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first-degree murder and armed robbery. The trial court sentenced appellant to death. The convictions and sentence were upheld on direct appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with shooting an officer during a traffic stop, but claimed he did so in self-defense. At trial, evidence was introduced that a drug dog alerted to appellant's car, even though no drugs were found in the car. Appellant argued that his counsel were deficient for failing to properly challenge the canine-alert evidence. The trial court found, inter alia, that defense counsel believed any added attention would have placed emphasis where no emphasis was due. The appellate court found that the failure to properly challenge the canine-alert evidence did not represent a strategic choice. Neither of appellant's attorneys recalled any strategic reason for failing to challenge the canine-alert evidence. Indeed, one of the attorneys testified that he was surprised when he realized that there were no objections to this evidence in the record. Further, the defense was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance, because it was essential to the State's argument that appellant's motive for shooting the officer was to avoid being found in violation of his conditional release by possessing drugs and returned to prison. The State's case was based on this motive theory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court in and for Okeechobee County (Florida) convicted defendant of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised four issues on appeal: (1) the trial court erred in allowing hearsay testimony by defendant's girlfriend; (2) the trial court erred in finding the avoid arrest aggravator; (3) the death sentence was not proportional to other similar cases; and (4) Florida's death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed on issues 1 and 4. As to the first issue, it found that the witness's testimony constituted direct evidence of the group's activities and was properly admitted as relevant. Otherwise, testimony as to the statements of the others actually helped defendant, since it identified one of defendant's cohorts as the instigator of the plot. Further, defendant's statement that he hoped the victim had money, or else they would be &quot;going on a blank trip&quot; was admissible as an admission against interest. But, the court found that proof was lacking that the dominant or only motive for the killing was to avoid arrest in order to support the avoid arrest aggravator. Third, upon a proportionality review, the death sentence could not be upheld based on the single aggravator that remained. Thus, defendant's constitutionality argument was rendered moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was upheld, but the death sentence was vacated, and defendant was ordered to spend life in prison without the possibility of parole.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) reversed the trial court's judgment that terminated respondent father's parental rights. It then certified a question of great public importance to the state supreme court about whether in a proceeding on a petition for termination of parental rights pending adoption, the father's rights could be terminated for his failure to file a claim of paternity with the Florida Putative Father Registry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father, who was the alleged biological father of the baby at issue, became aware of the birth mother's pregnancy about three months before the baby's birth. About two weeks prior to the birth, petitioner adoption agency sent the father a certified letter, which he received, that requested that he contact the adoption agency. The letter did not inform the father that in order to preserve his rights regarding adoption, he had to timely file a claim of paternity with the Florida Putative Father Registry. The baby was then born. The same day as the child was born, the father filed a petition to determine paternity. The following day, the mother placed the baby with the adoption agency. The adoption agency then filed a petition to terminate the father's parental rights. The trial court ordered that his parental rights be terminated. On appeal, the appellate court reversed. On further review, the state supreme court found that his rights could only be terminated based on his failure to file a claim with the Florida Putative Father Registry if he was served with notice under &sect; 63.062(3)(a), Fla. Stat. (2005) and failed to comply with its requirements within the 30-day period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed racketeering, white collar crime, and all other charges against defendants, holding that &sect;&sect; 409.920(2)(a) and 817.505, Fla. Stat., were unconstitutional and that patient brokering charges against defendants were multiplicitous. The State appealed; the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) reversed the trial court's holding that &sect; 817.505 was unconstitutional, but otherwise affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants provided dental care to Medicaid-eligible children who were solicited by the other two defendants. Defendants split the fees paid by Medicaid. A dentist examined five of the children and found no evidence to support the claims submitted on their behalf. Defendants were charged with (1) racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering (&sect;&sect; 895.03(3), (4), Fla. Stat. (2002), respectively); (2) Medicaid provider fraud (&sect; 409.920(2)(a), Fla. Stat. (2002)); (3) split-fee patient brokering (&sect; 817.505(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (2002)); and (4) white collar crime (&sect; 775.0844, Fla. Stat. (2002)). The high court saved the constitutionality of the &quot;false statement&quot; prohibition of &sect; 409.920(2)(a) by severing the &quot;should be aware&quot; language from former &sect; 409.920(1)(d) as it pertained to &sect; 409.920(2)(a). The State had to prove defendants &quot;were aware&quot; of the nature of their conduct; State v. Wolland, 902 So. 2d 278 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005), was disapproved to the extent it held to the contrary. The fee-splitting charges were not multiplicitous. Fee-splitting was not a proper predicate for the racketeering or white collar crime charges, as fraud was not one of its elements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court reversed the intermediate appellate court's determinations that &sect; 409.920(2)(a), Fla. Stat., was unconstitutional and that the indictment was multiplicitous. It affirmed the remainder of that court's decision and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

He appealed and also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. The state supreme court found that he had not shown that he received ineffective assistance, especially in his primary claims regarding trial counsel's investigation and presentation of mitigation evidence, as well as trial counsel's decision not to challenge the DNA evidence since defendant had admitted being with the victim.

At trial, an accomplice testified that the woman had told defendant as she was being strangled that she wanted her children and that defendant had told him so. Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder and related offenses. He was sentenced to death. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the trial court did not err in excusing a juror for cause who voiced doubt about recommending a death sentence, that no error occurred in admitting the victim's statement about wanting her children since the statement was an excited utterance, that defendant was properly indicted, that alleged error regarding cross-examination of him was waived, that the evidence was sufficient to prove felony murder, that the evidence sufficiently proved a heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator, that the death penalty was not disproportionate, and that the death sentence was not unconstitutionally imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to killing a 75-year-old woman by beating her with a metal bar, slashing her throat, and repeatedly stabbing her. She had defensive wounds and was conscious at least until she was stabbed in the heart. The jury recommended execution; the trial court held a Spencer hearing (though defendant had waived one) and received additional mitigation evidence. Defendant did not seek to discharge counsel until completion of evidence at the penalty phase. The high court held his complaints amounted to dissatisfaction with counsel's trial strategies and a request for immediate sentencing--complaints that did not require a Nelson hearing. The brutal nature of the crime established the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator under &sect; 921.141(5)(h), Fla. Stat. (2004). That he planned to kill the victim to get money for drugs supported the cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator; there was no evidence his drug use robbed him of the ability to plan the murder. As he had a prior violent felony conviction, he could not challenge Florida's death penalty statute under Ring. The death sentence was proportional to other cases with similar aggravators and mitigators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Broward County (Florida), which convicted him of first-degree premeditated murder and felony murder and sentenced him to death. The trial court found the existence of four statutory aggravating factors, including the cold, calculated, and premeditated (CCP) aggravator under &sect; 921.141(5)(i), Fla. Stat.; two statutory mitigating factors; and five nonstatutory mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teenage victim died 19 days after being stabbed multiple times. She told a 911 dispatcher and paramedics that her roommate's boyfriend &quot;Rodney&quot; raped and stabbed her and gave them his phone number. After surgery, she picked defendant out of a photo lineup. On appeal, the court held that her identifications were admissible as excited utterances, &sect; 90.803(2), Fla. Stat., or dying declarations, &sect; 90.804(2)(b), Fla. Stat. The trial court properly allowed the jury access to the State's transcript of the 911 call with a proper limiting instruction. Evidence of the victim's pregnancy was relevant to the issue of consent, an element of aggravated battery, &sect; 784.045(1)(b), Fla. Stat., or attempted sexual battery, &sect; 794.011(3), Fla. Stat., offenses underlying the requested lesser included offense of third-degree felony murder. Although the victim did not die during the crime, the first-degree felony murder conviction, &sect; 782.04(1)(a), Fla. Stat., was proper because she died of medical complications caused by a felonious act. Although the CCP aggravator was error, it was harmless because the court stated that it had not considered that aggravator in deciding to impose the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court first reviewed the denial of defendant's postconviction relief claims, finding that trial counsel were not ineffective in: (1) failing to object to the alleged improper prosecutorial misconduct; (2) making opening statement comments regarding the sexual battery suffered by the victim; (3) failing to object to numerous statements made by the victim's brother, gruesome photographs admitted, and the prosecutor's appeals to the emotions of the jury; (4) failure to call a gynecologist to rebut the State's expert; (5) failing to object to the State's presentation of non-statutory aggravating circumstances; and (6) failing to call additional mitigation witnesses. Moreover, defendant failed to demonstrate any prejudice thereby. Second, defendant was not entitled to habeas relief. The court initially found that his Ring challenge was procedurally barred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to discover a tape which allegedly would have demonstrated that the testimony of a key State witness (appellant's girlfriend) was false and coerced. Appellant failed to show that the evidence ever existed, and the girlfriend maintained that she was not coerced. Trial counsel was also not ineffective for not cross-examining a witness to bring testimony before the jury that the witness touched the victim's body after the subject shooting. The witness testified at a hearing and at trial that he saw no other guns at the crime scene besides the masked shooter's gun; therefore, there was no support for appellant's claim that the witness's testimony that he touched the victim's body after the shooting somehow would indicate that the witness took a gun from the body. Appellate counsel did not render ineffective assistance in failing to raise on direct appeal the trial court's alleged error in excusing a prospective juror for cause. The juror seemed confused about several of the questions asked during voir dire, and also reported that he had trouble remembering his previous place of employment because of a stroke.</SPAN></P>

He sought postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and newly discovered evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three prisoners testified the inmate confessed to murdering a teenaged girl. The high court held that as the prosecutor merely stated her belief that the State satisfied its burden of proof, defense counsel's failure to object was not deficient. The prosecutor's alleged improper vouching for a witness was in fact a fair comment in response to defense counsel's attack on the witness's credibility. As documents signed by a witness did not prove he testified falsely at trial, the prosecutor testified that she believed the witness's testimony was truthful, and the documents contained unsubstantiated allegations written a year after the trial, the inmate's Giglio and newly discovered evidence claims were properly denied. A statement was properly excluded as uncorroborated hearsay which failed to qualify as a statement against interest under &sect; 90.804(2)(c), Fla. Stat. (1991), because the declarant never admitted to committing the murder or any other crimes. The trial court properly refused to credit a witness's recantation of his trial testimony. Regarding the habeas petition, as the inmate's conviction was final before Ring v. Arizona was decided, his claim based on Ring lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court found only three claims merited review: (1) involving newly-discovered evidence, (2) that resentencing counsel provided ineffective assistance, and (3) that the trial court erred in denying his cumulative error claim. The state supreme court rejected each of those claims. It found as to the newly-discovered evidence, DNA evidence showing that a pubic hair recovered from his belt buckle did not match the victim, that such evidence would not likely result in an acquittal at a retrial. It found as to ineffective assistance of counsel that he did not show he was prejudiced, and that as to cumulative error, he did not show error as to any individual claim at all and, thus, could not show cumulative error.</SPAN></P>

Defendant raised two claims on appeal: (1) that the court erred in concluding that the second prong of the definition of mental retardation requires a current assessment of adaptive functioning, and (2) that the trial court erred in concluding that he was not mentally retarded. The state supreme court found that the language of the relevant law, &sect; 921.137(1), Fla. Stat. (2005) and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.203(b), showed that a current assessment of adaptive functioning was required and substantial, competent evidence supported a finding that he was not mentally retarded.</SPAN></P>

His counsel was not ineffective for conceding the heinous, atrocious, or cruel (HAC) aggravating factor; referring to the murder as &quot;brutal&quot; and &quot;terrible&quot; was not a concession of the HAC aggravator, and counsel argued that the murder was not heinous, atrocious, or cruel. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge jurors for cause, as their exposure to pretrial publicity or their views on the death penalty were not sufficient grounds for such a challenge. Counsel made a reasonable tactical decision not to file a motion for change of venue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had for review a referee's report recommending that respondent attorney be found guilty of professional misconduct and that he receive a sixty day suspension and serve a three-year period of probation. The referee also recommended forfeiture of $ 2,277,663 to The Florida Bar's Clients' Security Fund. Complainant Florida Bar sought, inter alia, disbarment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was engaged in a secret &quot;engagement agreement&quot; with a corporation which he was suing on behalf of 20 clients. The corporation agreed to pay the attorney's law firm $ 6,445,000 in exchange for the firm's agreement not to pursue future claims against it and for the firm to possibly perform future work for the corporation on an hourly basis. Thus, the $ 59,000,000 offered to the law firm's clients and the $ 6,445,000 offered to the firm through the engagement agreement constituted separate funds. They created a conflict of interest when they executed the engagement agreement with DuPont, placing their financial interests above those of their Benlate clients. The attorney made false statements to a judge, made a false representation and committed an omission to two Florida Bar representatives, and deliberately did not tell his clients about the engagement agreement. The court held that it was clear that the attorney engaged in an extensive pattern of intentional deceit. Thus, disbarment was the appropriate sanction. Pursuant to R. Regulating Fla. Bar 3-5.1(h), the referee appropriately recommended forfeiture of the prohibited fees to the Florida Clients' Security Fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court imposed the sanction of disbarment. In addition to disgorgement of $ 2,277,663, the court ordered the attorney to pay interest on that amount.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his accomplices assaulted the victim, drove the bound victim in the trunk of a car to a remote location, and shot and killed the victim.

On appeal, the court found that (1) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress his statement because the statement was voluntary; (2) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to declare Florida's capital sentencing scheme, &sect; 921.141, Fla. Stat. (2004), unconstitutional because the course of a felony aggravator was based on the unanimous kidnapping conviction by the jury, and the jury found defendant guilty of murder solely on a premeditation theory, precluding any overlap between the elements of the murder conviction and the aggravator; (3) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal because the State of Florida's circumstantial evidence case was sufficient to rebut defendant's hypothesis of innocence as to the murder count; (4) the trial court did not err in weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors; and (5) the death sentence was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to litigate the motion to suppress his confession, failing to present mental health mitigation and evidence of coercion at resentencing, and for conduct during voir dire regarding two potential jurors. Upon review, no evidence supported his claims. Second, the trial court correctly held that the inmate's due process claim claiming that the same trial judge improperly presided over his two death cases was procedurally barred because it was not properly asserted before trial. Third, no harm resulted from the State's pretrial questioning of defense counsel or the failure of the State to notify postconviction counsel of this questioning. Fourth, the appeals court reviewed several improper comments made by the prosecutor on the direct appeal after resentencing and found no reversible error. Finally, as to the inmate's habeas corpus petition, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the denial of the motion to suppress. Moreover, the inmate failed to show that, in all probability, appellate counsel would have been successful in overturning the trial court's findings and rulings on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Brevard County (Florida), which imposed a sentence of death on him upon resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from his rape, beating, and fatal strangulation of his elderly neighbor, as well his theft of her car. Defendant was sentenced to death for the first-degree murder. Thereafter, the trial court set aside the original penalty phase proceeding (PPP) and a second PPP again resulted in a death sentence. On appeal, the convictions and sentences were all affirmed except as to the death sentence. A remand for a PET scan was ordered, which showed an abnormality. Accordingly, the death sentence was vacated and the matter was remanded for a new PPP. After a Frye hearing, the trial court again imposed the death sentence. On appeal once more, the court found no basis to reverse the trial court's rulings. The State's use of a peremptory challenge for an African-American juror and a limitation as to voir dire examination regarding &quot;gory photographs&quot; were proper. There was no error in jury instructions on issues that were preserved for review, and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances under &sect;&nbsp;921.141, Fla. Stat. 2004), were properly considered and balanced by the trial court. The capital sentencing process was constitutional, and the sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner sought review of an order of the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County (Florida) which denied a motion to vacate a sentence of death under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The prisoner essentially argued that the trial court should have weighed his expert's testimony more heavily and discounted the testimony of appellee State's expert and the trial court's expert based on the testimony of the prisoner's expert.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After confessing to the police, the prisoner was convicted of first-degree murder, as well as other crimes. The trial court followed the jury's recommendation of death. The prisoner later asserted that he was mentally retarded based on &sect; 921.137, Fla. Stat. The State and the prisoner presented conflicting expert opinions. The trial court appointed its own expert. The trial court determined that based on the experts' evaluations, the prisoner was not mentally retarded. The prisoner had seen numerous mental health experts since he was 10. Several IQ tests placed him in the mildly mentally retarded range, and there were references as to some deficits in his adaptive functioning skills. On the other hand, some of his IQ scores were higher than what a mentally retarded person would have, particularly as to his performance IQ. The trial court clearly found that the prisoner's expert was not as credible as the other expert witnesses. The appellate court held that after all conflicts in the evidence and all reasonable inferences were resolved in favor of the trial court's decision, there was competent, substantial evidence to support the Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hillsborough County Circuit Court (Florida) entered a judgment that denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief requesting that defendant's conviction for first-degree murder and sentence of death be vacated. Defendant appealed and also petitioned the state supreme court for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim and defendant met at a bar. They then left when defendant asked for a ride. Defendant was later seen at a motel packing the victim's car. He then made an effort to keep anyone from going into the room he was staying in. He left the motel alone in the victim's auto. The next day, a cleaning person went into the room defendant had rented and found the victim dead from two stab wounds. The victim's wallet was found at a highway rest area with defendant's fingerprints on it. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and grand theft of a motor vehicle. The jury unanimously recommended the death penalty and the trial court sentenced him to death. His convictions and death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. On his amended motion for postconviction relief, the trial court denied his request for relief. On review of that ruling, the state supreme court found that he had not shown that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, he had not shown that newly-discovered evidence would lead to his acquittal on retrial, he had not shown any other error, and the petition he filed for habeas corpus relief did not show any viable claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a decision of the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida), which declared invalid portions of &sect; 924.07(1), Fla. Stat. (2003), as applied to appeals to the district courts. The State had sought review in the district court of a county court's denial of a motion in limine based on a hearsay issue. The county court had certified that issue as a question of great public importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county court denied the State's motion to admit as an excited utterance a statement by a domestic battery victim. Its ruling was based on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Crawford. After briefing, the district court dismissed the appeal and transferred the case to a circuit court, holding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter under Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(c). In doing so, the district court declared unconstitutional the provisions of &sect; 924.07(1), Fla. Stat. (2003) that the State relied on for jurisdiction because they had not been adopted in the appellate rule. The supreme court reversed. Section 924.07 constituted the general law enacted by the state legislature that, pursuant to Art. V, &sect; 5(b), Fla. Const., governed appeals by the State to circuit courts. The State could appeal the county court's limine order to a circuit court under &sect;&nbsp;924.07(1)(h), (l), Fla. Stat. and Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(c)(2). Thus, because the order was &quot;otherwise appealable to the circuit court&quot; under Rule 9.140(c)(2), and because it had been certified as a question of great public importance, the district court had jurisdiction to consider the appeal under Fla. R. App. P. 9.030(b)(4)(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's decision regarding its jurisdiction was reversed and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the supreme court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Orange County (Florida), which denied defendant's postconviction motion to vacate his conviction of first-degree murder and sentence of death. Defendant also petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus. The court had upheld defendant's conviction and sentence on direct appeal, and the United States Supreme Court denied defendant's petition for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from the killing of his wife. Defendant asserted that he was not competent to stand trial, but the court determined that the trial court entertained multiple motions from the defense regarding defendant's competency, ordered defendant to a psychiatric facility to be observed even after finding him competent, held multiple hearings during which the issue was discussed, and considered various experts' testimony and written reports. Further, the court held that the record supported the trial court's ruling that defendant was competent to proceed in postconviction proceedings, and that any difficulties in communicating with counsel were of defendant's own choosing rather than due to any mental defects. Because defendant would not assist his counsel in providing any mitigating evidence or circumstances, defendant was precluded from complaining of the same. Ultimately, the trial court concluded that defendant counsel's performance, although not perfect, was adequate to meet the demands of Strickland. With regard to the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the court found no merit in any challenge raised by defendant as no prejudice was shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant class representatives filed a class action against appellees, major domestic cigarette companies and two industry organizations (tobacco), for compensatory and punitive damages for injuries allegedly caused by smoking. The trial court awarded compensatory damages and punitive damages. The Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) reversed the final judgment with instructions that the class be decertified. The representatives appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that (1) res judicata did not bar the class action punitive damages claim due to a Florida Settlement Agreement as the class relied on legal theories that were based on injuries personal to the class members to support the punitive damages claim; (2) due process was violated by the jury determining a lump sum punitive damages amount before the total compensatory damages amount for the class was determined; (3) the trial court erred by allowing the jury to consider entitlement to punitive damages before finding that the representatives had established causation and reliance; (4) the district court erred in nullifying its previous affirmance of the certification order as Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(d)(1) did not authorize the subsequent (and different) appellate panel to substitute its judgment for that of the prior panel and reverse the trial court's certification order after the trial court entered its final judgment after Phase II of the trial plan; and (5) continued class action treatment for Phase III of the trial plan was not feasible under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(b)(3) as individualized issues of legal causation, comparative fault, and damages predominated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's reversal of the class action punitive damages award was affirmed, but the remainder of the court's decision was quashed. The compensatory damages award for two of the representatives was reinstated, the compensatory damages award for the third representative was vacated, the compensatory damages award was reversed as two companies, findings were affirmed, and the case was remanded for decertification and further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to the insurer. On review, the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) invalidated an exclusion contained in the policy that, although permitted in the state where the policy was executed, was not permissible under Florida law. The court then certified a question of great public importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds lived in their homesteaded residence in another state, where they purchased from their local insurance agent an automobile policy covering their cars. The insureds purchased a second home in Florida, and began spending several months there each year. The accident victims, who were winter neighbors of the insureds in Florida, were passengers in the insureds' car when it crashed with another car. The accident victims then sought underinsured motorist benefits under the insureds' policy. The state supreme court found that the district court erroneously applied a significant connection test to determine whether Florida bore a significant connection to the insurance coverage. However, the supreme court, in applying the lex loci rule instead of the significant connection test, found that the public policy exception to the lex loci rule required both the involvement of a Florida citizen in need of protection and the existence of a paramount Florida public policy. Thus, because the insureds were not permanent residents of Florida, the public policy exception to the lex loci rule did not apply. Accordingly, the exclusion contained in the policy was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Up for review was a decision from the Fifth District Court of Appeal, which certified a direct conflict with a decision in the Fourth District, and affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress drug evidence discovered on his person, entered by the Circuit Court of Volusia County's (Florida), during the course of a search incident to his arrest on an outstanding warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legal question presented herein was whether defendant had been &quot;seized&quot; at any point, as that term was defined under the Fourth Amendment, considering the totality of circumstances surrounding his contact with law enforcement. The instant court held that, upon such consideration, defendant was not seized when a police officer held defendant's identification, which he consensually and voluntarily provided, and viewed the same, as she conducted a computerized check for warrants in his presence. Second, neither defendant nor the officer moved away from the location where defendant produced said identification. Further, even if a seizure had occurred, the evidence discovered during a subsequent search of defendant's person was not subject to suppression, as the existence of a valid arrest warrant removed any illegality, and, absent any evidence of bad faith on the part of the officers, the search was incident to defendant's lawful arrest. Finally, retention of defendant's identification would not have constrained his ability to either request the return of the identification or simply end the encounter by walking away.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the Fifth District below, which affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress, was approved.</SPAN></P>

He also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The prisoner made several claims asserting ineffective assistance of trial counsel and appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was abducted from a parking lot. Her body was found abandoned in a wooded area. Two days later, the prisoner stole $ 600 from the victim's ATM account. The prisoner, who had scratches on his face was apprehended driving the victim's car. He had bloody scratches on his face and was almost conclusively the victim's blood. The prisoner confessed to a detective that he committed the murder and took the police to her body. The appellate court held the prisoner failed to demonstrate that trial counsel was ineffective. Because the prosecutor's comments were not improper, the lack of an objection by trial counsel did not constitute ineffective assistance. Trial counsel was not deficient in failing to object to the State's opening statements and closing arguments because they were fair comments on the evidence. Because the trial court correctly denied the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, there was no cumulative error. As to appellate counsel, there was no failure to conduct any meaningful investigation into mitigation. Mental health mitigation was vigorously pursued, the jury was instructed on statutory mitigation, and the trial court found mitigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>

The trial court followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced petitioner to death. On direct appeal, the state supreme court affirmed the death sentence. In post-conviction proceedings, the trial court denied his postconviction relief request made pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 and his public records request made under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.852. Petitioner appealed those rulings and also petitioned the state supreme court for habeas corpus and all writs relief. The state supreme court found that petitioner had not established a ground under which post-conviction relief was warranted and none of the public records that he requested would help his case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Florida Judicial Qualifications Commission (JQC) filed formal charges against respondent judge, who had been accused of plagiarism. After a JQC hearing panel voted unanimously to dismiss the charges, it recommended that the present court award costs to the judge. The judge filed a motion for attorney's fees, which the JQC challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge argued that he was entitled to receive attorney's fees under the Thornber doctrine, which stated that for public officials to be entitled to representation at public expense, the litigation had to arise out of or in connection with the performance of their official duties and serve a public purpose. The court stated that the doctrine did not apply to JQC proceedings. Under Art. V, &sect; 12(c), Fla. Const., the court could award costs to a prevailing party in JQC proceedings, but the constitution was silent with regard to the court's authority to award attorney's fees in such proceedings. The express constitutional vesting of authority in the court to grant costs in JQC proceedings implied that the court was without similar authority to grant attorney's fees in JQC proceedings. This did not violate the principle that the court should avoid constitutional questions when possible; rather, it acknowledged that before the court could take action, the Florida Constitution had to give it the power to do so. This was consistent with the concept of judicial restraint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest in the trial court to luring or enticing a child by use of an online service in violation of &sect; 847.0135, Fla. Stat. (2002), and to transmission of material harmful to a minor in violation of &sect; 847.0138, Fla. Stat. (2002). The Florida First District Court of Appeal denied defendant's constitutional challenges to &sect;&sect; 847.0135 and 847.0138, Fla. Stat, and declared the statutes to be valid. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the transmission statute,&nbsp;&sect; 847.0138, Fla. Stat., violated free speech principles, was overbroad under U.S. Const. amend. I and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, and was vague under the Due Process Clause in U.S. Const. amend. V and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. He further contended that both the transmission statute and the luring statute,&nbsp;&sect; 847.0135, Fla. Stat., violated the Dormant Commerce Clause under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The state supreme court found that, because the transmission statute only applied to electronic mail sent to a specific individual that a defendant actually knew was a minor or believed was a minor, the transmission statute did not suppress adult-to-adult speech. Further, the scope of the statute was sufficiently limited by its terms, thereby negating defendant's vagueness and overbreadth challenges. Finally, neither statute violated the Dormant Commerce Clause because the Florida dissemination statute at issue here applied only to electronic mail which was harmful to minors that the sender knew or believed was a minor located in Florida, and any burden that the luring statute placed on interstate commerce was incidental.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner's claim of ineffective assistance in his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion based on counsel's previous representation of a State witness as constituting a conflict of interest was unavailing because the prisoner did not show how the prior representation adversely affected his own case. As for his claim that counsel was ineffective for not presenting expert testimony or evidence of the prisoner's substance abuse in mitigation during the penalty phase did not merit relief because both decisions were strategic. In support of his habeas petition, the prisoner alleged that appellate counsel was ineffective. But counsel was not ineffective by not raising on direct appeal the State's introduction of collateral crime evidence because the evidence was admissible under &sect; 90.404(2)(a), Fla. Stat. (1996), and provided no meritorious claim for appeal. Counsel was justified by not appealing the admission of alleged hearsay testimony because the challenged testimony was not hearsay, and the statements were not prejudicial to the prisoner's case. A mistake by the prosecutor in his closing argument was not intended to impugn defense counsel and provided no basis for habeas relief.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for the purchasers. The Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) reversed, finding that the notice of the tax sale sent to the owners pursuant to &sect; 197.522(1), Fla. Stat. (2000), did not satisfy due process because it was sent to their former address. The purchasers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the owners notified both the tax collector and the clerk of court of their change of address, their address was not updated in the tax assessment roll, and the clerk sent the notice required by &sect; 197.522(1) to their old address. The intermediate appellate court held that the notice was defective; it was not reasonably calculated to apprise the owners of the sale because the tax collector knew or should have known that the address listed on the tax assessment roll was incorrect. The high court agreed. As the owners sent change of address notices, the return receipt for the statutory notice the clerk mailed was signed by someone other than the owners, and the sheriff provided written notice to the clerk that the owners no longer resided at the old address, the clerk received unique information about the intended recipients that warranted some additional action. Therefore, due process under the Fourteenth Amendment required the clerk to take additional reasonable steps to notify the owners of the tax deed sale. The high court rejected the contrary reasoning of Alwani v. Slocum, 540 So. 2d 908 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Those statements were admissible provided that in accordance with the statute. But, as to the testimonial statements made to law enforcement officers, the statute did violate the Confrontation Clause, and therefore the statute was unconstitutional as applied to those statements. Thus, the matter was remanded for the trial court to place on the record specific findings indicating the basis for determining the reliability of the declarant's statements introduced as hearsay under &sect; 90.803(24). Further, the court did not reach the issue of whether the statute was constitutional as applied to physically disabled adults who have no mental impairment.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed, noting that there was competent, substantial evidence to support the postconviction court's finding that resentencing counsel made a strategic decision not to present mental mitigation evidence. The transcript of the postconviction proceeding indicated that counsel considered but eventually rejected the idea of calling the forensic psychologist. The record demonstrated that the defense strategy was to show that the inmate had been a productive member of society who supported and led his family. The inmate also challenged the circuit court's determination that he was not mentally retarded in accordance with Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.203(b). The supreme court agreed with the circuit court, noting that although the inmate's IQ scores indicated mild mental retardation, the inmate communicated well, was able to work, and was able to care for himself. In addition, there was no evidence that the inmate met the statutory criteria of mental retardation before the age of 18.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from the brutal beating and stabbing death of his former girlfriend. Defendant asserted on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his proffered jury instruction on heat of passion. The court found no error, concluding that case law precedent had already established that the standard jury instruction on excusable homicide was sufficient to explain heat of passion in the context of premeditation. The court further found no error with regard to the denial of defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal/sufficiency of the evidence since there was an abundance of evidence establishing that the murder was premeditated by defendant in that he called the victim and planned a meeting under the ruse that he was dying of cancer. The 144 stab wounds and hammer blows inflicted by defendant also supported his conviction. The court did find error with the trial court finding that the mitigator of being unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law had not been established since six mental health experts testified that defendant was not able to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction but vacated the sentenced because the trial court erred in finding that the mitigating circumstance of being unable to conform one's conduct to the requirements of the law had not been established.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After discovering his wife's infidelity in the morning, defendant went to work, told a friend he was going to murder his wife, drove to the day care where she worked, confronted her, hit and kicked her, left the room and returned with a gun, and then shot at her several times while she tried to escape. He then drove to a pool hall and told two friends what he had done. Under these circumstances, sufficient evidence supported defendant's murder conviction. With respect to sentencing, while defendant was mildly retarded, three experts testified that he was not mentally retarded within the definition set forth in Fla. Stat. &sect; 921.137(1), and there was no evidence of onset before age 18. Therefore, he was eligible for the death penalty. The evidence did not support defendant's claim that he was suffering an extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the murder since he had time for reflection. He was able to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, and there was no link between his age and the crime, such as immaturity. Defendant did not show that the trial court abused its discretion in the weight it afforded to the mitigation found. His death sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Sarasota County (Florida) that convicted him upon a jury verdict of armed burglary, armed robbery, attempted sexual battery with a weapon, and first-degree murder, and sentenced him to death for the murder conviction under &sect; 921.141, Fla. Stat. (1983). He was also convicted of the related burglary, battery, kidnapping, and robbery of another victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and sentence were affirmed. Section 775.051, Fla. Stat. (2001), did not violate due process or equal protection because there was no fundamental right to use a voluntary intoxication defense and a rational basis existed for permitting prescription drug users to assert it. Evidence sufficiently supported the sexual battery conviction. In sentencing, due process did not require giving defendant an opportunity to allocute before the jury because he was allowed to allocute before the trial judge. Warning him that the State could cross-examine him about his suppressed confession if he testified about it did not improperly limit his right to testify. A prison official's testimony was properly excluded. Refusal to apply an age mitigator did not prevent defendant from asserting his emotional immaturity in nonstatutory mitigation. The death sentence was properly based on the totality of the circumstances. Section 921.141, Fla. Stat. (1983) was not unconstitutional because the aggravator for murders committed during felonies depended on facts found by juries. The murder conviction was sustained by sufficient evidence, and the death sentence was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

Second, because the inmate could not show that the chemicals involved in lethal injection would be administered improperly in his case, he was not entitled to relief on his First Amendment claim. Third, as the inmate never requested records from the Medical Examiner's Office or the Department of Corrections before his September 28, 2006 request, this claim was properly denied. Finally, the ABA Report cited was not newly discovered evidence. Further, nothing in the report would cause the instant court to recede from its past decisions upholding the facial constitutionality of the death penalty, and the inmate did not allege how any of the conclusions in the report rendered his death sentence unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The instant court first agreed with the circuit court's conclusion that a report published by the American Bar Association (ABA) was not newly discovered evidence, but was a previously available legal analysis and recommendation for reform directed to the executive and legislative branches. Second, even if the report were considered, it did not require finding the death penalty in Florida unconstitutional. Further, the inmate failed to allege how any of the conclusions reached in the ABA Report would render his individual death sentence unconstitutional. Third, newly discovered evidence which the inmate alleged showed a female friend's involvement in the victim's murder did not entitle him to a new trial. Moreover, even considering this evidence, nothing was presented which reduced his culpability. Hence, his actual innocence claim failed. Finally, there was no dispute that the inmate was given the opportunity to be heard and was represented by counsel during his first clemency proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner shot and killed his brother's 17-year-old girlfriend during an argument over her alleged unfaithfulness to his brother. During the guilt phase, the defense's theory was that he accidentally shot her while trying to hand a gun to her. The prisoner claimed his defense counsel was ineffective for, among other things, failing to discover that the prisoner suffered a closed head injury at age three. Defense counsel testified that he was not aware of the head injury and did not explore the prisoner's mental health because there was no reason to believe that the prisoner was insane or incompetent. The appellate court held the trial court correctly held that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to present the defense of diminished capacity because diminished capacity was not a viable defense in Florida. Moreover, it would have been inconsistent with the prisoner's theory that the shooting was an accident. The mere fact that the prisoner was represented by one attorney alone was insufficient to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to request a second attorney. &sect; 921.141, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that given the significant amount of evidence impeaching a cellmate's credibility, as well as the State's credibility in calling him to testify, the inmate had not established that the State's failure to disclose before trial a prosecutor's note following a telephone conversation with the cellmate's defense counsel constituted prejudice under Brady. Under Giglio, informing the jury that the cellmate might be testifying falsely because of his hope for an unguaranteed, unspecified award would not have rendered him sufficiently less credible in the jury's eyes to establish a reasonable possibility that this contributed to the verdict. Counsel was not ineffective for allowing a state investigator to be excluded from the rule of witness sequestration, as even if counsel should have objected, the inmate had not established that the state investigator's presence prejudiced him. The inmate's claim in his habeas petition that Florida's capital sentencing procedure was unconstitutional in light of Ring was without merit, as his convictions and sentences became final in 1993, nearly nine years before Ring was decided, and the decision did not apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner, who was convicted by a jury of first-degree murder, sexual battery, and grand theft, appealed the denial of his motion for postconviction relief by the Circuit Court in and for Escambia County (Florida) and filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of accosting the victim, stealing her car, sexually assaulting her, and killing her. The appellate court concluded that the prisoner had not demonstrated that the trial court erred in concluding that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress. It also found no error in the trial court's analysis regarding sentencing, which relied in large part on the failure of the prisoner to demonstrate that substantial mitigation evidence existed that counsel failed to discover. Most of the evidence put forth at the postconviction hearing was cumulative to evidence that was presented earlier and considered as mitigation, was not credible, or would actually have been harmful to the prisoner's case. Appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise a claim on direct appeal as it was not preserved for appellate review. An expert had an adequate basis on which to render an opinion on the DNA statistics evidence. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the prisoner's attempt to confer with counsel in the middle of his testimony. Appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise an issue that was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County (Florida), which denied his motion for postconviction relief under Fla.

Appellant was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, with the jury unanimously recommending the death penalty. The trial imposed separate death sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's convictions and sentences were upheld on direct appeal. On appeal, defendant contended that his trial counsel was ineffective for numerous reasons, including for failing to depose a witness or to challenge the credentials and testimony of the State's blood spatter expert. As to the failure to depose the witness, the court found that the record supported a carefully considered and planned defense strategy on behalf of appellant to continue to rely on an alibi defense of which the witness was not a part of. Trial counsel's decision not to request a continuance to depose the witness was also strategic in that defense counsel did not want to give the State any additional time to prepare the witness for trial. The failure to challenge the testimony or credentials of the blood spatter expert was also strategic in that the credentials of the expert were not relevant and the expert's testimony did not implicate appellant in the murders, nor was it even an element in the State's case against appellant. The court found no merit to any of appellant's ineffective assistance claims and that appellant's other claims were procedurally barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant's post-conviction motion and denied appellant's petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action that plaintiff smokers brought against defendant tobacco companies (Tobacco), the District Court of Appeal, Direct Conflict of Decisions, Third District, Florida (Third District), reversed a judgment for the smokers after a trial court had awarded $12.7 million to the three named class members and $145 billion in punitive damages. The smokers appealed, in part challenging the decertification of the class and other rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District ruled that a settlement in the State's prior case against Tobacco was res judicata, barring the punitive damages. The supreme court ruled that res judicata did not bar the punitive damages as the State sued on behalf of public issues of common concern, but the smokers claimed personal injuries from their smoking. The punitive damages, however, were excessive; they were set before any compensatory damages were decided on, which was a due process violation. The amount also would have bankrupted some defendants. The court held that there had to be a reasonable relationship between any punitive and compensatory damages. The Third District erred under the law of the case doctrine by decertifying the class; Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(d)(1) did not allow decertification after notice to thousands of citizens, a long trial, and entry of final judgment. Under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 22, the date of class certification closed the class, so as not to affect the right to opt out under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.220(d)(2) or affect the right of access to the courts under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. Defense counsel's racial pandering did not require reversal as the remarks were spread out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from the robbery of a fast food restaurant. Defendant and co-defendant shot or stabbed four people, with one victim dying. Of defendant's various claims, the court only addressed a few because many of the claims were procedurally barred or legally insufficient. Defendant asserted that co-defendant's receipt of a reduction in sentence to a life sentence was newly discovered evidence that warranted granting defendant a new sentencing phase. The court agreed that the reduced sentence was newly discovered evidence but that co-defendant was not legally eligible for the death sentence. Although co-defendant was the triggerman, the basis for co-defendant's reduction in sentence hindered defendant's ability to satisfy the second prong of the newly discovered evidence test since the evidence of the murder was not so strong that it would probably result in a life sentence for defendant. The court further found no ineffective assistance of counsel since the errors raised by defendant were not preserved for appeal and did not qualify for the fundamental error exception. The prosecutor's questions regarding the Bible were not objected to at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion for postconviction relief. The court denied defendant's petition for habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 3.850. Additionally, the inmate petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus. The inmate had been convicted of armed robbery, grand theft, and first-degree murder and had received a death sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of first-degree murder, based in part on testimony from the inmate's cousin. The cousin testified that the inmate recruited the cousin to rob the store where the inmate used to work and to kill a clerk. The cousin and a friend went to the store, got the cash boxes, and killed the clerk on duty. The inmate claimed that the cousin's subsequent recantation established the inmate's innocence. The court held that it was error for the postconviction court not to characterize the recantation testimony as newly discovered evidence. However, the recantation testimony was not credible, and there was competent, substantial evidence to support rejection of the recanted testimony. The skepticism expressed by a prosecutor concerning certain aspects of the cousin's testimony did not provide sufficient grounds for a Giglio violation. The inmate had not established a Brady claim because there was no evidence that the State had more information about the cousin's prior crimes than the inmate had. The inmate's habeas corpus claims for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel were without merit because the arguments did not impact the verdict reached.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate and two accomplices robbed two persons, killed them, and set their house on fire. At the Huff hearing, a forensic psychologist testified that defense counsel, who did not use a mental health expert during the penalty phase, failed to present statutory and nonstatutory mental health mitigation evidence or presented it in an ineffective manner. The high court held that counsel's decision not to call a mental health expert was valid strategy, since this could have opened the door to the admission of the opinion of a defense expert, who did not testify, that the inmate was a psychopath. The additional mitigators that the inmate asserted were not presented during the penalty phase were either presented or were not presented because defense counsel had no indication that they might apply. Additionally, even if the mitigation evidence had been presented in the manner proposed by the expert during his testimony at the evidentiary hearing, the trial court found him to be an unconvincing witness.

The inmate alleged his trial counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase for failing to present all available mental health mitigation. A neuropsychologist who testified for the defense at the competency hearing found no indication of retardation, borderline intellectual functioning, or major mental illness. The high court held that trial counsel's failure to call that expert at the penalty phase was valid strategy, as counsel found that his testimony during cross examination at the competency hearing was not helpful to the inmate. A forensic psychologist testified at the evidentiary hearing that the inmate had organic brain damage and functioned at the mental age of 14. However, counsel was unaware of any theory that the inmate's possible mental age was 14, and the trial court did not find the psychologist's testimony credible. All of the additional mitigators that the inmate asserted were not presented during the penalty phase were either presented or not supported by the record. Counsel's manner of presenting evidence that detailed the inmate's background was a reasonable trial strategy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought review of an order of the Circuit Court in and for Martin County (Florida), which denied the inmate's motion for postconviction relief under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, the inmate was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit robbery with a deadly weapon, carjacking with a deadly weapon, kidnapping, robbery with a deadly weapon, and third-degree grand theft, and the death sentence was imposed. The inmate sought postconviction relief, which was denied by the trial court. Affirming, the court held that the inmate had not shown ineffective assistance of pre-indictment counsel, as found by the trial court, because evidence showed that counsel's actions were informed, strategic choices that were supported by competent, substantial evidence. The inmate had not shown that he was prejudiced by trial counsel's conduct. Counsel's decision to concede the inmate's guilt did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel but was a reasonable trial tactic to which the inmate had consented. The inmate did not state a cognizable claim for habeas corpus relief. The inmate had procedurally defaulted the claim that the trial court should have considered other expert testimony in support of the mitigating factors, and the other claims were procedurally barred or without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed to address a certified question relating to the admission of a nontestimonial hearsay statements from a mentally disabled victim pursuant to Fla. Stat. &sect; 90.803(24)(2001). The issue arose after defendant was charged with a sexual battery on a mentally disabled victim. The State sought to introduce into evidence the victim's hearsay statements that were made to the victim's teacher and the statements that were later made to a law enforcement officer under the disabled adult hearsay exception set forth in Fla. Stat. &sect; 90.803(24)(2001). The trial court granted defendant's motion to strike. The intermediate appellate court agreed with the trial court that the statute was unconstitutional under the Confrontation Clauses in U.S. Const. amend. 6 and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court distinguished between the testimony given to the police officer and to the teacher, finding that the testimony to the officer was not admissible after Crawford unless defendant had been given an opportunity to cross examine. The court found that the statements to the teacher were admissible under Fla. Stat. &sect; 90.803(24), if there was a sufficient factual predicate established by the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner insured brought suit in a trial court against respondent insurer. A jury found for the insurer, which received attorney's fees under the offer of judgment statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. &sect; 768.79 (1999). A question was certified as to whether &sect; 768.79 applied to PIP suits. The Fifth District Court of Appeal, Florida, ruled yes but reversed, as the settlement offer was ambiguous and did not satisfy Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442. The parties sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer sought attorney's fees, as the insured rejected a PIP settlement offer. The release was general, and the insured, who also had a claim for uninsured motorist (UM) benefits, refused to sign the release for fear of also releasing her higher UM claim. On review, the court ruled that the offer of judgment statute applied to suits under the PIP statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. &sect; 627.736(7)(b) (1999), as they were suits for damages. Further, the attorney's fees provision in the PIP statute did not exclude other such provisions, including the one in the offer of judgment statute. Applying the offer of judgment statute to PIP suits also did not make the PIP system unconstitutional. Until an insurer offered to pay an insured's damages, attorney's fees, and related sums, the &quot;one-way street&quot; under Fla. Stat. &sect; 627.428 (1999) entitled an insured to attorney's fees. But once an offer was made and rejected, the insured who turned down the full sum owed had no right to protection under &sect; 627.428, and the insurer could then seek attorney's fees under the offer of judgment statute.&nbsp;Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442 precluded attorney's fees for the insurer as its release had not been limited to the PIP claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved in full the district court's decision reversing the award of attorney's fees to the insurer.</SPAN></P>

One expert did not miss signs of mental retardation or organic brain damage, and two experts concluded that there was no such damage. One doctor also helped establish nonstatutory mitigating sentencing factors. The court also saw no ineffectiveness of counsel, ruling that the inmate failed to prove prejudice, even if error occurred. He did not show that if his counsel had prepared one doctor better about the facts of the case that the outcome would have been different; there was no proof that the doctor's testimony would have been more favorable or materially more credible. Admitting part of fellow defendant's statement that was in the form of a recording was competent trial strategy even though the State was allowed to introduce the rest of his statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate challenged the orders entered against him, first arguing that (1) the circuit court erred in determining he was not mentally retarded and (2) his death sentence was not proportional. The appeals court disagreed, as he failed to meet any of the three prongs for determining mental retardation. No expert who tested the inmate as an adult, including those who also examined his adaptive skills, found that he met the definition for mental retardation. Further, the one doctor that tested the inmate when he was 15 concluded he was not mentally retarded. Second, the inmate's allegations that a 1993 resentencing order was deficient and that his death sentence was not proportional were not preserved and were procedurally barred, as they were considered on direct appeal from the inmate's resentencing. Third, the inmate failed to establish that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel to support his motion for post-conviction relief. Finally, with regards to his habeas petition, an Apprendi claim was not cognizable, and a claim that he might be incompetent at the time of execution was not ripe for review. Thus, the petition was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the inmate's postconviction motion and finding that he was not mentally retarded was affirmed, while his habeas petition was denied.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court found that (1) the trial court did not err in finding that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue and present evidence of defendant's drug addiction as defendant was adamant that trial counsel not rely on any evidence of intoxication or addiction in defendant's defense; (2) trial counsel was not ineffective in the manner and degree to which he investigated the mental health issues and counsel was not ineffective for not retaining additional mental health experts; and (3) given defendant's adamant, informed refusal to participate in the investigation and preparation of any type of mitigation, counsel's preparation and defendant's decision to waive his rights did not deny defendant of a reliable penalty phase proceeding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although appellant raised 14 issues on appeal, none had merit. For example, testimony by a witness linking appellant to a prior murder, which the trial judge had excluded, did not constitute fundamental error under Fla. Stat. &sect; 924.051, given appellant's admissions tying him to the commission of the murder in the instant case. Crime scene and autopsy photographs admitted into evidence were relevant to both the guilt and penalty phases of appellant's trial. The trial judge applied the correct rule of law, and substantial evidence supported the finding of the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator because the victim was conscious and aware of the beating, which was particularly brutal. He begged for his life but was told to shut up. He moved around the bedroom while fending off blows, experienced significant pain before losing consciousness, and eventually died by a blow to the head that was so severe that it fractured his spine. Finally, in conducting a proportionality review of defendant's sentence, the supreme court, after looking at the totality of the circumstances in comparison to other cases where the sentence of death had been upheld, found death a proportionate sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted for violating Fla. Stat. &sect; 409.920(2)(e) (2000), the &quot;anti-kickback&quot; provision of the Florida Medicaid fraud statute. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss on grounds that &sect; 409.920(2)(e) was unconstitutional. The Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) affirmed, finding that &sect; 409.920(2)(e) was preempted by federal legislation. The State sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that defendants engaged in a &quot;pay for patients&quot; scheme in which individuals received &quot;per head&quot; payments in exchange for soliciting and driving Medicaid-eligible children for dental treatment. The intermediate appellate court concluded that &sect; 409.920(2)(e) criminalized activity that was protected under the federal statute,&nbsp;42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1320a-7b, and stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress, thereby resulting in implied conflict preemption under the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. The high court agreed. The particular pay arrangement at issue involved protected employer-employee payments for the provision of covered items or services, which were protected from criminal prosecution under the federal statute.&nbsp;Fla. Stat. &sect; 409.920(2)(e) was preempted, and hence unconstitutional, because (1) it criminalized conduct that federal law specifically intended to be lawful and shielded from prosecution; and (2) unlike 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1320a-7b, it allowed prosecution of negligent or inadvertent behavior.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate, who was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death, filed a motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. After summarily rejecting most of the inmate's claims, and conducting a Huff hearing on the rest, the Broward County Circuit Court (Florida) denied the motion. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the Huff hearing, a former state witness testified he had lied to the grand jury about the inmate's confession; a second witness testified he gave similar false testimony to the trial jury. The inmate also alleged that the State failed to disclose exculpatory evidence that an assistant state attorney (ASA) had improperly briefed the first witness on the inmate's case, and that the first witness had passed this information on to the second. The trial court found that the recantations were not credible and denied those claims that were based on the truth of the recantations. The high court held that this credibility finding was supported by the witnesses' history of lying, their psychiatric deficiencies, their inconsistencies and lack of memory when testifying at the Huff hearing, and the contrary testimony of the ASA. Therefore, the second witness's recanted testimony was not newly discovered evidence with regards to the &quot;avoid arrest&quot; aggravator sufficient to merit a new penalty phase proceeding. As there was no exculpatory evidence to turn over, the inmate's Brady claim failed. Finally, since there was no misleading testimony, there was no Giglio violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Seminole County (Florida), which convicted him of two counts of first-degree murder and imposed corresponding sentences of death. He was also convicted of a lesser-included offense of second-degree murder and burglary of a dwelling during which a battery was committed while defendant was armed with a weapon, and he received varying sentences of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The three victims were found murdered in and near their trailer. Evidence that defendant was involved in a dispute with one victim, injuries that he sustained, and blood, fingerprint, and DNA evidence supported the jury's convictions. The sentences were imposed and on appeal, the court found that exclusion of certain statements by a witness whom defendant alleged had committed the crimes was proper as they were inadmissible hearsay under Fla. Stat. &sect; 90.801(1)(c) (2003) because they were to be offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Other statements by the witness were improperly excluded, but the error was harmless. The evidence was more than just circumstantial and supported the convictions. Accordingly, denial of acquittal was proper. Use of an advisory jury for a penalty recommendation was proper, and there was no error in the penalty phase instructions. The aggravating circumstances under Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;921.141(5) of avoiding arrest, prior violent convictions, heinous, atrocious, and cruel conduct, and during commission of a burglary were supported by the evidence and outweighed any mitigation. The death sentences were not unconstitutional and they were proportional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and sentence by the Circuit Court in and for Lake County (Florida), for kidnapping, sexual battery using force likely to cause serious injury, and first-degree murder, for which he received a sentence of death. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the guilty verdicts on the charges of kidnapping, sexual battery, and murder were not supported by the evidence and that the trial court did not have jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was physical evidence and eyewitness testimony, as well as defendant's statements, which linked defendant to the victim at the time of the murder. The jury was entitled to draw an inference that defendant acknowledged his guilt from his statement that he &quot;must have did it.&quot; Thus, the case was not entirely circumstantial. As a circuit court had original jurisdiction over a murder, the trial court properly denied the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Although defendant was handcuffed and transported in the back of a police cruiser, those measures were taken for the safety of the police officers involved and the police removed the handcuffs as soon as defendant reached the sheriff's office. Nothing in the record indicated that defendant objected to being handcuffed or at any time expressed a desire to terminate the encounter. Thus, a reasonable person in defendant's position would have felt free to terminate the encounter with police. While the methods employed as to the identification were highly suggestive, the procedures did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Defendant's death penalty was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After reviewing defendant's many challenges, the instant court found no error. First, his voluntary confession provided a basis to seize the physical evidence. Thus, suppression was unwarranted. Second, the evidence did not support the withdrawal of counsel. Third, the victim impact evidence was admissible as limited by Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;921.141(7). Fourth, a medical examiner properly testified in place of an unavailable colleague, after he reviewed the autopsy reports, photos, and notes and had spoken with said colleague. Fifth, a mistrial was properly denied, as a curative instruction cured any error. Sixth, defendant's motion to disqualify the trial judge was legally insufficient. Next, photos of the wounds inflicted were relevant to show their extent, depicted the medical intervention necessary to save the victim's life, and also helped to put defendant's actions in context. Further, the evidence surrounding both deaths supported the witness elimination and avoid arrest aggravators, and the trial court gave proper weight to the evidence in mitigation. Finally, the death sentences were proportional and Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;921.141 conformed with the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that it had approved a procedure nearly identical to the one here. As the trial court had not erred, counsel was not deficient. Next, any failure of counsel to advise petitioner that he had the right to testify during the penalty phase of his trial was not prejudicial because of petitioner's diminished credibility with the jury and the fact that his testimony would have been cumulative to the extensive mitigation evidence. The court next held that because there was no testimony as to mitigating factors under Fla. Stat. &sect; 921.141(6)(b) and (e), trial counsel was not deficient in failing to request jury instructions on statutory mitigation. Finally, had appellate counsel raised the issue of the constitutionality of Florida's capital sentencing scheme, it likely would have been denied because of the nonretroactivity of a United States Supreme Court decision and because of the presence of a prior violent felony aggravating circumstance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defense counsel was not deficient to failing to order an additional psychological evaluation when petitioner stated that he planned to represent himself during the penalty phase. Nothing suggested that petitioner lacked the ability to consult with his attorney or a factual understanding of the proceeding against him. Next, counsel was not deficient for refusing to file a motion to suppress that would have been frivolous. Counsel also was not ineffective for refusing to call certain witnesses and for limiting cross-examination of others for strategic reasons. Next, as petitioner represented himself during the penalty phase, he could not hold counsel deficient for not presenting mitigating evidence. The trial court had followed the procedures required to ensure that he had knowingly waived his right to present mitigation. Finally, because jury selection occurred after Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.180(a)(4) was amended, petitioner's right to participate in a sidebar conference was satisfied because he was present in the courtroom while his counsel participated in the conference. Thus, counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise this issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying petitioner's motion for postconviction relief. It denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

Third, counsel was not ineffective by failing to adequately contest the trial court's application of the pecuniary gain aggravating circumstance. Fourth, defendant failed to allege any overt act or error that might have prejudiced the jury and supported an inquiry into the validity into their verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing the postconviction relief motion, the instant court first held that no per se disqualification rule required circuit-wide disqualification necessary to preserve judicial impartiality.

Third, the trial court properly refused to review a detective's notes of an interview conducted with the inmate, as they were irrelevant to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim and were beyond the scope of direct examination. Fourth, the inmate's numerous ineffective assistance of counsel claims, for the most part, lacked merit, and even if they had merit, the inmate failed to show prejudice. Finally, habeas relief was denied, as: (1) hearsay evidence admitted to discuss a prior crime in the penalty phase was not fundamental error; (2) two photographs related to a Tallahassee shooting were relevant, and even if the were not, their admission was harmless; (3) an error in instructing the jury on both premeditated and felony murder was harmless; and (4) his Ring v.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) declared Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;390.0111 invalid, upholding the imposition of a temporary injunction by the Palm Beach County Circuit Court enjoining enforcement of the Woman's Right to Know Act, Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;390.0111 (2005) and its entry of summary judgment in favor of respondent clinic. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the State's appeal, the clinic posed two vagueness challenges to the statute. The instant court rejected them both, reasoning that Fla. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;390.0111(3)(a)(1)(a) required doctors to inform patients as to what a generalized, nondescript, abstract, and hypothetical reasonable patient would consider material when providing the informed consent information. Second, the court adopted the State's interpretation of the &quot;reasonable patient&quot; language as involving the patient who was presenting herself for the procedure. Thus, the doctor need only consider, address, and inform based on that patient's individualized circumstances in determining what information was material. Further, it would be illogical to require physicians who perform this treatment to provide the identical standardized information to every patient, even when that information would be completely irrelevant to the patient's individual circumstances. Second, &sect; 390.0111(3)(a)(1)(a) did not encompass non-medical risks, but was a neutral informed consent statute, comparable to the common law and informed consent statutes implementing the common law that existed for other types of medical procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the Fourth District was reversed, and the case was remanded. As a result, the award of attorney's fees to the clinic was vacated.</SPAN></P>

Further, while the prosecutor came dangerously close to using victim impact evidence as a nonstatutory aggravator, his statements in closing argument were not improper. Second, claims that Florida's capital sentencing procedures were unconstitutional were procedurally barred, and his &quot;innocent of the death penalty claims&quot; lacked merit because he did not demonstrate that each aggravating circumstance supporting his death sentence was invalid. Third, because Ring was decided after defendant's convictions became final, it was inapplicable. Finally, habeas relief was denied, as no objections were made at trial to the prosecutor's closing arguments, and said comments did not rise to the level of fundamental error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two men murdered three victims; the crime was videotaped by a security camera. The high court held that an officer's testimony about witnesses' prior identifications of defendant as one of the men in the video should not have been admitted as substantive evidence under Fla. Stat. &sect; 90.801(2)(c), as the witnesses were not victims of or witnesses to the crimes. But the error was harmless in view of the other identification evidence. Expert testimony about footprint evidence was not based on novel science and thus was not subject to Frye analysis. A taped conversation was properly excluded under Fla. Stat. &sect; 934.06 (1999), as there was no evidence that one of the parties to the conversation consented to its being recorded, as required by Fla. Stat. &sect; 934.03(2)(d) (1999). An officer who testified about defendant's reluctance to talk had not commented on his invocation of the right to remain silent. As a pre-arrest investigatory lineup was not a critical stage of the proceedings, he had not been entitled to counsel. The evidence established the &quot;cold, calculated, and premeditated,&quot; &quot;heinous, atrocious, or cruel,&quot; and &quot;avoid arrest&quot; aggravators. The death sentences were proportional.</SPAN></P>

Finally, the inmate failed to establish either Strickland prong to support his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. As to the habeas petition, the court found that: (1) the trial court did not violate the inmate's right to the effective assistance of counsel; (2) claims that the inmate's due process rights in his direct appeal were violated because of State's failure to disclose facts pertinent to his direct appeal were procedurally barred because they were or should have been litigated on direct appeal or were or should have been brought in his postconviction relief motion; (3) prior convictions of one of the inmate's own witness's were a matter of public record, and not concealed by the State; and (4) Ring did not apply retroactively against the inmate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's neighbors were beaten to death; their bodies were found in their apartment. He was a frequent visitor to their apartment. There was no direct evidence of his guilt. The entire circumstantial case presented against him consisted of (1) his fingerprint located on a waterbed frame near one victim's body, with no evidence presented as to when or how the fingerprint was left; and (2) one hair found on that victim's hand consistent with defendant's arm hair, with no evidence to ascertain if the hair was pulled out prematurely or naturally shed, and with that hair being only one out of six total arm hairs found in the victim's hand and among hundreds of hairs found at the crime scene. The high court held that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he robbed and killed the victims. The evidence was not inconsistent with his hypothesis of innocence -- that he was not guilty, and that someone else, perhaps a member of a gang that had shot into the victims' apartment a week before the murders, was guilty. The hair and fingerprint could just as well have been left at the apartment during one of defendant's numerous innocent visits to the premises as during the murders.</SPAN></P>

Later, defendant would not let him in and said he was going to kill himself. The roommate called 911. When police responded, defendant opened the door slightly, told them he was &quot;okay,&quot; and shut the door. When he finally opened the door again, police forced their way in. Through an opened bathroom door, an officer saw a severed foot. The victim's body was dismembered; DNA in semen found in her vagina was consistent with defendant's. The high court held that the warrantless entry was justified by exigent circumstances, as police were not investigating a crime but were attempting to ensure that defendant would not kill himself. The State's asking experts if intercourse occurred after death did not require a mistrial. The prosecution did not bolster a witness's alibi. As the trial court sustained the objection to a question as to whether defendant hustled money from &quot;gay guys,&quot; and gave a curative instruction, a mistrial was not required. Substantial evidence supported the conviction. The death sentence was proportionate. Defendant's prior violent felonies, an aggravating factor, fulfilled Ring v. Arizona's mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Up for review was a decision rendered by the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida), specifically involving defendant, which was certified as directly in conflict with a separate decision in the Third District that didn't involve defendant, which held that the reasonableness of a search after arrest was not affected by the fact that the original stop made might have been without probable cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conflict issue presented was: where there was no reasonable cause to justify a traffic stop, could an outstanding arrest warrant constitute an intervening circumstance that dissipated the taint of the illegal action, so that evidence uncovered during a search incident to arrest was admissible in evidence? The instant court first agreed with defendant that a stop for a violation of motor vehicle laws was similar to a Terry investigative detention and could be made when there was founded suspicion. But, a search incident to an outstanding warrant was sufficiently attenuated from the illegality of the original stop so as not to be sufficiently tainted by it to be the fruit of the poisonous tree, regardless of whether the standard for the original stop was probable cause or founded suspicion. Here, the brief amount of time that elapsed between the illegal stop and defendant's arrest weighed against finding the search attenuated. But, the outstanding arrest warrant was an intervening circumstance that weighed in favor of the firearm found in a search incident to the arrest being sufficiently distinguishable from the illegal stop so as to be purged of the stop's primary taint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the Fourth District was quashed, and the conviction and sentence imposed against defendant were ordered reinstated.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that because the trial court did not have the benefit of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.203 when it denied a hearing on mental retardation, the court did not err in denying him post-conviction relief, but he could still file a Rule 3.203 motion for a determination of mental retardation as a bar to execution in the trial court and was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on that motion. His claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were denied. As to his habeas corpus petition, the trial court found the aggravating circumstances of a prior violent felony conviction, based on the contemporaneous murder of the victim, and that the murder was committed during the course of a burglary and a kidnapping. A unanimous jury found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of these offenses. He was not entitled to postconviction relief on his Ring claims.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied several motions relating to discovery and public records requests, and it denied the inmate's motion to vacate judgments of conviction and sentences pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851(h)(5). On appeal, the court found no error in denial of an evidentiary hearing as to a claim of newly discovered evidence, as contradictory statements by a witness, even if true, would not probably produce an acquittal on retrial. There was no merit to the alleged Brady violation, as it was uncertain whether the uncorroborated assertion of the witness was even made. Defendant's claims that a lethal injection violated the First and Eighth Amendments lacked merit, as they were based on the improper administration of sedatives, and there was no evidence of such misconduct. There was no entitlement to the public records requested under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.852(h)(3).</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 27.711 (2005), counsel for appellee death row inmate sought attorney fees from appellant Florida Department of Financial Services for work done on a petition for writ of certiorari filed in the United States Supreme Court. The Circuit Court in and for Duval County, Florida, granted counsel all the fees he requested; the Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court appointed counsel to represent the inmate in his appeal from the trial court's denial of postconviction relief. After the state supreme court denied relief, counsel filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. The Department argued that counsel's fee request was unreasonable and that under &sect; 27.711(4)(g), fees had to be limited to $ 2,500, plus applicable costs. The trial court awarded almost $ 28,000 in fees. The state supreme court held that the record did not adequately establish that unusual or extraordinary circumstances sufficiently existed in order to warrant compensation in excess of the statutory cap. No experts testified on behalf of counsel regarding what would have been a reasonable fee, or whether the case presented an extraordinary or unusual situation requiring fees in excess of the statutory amount. There was thus no competent, substantial evidence to support the trial court's decision. The court rejected counsel's constitutional challenges to &sect; 27.711, as he raised them for the first time on appeal and it had previously ruled that statutory fee caps in death penalty cases were not facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) affirmed the circuit court's convictions entered against petitioner of two counts of forgery, two counts of uttering a forged instrument, and one count each of driving with a suspended license and giving false information to a police officer. After a conflict of that decision was certified with a First District decision, the instant matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second District addressed petitioner's contention that the forged traffic citations were inadmissible pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.650(9) (2001), and that when the deputy issuing the citation learned that petitioner was not the person he said he was, but had signed that person's name, the deputy withdrew the charges and retained the documents as evidence of the forgery. Thus, it determined that the charges were no longer pending and the citations served as documentary evidence of petitioner's criminal conduct. In contrast, the First District's decision stating that the statute was unambiguous and not subject to judicial interpretation missed the mark in holding that citations should not be admissible in any trial under any circumstances. Further, its interpretation of &sect; 316.650(9) essentially eradicated all prosecutions for forgery of a traffic citation, because in order to convict someone of forgery, the State had to specifically prove that the allegedly forged document was in fact a &quot;public document&quot; and was therefore actionable under the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Appellate Court found that Florida was prohibited by Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(a) from expending public funds to allow students to obtain a private school education in kindergarten through grade 12 as an alternative to a public school education. In so ruling, it found Fla. Stat. &sect; 1002.38 (2005), authorizing school vouchers to pay for the private education, to be unconstitutional. Appellant governor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee concerned citizens filed complaints in the trial court challenging the constitutionality of a program, the Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), that permitted Florida to pay a student's tuition at a private school to allow the student to attend that school in a case where the student was attending a public school that was failing to meet certain minimum state standards. The OSP was codified at Fla. Stat. &sect; 1002.38 (2005), and the concerned citizens challenged it on various constitutional grounds, including Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(a), which governed the provision of public education to students in Florida. The trial court entered final summary judgment in favor of the concerned citizens and declared the OSP to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment and agreed that the OSP was unconstitutional. On further review, the state supreme court found that Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1(a) mandated the provision of education through a free, uniform public school system and that the OSP's diversion of public money to the private school system that did not have to meet uniform educational standards violated that constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed, holding that the property in question was being used by the city for a municipal purpose and that the legislature's attempt to condition the provision of those municipal services on the payment of an amount equal to any ad valorem tax liability was in direct conflict with Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(a). The court, upon reviewing the applicable statutes and the meaning being various terms such as municipal purpose, held that providing telecommunications services did not, as a matter of law, always serve municipal or public purposes and, therefore, ad valorem taxation of a municipality's telecommunications facilities was not facially unconstitutional. The court agreed that telecommunications services were essential services but that, in providing those services, a municipality did not as a matter of law engage in an activity essential to the welfare of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prisoner appealed the order of the Circuit Court in and for Walton County (Florida), which denied the prisoner's motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The prisoner also petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus. The prisoner was under sentence of death as a result of his conviction for first-degree murder. He was also convicted of kidnapping and robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner's conviction arose from the murder of a woman with whom he had been playing pool earlier in the evening at a bar. The bar was robbed, and it was believed that the prisoner killed the woman to avoid having a witness to the robbery. The stolen cash was found at the prisoner's home, and tire tracks matching his vehicle were found at the location where the victim's body was found. Also, the victim's blood was found on the prisoner's shirt, and the victim's palm and fingerprints were found in his vehicle. The prisoner raised 28 issues on appeal, primarily asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. The court found no merit in the prisoner's claim that the State violated Giglio by using false and misleading testimony of two inmates who were in his same jail cell awaiting trial since there was no evidence that the inmates were planted or in any way State agents. An alleged Brady error as to a memo from the medical examiner expressing concern that the time of death may have occurred after the prisoner was taken into custody was also meritless because the evidence presented at the postconviction hearing showed that defense counsel was in actual possession of the note.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's denial of the prisoner's postconviction motion as well as denied his petition for habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised nine points on appeal. The appeals court first held that defendant's claims relating to the guilt phase of his trial, individually relating to a conflict of interest, alleged discovery violation, a Brady violation, and allegations of improper and inflammatory remarks by the prosecution, lacked merit. But, the trial court erred in permitting the jury to render only a single, undifferentiated advisory sentence rather than individualized advisory sentences for each capital murder conviction. The jury's recommendation did not individually address the two capital murder convictions for which defendant was to be sentenced, and said error was not harmless, because the potential for unreliability in the imposition of the death penalty was too great.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed, but the death sentences were reversed, and the case was remanded for a new penalty- phase proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Florida Department of State, Division of Elections, sought review of a declaration by the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) that Fla. Stat. ch. 101.253(2) (2004) was unconstitutional. The issue was whether Fla. Stat. ch. 101.253(2), which gave the Department absolute discretion to allow a candidate to withdraw after the 42nd day before an election, violated the separation of powers principle set forth in Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A candidate qualified with the Department as the Democratic Party candidate for a congressional district in the general election. Forty days before the election, the candidate sought to withdraw. The Department, relying on Fla. Stat. ch. 101.253(2), notified the candidate that his request to withdraw was denied. Thereafter, appellee Democratic Party Executive Committee sought a mandatory injunction requiring the Department to declare that a vacancy had been created by the candidate's withdrawal and to comply with Fla. Stat. ch. 100.111(4)(b) (2004). The trial court concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 100.111(4)(b) controlled the procedure for allowing a candidate's withdrawal and filling a vacancy in nomination and granted injunctive relief. The supreme court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 101.253(2) vested the Department with absolute, unfettered discretion to decide whether to grant or deny a candidate's request to withdraw after the 42nd day before an election. Thus, Fla. Stat. ch. 101.253(2) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in violation of the separation of powers set forth in Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing defendant's postconviction relief motion, the instant court found that the claims therein lacked merit, as defense counsel did not concede defendant's guilt and defendant failed to establish that any unprecedented mitigation, which would have assisted him at sentencing, actually existed. Second, the trial court made findings in summarily denying the Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 motion, and also adopted and incorporated by reference the State's response to defendant's motion, making for meaningful appellate review. As to the habeas request, internal police records were not admissible; therefore, appellate counsel could not be deemed deficient for failing to raise the issue. Moreover, because defendant was convicted of attempting to commit a forcible felony, he was barred from asserting self-defense. Also, counsel testified to extensive preparation for trial and the potential penalty phase. Finally, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the trial court's denial of a cause challenge to a juror and for denial of adequate peremptory challenges, as defendant failed to establish that counsel acted deficiently or that such deficiency prejudiced him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1974, the inmate was convicted of shooting the two victims to death during a robbery and was sentenced to death. On appeal of the trial court's judgment, the inmate contested the summary denial of the majority of his postconviction claims. The court affirmed, holding that there was no error in the trial court's determination that summary denial was appropriate. The court found that the inmate's claims were either procedurally barred, conclusively refuted by the record, facially or legally insufficient as alleged, or without merit as a matter of law. The court further held that the inmate was not entitled to habeas corpus relief on his claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to raise on appeal the issue of the State's failure to resentence the inmate within a reasonable period of time because it concluded that the inmate was responsible, in part, for the delay in resentencing. The court also denied the inmate relief on his claim that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to ensure that a complete record was compiled on appeal because the record did in fact contain the allegedly omitted portions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court in and for St. Lucie County (Florida), which convicted defendant of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. Defendant was found guilty of murder, burglary, and robbery with a deadly weapon. The convictions arose against defendant and another from the stabbing of defendant's wife's aunt, and the removal of property from her residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's case and his accomplice's case were severed prior to trial pursuant to stipulation. Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the statements he made to a police detective because the detective implied that defendant was free to leave when he in fact knew that there was an outstanding felony arrest warrant for defendant at the time of the interview. The court found no error and held that, in the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, defendant's statement was made voluntarily in that defendant was given breaks, food, and was allowed to sleep, which contradicted any contention that his waiver was not voluntary. The court did find error, however, with regard to the application of the heinous, atrocious, or cruel fashion (HAC) factor to defendant because there was no eyewitness testimony that defendant struck the victim. Given there was no evidence establishing that defendant directed or otherwise knew that the victim would be killed or the manner of death, the trial court erred in applying the HAC aggravator to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but vacated the death sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for a new penalty phase proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) held that defendant's election in 2001 to be sentenced under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.001(4)(b)(1) (2001), also known as the 1983 guidelines, or Fla. Stat. ch. 921.002 (2001), also known as the Criminal Punishment Code (CPC), was an election to be resentenced according to the CPC. This decision conflicted with one from the instant court in 1989. Thus, this matter followed to address the conflict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question before the instant court was which sentencing provision applied to defendant's election: Fla. Stat. ch. 921.001(4)(b)(1) (2001) or Fla. Stat. ch. 921.002 (2001). Defendant argued that, like the appellant in Smith, his election was to be sentenced according to the 1983 guidelines. The instant court held that he was correct. The Second District's reliance upon Smith to reach its conclusion that defendant's election to be sentenced under the 1983 guidelines was an election to be sentenced under the CPC was erroneous, as a defendant who elected to be sentenced under the guidelines elected to be sentenced under the guidelines in effect at the time of the election. Under the facts herein, defendant's crime were committed prior to July 1, 1984, the effective date of the 1983 guidelines. Finally, the Second District also erred in concluding that the CPC applied to defendant, as defendant's offenses were not committed on or after October 1, 1998. The pertinent date was the date the offenses were committed, not the date of sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the Second District was quashed, and the matter was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from the murder of a man who was moving into an apartment complex that defendant allegedly assisted. The jury recommended the death penalty, and the trial judge sentenced defendant to life in prison on the robbery conviction, five years on the grand theft conviction, and death for the murder conviction. Defendant asserted that his counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase of his trial by spending only 11 hours preparing, by failing to conduct a thorough investigation, and by not providing any mitigating circumstances. The court disagreed and held that defendant's trial counsel had the full benefit of information obtained by the public defender's office, which included matters pertaining to defendant's background and upbringing. Since that information contained in the public defender's file was reviewed and considered by defendant's trial counsel, the investigation was not inadequate nor unreasonable. The court also noted that defendant's asserted mitigating evidence was cumulative. Other arguments asserted by defendant were found meritless or procedurally barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After making a decision on a petition for writ of certiorari, the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida), certified two questions on whether a trial court departed from applicable law by: (1) requiring the State to provide pre-guilt or pre-penalty phase notice of aggravating factors to be used for capital punishment; and (2) requiring the jury to use a special verdict form detailing the jurors' determination concerning aggravating factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for capital murder. He challenged the constitutionality of the death penalty. That challenge was denied, but the trial court imposed requirements that included the State providing advanced notice of the aggravators it intended to rely on and a special verdict form requiring jurors to detail their voting on the aggravators. The State sought certiorari review and the lower appellate court held that the first requirement was improper, but the second was proper. Considering the potential that each decision had to depart from established law, the court certified the two questions for review. The court held that the provision of notice by the State was not a substantial departure from its existing disclosure obligation and was not an undue burden on the State. Moreover, there was no requirement that the State provide such notice, but a trial court could, in its discretion, require it. However, the special jury verdict form imposed an additional statutory factor on Fla. Stat. &sect; 921.141 of a majority on a specific aggravator when only a majority of the jury finding any aggravating factor was required. Therefore, the special verdict form was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the decision and remanded to deny certiorari on that portion of the order requiring the State to provide notice of aggravators, but to grant certiorari and quash the order requiring a special verdict form to the jury. The court answered the first question &quot;no&quot; and the second question &quot;yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

That decision held that a testimonial hearsay statement was inadmissible at trial unless the declarant was shown to be unavailable and the party against whom the statement was admitted had an opportunity for cross-examination. However, the court in the habeas proceeding found that the United States Supreme Court decision did not apply retroactively. The new procedural rule could have only applied retroactively if retroactive application was deemed necessary. The rule's purpose was not to improve the accuracy of trials or even to improve the reliability of evidence. The old rule was relied on for over 20 years, and much testimonial hearsay was admitted under the old rule. The administration of justice would have been greatly affected by retroactive application which would have destroyed the stability of the law, rendered punishments uncertain and therefore ineffectual, and burdened the judicial machinery, fiscally and intellectually, beyond any tolerable limit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a former police officer, took an 11-year old girl to a lake, raped her, and killed her. The evidence was circumstantial: tire tracks at the scene matched the ones on defendant's car, defendant's and the victim's fingerprints were commingled on the hood of defendant's patrol car, and defendant's pubic hair was found in the victim's underpants. One of the State's witnesses recanted her testimony, recanted portions of her recantation, and then invoked the privilege against self-incrimination. The state supreme court held, inter alia, that because the witness would not testify, the purported change in her testimony was unlikely to result in a different verdict. Although the case against defendant was circumstantial, strong evidence besides the witness's testimony linked him to the murder. Trial counsel was not ineffective for stipulating to consolidation of the charges under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.150(a) since the offenses were committed by the same person on a single victim in a single episode. Therefore, the trial court properly denied defendant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed, and defendant's petition for habeas corpus relief was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Appeal, Second District (Florida), certifed direct conflict with five opinions of the District Court of Appeal, First District (Florida), on the issue of whether the failure of a sentencing court to provide written reasons for retaining jurisdiction, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 947.16(3)(a) (Supp. 1978), constituted an illegal sentence for Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The second district had ruled that the failure to provide written reasons for retaining jurisdiction did not constitute an illegal sentence and thus Rule 3.800(a), which allowed for challenge's to illegal sentences at any time, did not apply. The supreme court agreed, noting its approval of the second district's analogy to cases in which a trial court failed to provide written reasons for sentencing departures. Neither failure was of the magnitude necessary to constitute an unlawful sentence. Thus, the court approved the second district's decision and disapproved the decisions in Kirtsey v. State, 855 So. 2d 177 (Fla. 1st Dist. Ct. App.  2003); Hernandez v. State, 825 So. 2d 513 (Fla. 4th Dist. Ct. App.  2002); Bingham v. State, 813 So. 2d 1021 (Fla. 1st Dist. Ct. App.  2002); Thames v.

The trial court granted the travel agency's motion to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration. The Court of Appeals of Florida for the Fourth District reversed the decision, and certified a question of great public importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother signed a commercial travel contract with the travel agency for an African safari on behalf of herself and her son.

The father alleged that the mother did not have legal authority to contract away their son's substantive rights through the arbitration clause. The appellate court ruled that the child's estate could not be bound to arbitrate tort claims arising from the safari. The state supreme court found that it was not foreclosed by 9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2 (2000) of the Federal Arbitration Act from determining the enforceability of the arbitration agreement solely on public policy grounds under Florida law. The court further held that the arbitration provision in the contract was not unconscionable, in violation of any statutory prohibition, or void as against public policy. Because the mother had authority to enter into the contract on behalf of her minor child, pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. 14 and Fla. Stat. art.

Petitioner then went inside, shot the victim in the head, and slashed the victim's throat. He then slashed the throat of the victim's wife. He was found guilty of, inter alia, two counts of first-degree murder. The trial court followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced him to death. On appeal, his death sentence was affirmed. The postconviction court then denied his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 petition for postconviction relief. On further review, the state supreme court found that one of his claims of error was procedurally barred because it had not been raised in the postconviction court. It also found he did not show that the jury knew he was shackled at trial, he did not show that he received ineffective of assistance of counsel at trial, and he did not show that he was entitled to relief on his Brady claim. It also denied his petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

Mortality and life expectancy were irrelevant to limitations on the terms of incarceration set by the legislature for criminal misconduct. It was abundantly clear that the legislature, by prescribing a sentence of life imprisonment, intended that the defendant remain in prison for the rest of his life. The term &quot;life&quot; was sufficiently definite so that it could have been understood and applied. There was nothing indefinite about such a sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) found that a statute requiring property appraisers to place no assessed valuation on real property if improvements to it were not substantially completed by January 1st was unconstitutional. Thus, it affirmed the trial court's summary judgment grant to appellee property appraiser, who claimed that the statute violated Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4. Appellant property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's condominium project was in the final stages of construction as of January 1, 1997. The property appraiser determined that it was substantially complete as of that date and assessed the property at a certain valuation. The property owner filed suit and argued that under Fla. Stat. ch. 192.042(1) (1997), the improvements to the property should have been assessed no value because the condominium was not &quot;substantially complete&quot; on January 1, 1997. The property appraiser raised as an affirmative defense that the statute violated Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, directing the legislature to prescribe regulations securing a just valuation of property and, was, therefore, unconstitutional. The trial court concluded the statute was unconstitutional and granted summary judgment in the property appraiser's favor. The appellate court affirmed. On further review, the property owner raised for the first time the issue of whether the property appraiser had standing to challenge the statute. The state supreme court found that the issue of standing was waived for the property owner's failure to raise it earlier and that the statute did not violate the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded to the appellate court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he also sought habeas corpus relief on multiple grounds of alleged ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The court found that the Rule 3.851 motion was properly denied. Since the prisoner admitted to sexual contact with the victim, DNA evidence did not prove any fact in the case, so any error in not holding a Frye hearing was harmless. The trial court properly found trial counsel's testimony more credible than the prisoner's on whether the prisoner was properly prepared to testify. Whether the prisoner was mentally retarded and thereby not subject to capital punishment was sufficiently explored by the trial court, and the death penalty statute was not unconstitutional. As to habeas corpus relief, appellate counsel was not deficient for failing to raise meritless and unpreserved claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Florida Department of Revenue sought review of a decision of the District Court of Appeal, First District (Florida), which declared that Fla. Stat. ch. 193.016 (2001) violated the mandate of Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect;&nbsp;4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court had ruled that Fla. Stat. ch. 193.016 (2001) was unconstitutional because it interfered with a property appraiser's discretion to determine just value, and it favored tangible personal property owners who had received a reduced assessment from an administrative value adjustment board (VAB) in a previous tax year. The supreme court disagreed. Chapter 193.016 required an appraiser to consider the results of an appeal before VAB in the year prior in determining the current just value of tangible personal property. Fla. Stat. ch. 193.011 (2001) set out eight factors that were to be considered in valuing property. Fla. Stat. ch. 193.016 (2001) merely provided a ninth factor for consideration. It did not arbitrarily create a class of property for favored tax treatment. Further, ch. 193.016 did not require an appraiser to follow the VAB's assessment, it only required an appraiser to &quot;consider&quot; it. The statute's second sentence, which required an appraiser to justify his or her reasons for a decision to depart from a VAB assessment, simply regulated the procedural, not substantive, method of assessment where there had been a successful appeal to a VAB.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the appellate court's decision and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the supreme court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's motion for nonmonetary pretrial release was denied, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 907.041(4)(b) (2000), a judicial circuit's appellate division reviewed the matter and found that ch. 907.041(b)(4) was unconstitutional as a procedural rule which encroached on the Florida Supreme Court's exclusive rulemaking power. The State of Florida appealed. The Third District Court of Appeal of Florida affirmed the decision. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery that involved domestic violence. After defendant was brought before the county court for her first appearance, the county court found that defendant qualified for nonmonetary release to pretrial services because she had no prior offenses. Despite making a finding that defendant qualified, the county court found that it could not grant nonmonetary pretrial release pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 907.041(4)(b). The county court therefore set bond, and scheduled a second hearing. Defendant could not afford to post the bond, and remained in jail until the second scheduled appearance. The state supreme court found that, because ch. 907.041(4)(b) was unconstitutional, and because the Florida Legislature repealed those portions of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.131 and 3.132 that required trial judges to consider nonmonetary pretrial release at the first appearance hearing for defendants charged with dangerous crimes, including domestic violence, a vacuum existed concerning when trial judges could consider these defendants for nonmonetary pretrial release. Therefore, the court temporarily readopted Rules 3.131 and 3.132 in their entirety.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 843.085 (2001) unconstitutional as overbroad, vague, or in violation of the right of substantive due process? Petitioner individual had previously been convicted of violating the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was arrested for violating ch. 843.085(1) after she was observed wearing an official sheriff's department t-shirt, which she had purchased at a uniform store that was open to the public. The statute made it unlawful for unauthorized individuals to wear such clothing because it could deceive a reasonable person into believing that an individual was authorized by an official agency to display or wear it. Answering the certified question in the affirmative, the supreme court found ch. 843.085(1) to be unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;9, and in violation of substantive due process. The statute was overbroad because it did not contain any intent or scienter requirement. It made no distinction between innocent wearing or displaying of law enforcement indicia from that designed to deceive the reasonable public into believing that such display was official. The statute violated substantive due process because the imprecision in its language failed to give fair notice of what conduct it prohibited. Thus, the statute invited arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The inmate claimed that his counsel was ineffective in not presenting his former common-law wife and his mother to present mitigating evidence. Trial counsel presented three lay witnesses who testified about mitigating circumstances. Counsel also hired a neuropsychologist to investigate claims by the inmate that he had suffered brain damage. The appellate court held that defense counsel's decisions concerning mitigating evidence was reasonable trial strategy. The inmate's habeas corpus petition claimed that Florida's death penalty statutes were unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the inmate was not entitled to relief under the prior-conviction exception to the Apprendi rule as the aggravating circumstances included a prior violent felony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured employee was injured at work. He was transported to an emergency room and was found to have blood in his urine. Immediately following the injuries, he received medical care that was supervised and controlled by the carrier. Subsequently, the carrier denied authorization for examination or treatment by a urologist, asserting that the injury was not work-related. The carrier was again notified that emergency urological care was needed because the employee's urine had begun to smell like feces. The carrier intervened and actually blocked the employee's receipt of medication. Testing ultimately revealed that the employee had a hole in his bladder. The employee was forced to be seen by no fewer than six doctors in addition to his initial treating physician. Each of them concluded that his physical injuries were related to the initial accident and that his condition as a result required urgent surgical treatment. The supreme court held that the allegations went far beyond simple claim delay or a simple termination of benefits. The injuries at issue did not occur at the workplace, but the injuries were allegedly inflicted by the carrier during the claims handling process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to a weekend of crimes, which included the rape and murder of one victim and the murder and robbery of two other victims. Defendant was sentenced to death. The matter was remanded several times. Defendant was again sentenced to death in his fourth penalty phase proceeding. The appellate court held that all of defendant's postconviction issues were meritless. The trial court correctly denied defendant's Brady claim because he could not satisfy any of the elements of the Brady test. Any assertion that an expert could have mined the data underlying an EEG report to discover mitigating evidence pertaining to defendant's mental status was speculative at best and did not support the existence of a Brady violation. Defendant was similarly unable to establish that the State either willfully or inadvertently suppressed the EEG report. Finally, defendant could not satisfy the prejudice prong of the Brady analysis as the results of the EEG were normal. Defense counsel's failure to call the expert could be attributed to no other cause than the expert's clear intent not to testify. Any challenge to the restraint employed during the penalty phase was procedurally barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed judgments by the Circuit Court in and for Miami-Dade County (Florida) that denied his Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose from a shooting that occurred at a shopping center and an attempted home invasion robbery that occurred the following day. A doctor appointed to determine defendant's mental health concluded that despite a low intelligence quotient, he was competent to stand trial. The trial judge testified during the postconviction proceedings that he had received certain documents from the prosecution for an in-camera inspection and that the documents were subsequently lost. The state supreme court held that defendant's lack of cooperation undermined his allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant had no constitutional right to a jury determination of whether he was mentally retarded. Because the judge was not a material witness under Fla. Stat. ch. 38.02 (2004), Fla. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 3(E)(b), defendant's Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.160 motion to disqualify was properly denied. A unanimous jury found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the offenses, thereby satisfying the mandates of the United States and Florida Constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a prisoner under sentence of death, petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus. The prisoner argued that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the trial court's denial of a motion for the appointment of an additional mental health expert, that the trial judge's override of the jury's recommendation in favor of life was unconstitutional, and that the standard for jury override cases was arbitrarily applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found the prisoner guilty of first-degree murder and recommended a sentence of life imprisonment. However, the trial court rejected the jury's recommendation and imposed a sentence of death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed the jury override on appeal. Defense counsel's request that a specific expert be appointed was granted. Defense counsel's subsequent request that an additional expert be appointed was denied. The supreme court held that appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise that issue. Even if Ring called Florida's jury override procedures into question, the prisoner's nine prior violent felonies were an aggravating circumstance that took his sentence outside the scope of Ring's requirements. The record contained insufficient evidence to reasonably support the jury's recommendation of life. The victim, a fellow prisoner, was bound and died of blows to the back of the head. He received no less than 25 separate wounds. Blood was sprayed about the cell. Nothing in those facts supported self defense or acting in the heat of a fight. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the facts supported the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court in and for Pinellas County (Florida) denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief filed under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in overriding the jury's recommendation for a life sentence in imposing a death sentence, primarily relying on the Keen case. The appeals court disagreed. The singular focus was whether there was a reasonable basis to support the jury's recommendation of life, rather than the weighing process which a judge conducted after a death recommendation. The judge here, as in Keen, intermixed the standards for life and death recommendations. However, defendant failed to raise this claim in his present Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 motion. Thus, he was procedurally barred from raising it under the instant circumstances. Second, the court already addressed the applicability of Keen on collateral review and held that Keen was nothing more than an application of a long-standing analysis. Third, any error in this regard was harmless. Whereas in the Keen case, there was ample mitigating evidence on which the jury reasonably could have based a life recommendation, in defendant's case, there was none. Finally, defendant was not entitled to relief under Ring v. Arizona, as Ring did not apply retroactively in Florida.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was also denied relief on his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion. The First District Court of Appeal certified a question for review, and this matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The First District certified as a question of great public importance whether the rule announced in Apprendi applied retroactively. The instant court held that it did not because a retroactive application would require review of the record and sentencing proceedings in many cases simply to identify cases where Apprendi might apply. In every case Apprendi affected, a new jury would have to be empaneled to determine, at least, the issue causing the sentence enhancement.  Many, if not all, of the surrounding facts would have to be presented. In others, a jury would have to determine factors unrelated to the case. Finally, the instant court found it unpersuasive that courts unanimously considered Apprendi to be a rule of procedure that simply changed who decided certain sentencing issues. The right to a jury trial itself was not retroactive; thus, the instant court failed to see how a subset of that right, a jury determination of facts relevant to sentencing, could be retroactive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question was answered in the negative, and the decision of the First District was approved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first-degree murder conviction and death sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Two PCR motions were denied. Defendant filed a third PCR motion, claiming that his due process and equal protection rights were violated when public documents relevant to his case were improperly withheld, that his death sentence was unconstitutional under the Ring rule, and that execution by lethal injection constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The circuit court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing (EH). Defendant appealed. The court rejected the argument that an EH was required on the document claim since defendant did not explain how the documents would produce an acquittal and the circuit court conducted an appropriate in camera document review before summarily rejecting the claim. The Ring rule's mandate that a jury, not a judge, had to find every fact justifying a death penalty was a new rule. It did not apply retroactively to defendant since his conviction was final when the Ring case was decided. Finally, lethal injection was not cruel and unusual punishment, and the claim was procedurally barred because it was raised and rejected in a prior PCR proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Palm Beach County (Florida), which struck, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, defendant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 motion for postconviction relief (PCR) from convictions for murder and armed robbery and from a sentence of death and which, alternatively, denied the motion. Defendant also filed an original proceeding for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's timely PCR motion was struck for failure to satisfy the pleading requirements of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851. A subsequent amended motion was struck as untimely and was summarily denied on the merits. On appeal, the court found that the original motion should have been struck with leave to amend, which would have made the amended motion timely. Regardless, ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims lacked merit. Also, since he waived a jury for his penalty phase, defendant could not challenge the constitutionality of whether a judge, and not a jury, properly determined that sufficient death penalty aggravators existed. The court rejected a separate habeas corpus petition that was premised on ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. A confession was voluntary and was obtained after an arrest properly supported by probable cause, so failure to challenge whether it should have been suppressed was not erroneous. Even though an avoid arrest aggravator under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5)(e) (1997) lacked factual support, no prejudice occurred. The properly applied aggravators of a prior violent felony and a crime committed for pecuniary gain were sufficient to impose death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that striking defendant's PCR motion on subject matter jurisdiction grounds was improper, but the court affirmed the denial of the motion on the merits. The court also denied defendant's petition for habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in answering the jury's question with regard to when a life sentence without the possibility of parole would start.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived in a rented duplex apartment with his girlfriend. They rented the apartment from the victims. Defendant paid the victims $ 250 for back rent. After using drugs, defendant went over to retrieve the money to purchase additional drugs. The victims refused. Defendant admitted stabbing both of them to death. A neighbor heard someone going through the drawers. In sentencing defendant to death for each of the two homicides, the trial judge found three aggravating circumstances. The appellate court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in responding to the jury that defendant would receive credit for time served. It was notable that the trial court's answer was not detrimental and was actually favorable to defendant as it stated that parole was not a certainty. The trial court complied with the law in operation at the time defendant's sentence was rendered. The record demonstrated that application of the pecuniary gain aggravator was supported by competent, substantial evidence. Defendant waived any argument in regard to the burglary aggravator. Comparing the circumstances to other cases, the sentence of death was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) affirmed an order granting summary judgment to respondent, the Florida Department of Agriculture, in petitioner landowners' inverse condemnation action, finding that the landowners had no cause of action because the destruction of citrus trees located within 1900 feet of trees infected with citrus canker had no marketable value. Upon a certified question for review, the instant matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court certified the following of great public importance for review by the instant court: Did a Florida Supreme Court decision, which held that the Department of Agriculture's destruction of healthy commercial citrus nursery stock within 125 feet of trees infected with citrus canker did not compel state reimbursement, also apply to the Department's destruction of uninfected, healthy noncommercial, residential citrus trees within 1900 feet of trees infected with citrus canker? The instant court held that both the trial court and the district court decided the case on the basis of the statute and administrative rule in 2000, when the landowners' trees were destroyed. However, the 2002 statute clearly intended that the landowners be included with those affected homeowners covered by Fla. Stat. ch. 581.1845(2) in that their citrus trees were removed as part of a citrus canker eradication program after January 1, 1995. Thus, they were eligible to receive compensation pursuant to that statute, which was remedial in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) expressly declared Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(5)(b) (1999) constitutional after the county court found that said statute unconstitutionally violated petitioner doctor's rights to equal protection, due process, and access to the courts.  Petitioner insured and the doctor sought further review of the decision, which favored respondent insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners contended that the 30-day provision within Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(5)(b) (1999) violated their equal protection and due process rights and the right of access to the courts. The instant court disagreed. The intent of the statute was to impose time limits on the submission of medical bills under the no-fault scheme rather than adhere to the limitations period provided for breach of contract actions. There was a logical explanation for this intent as medical providers frequently provided ongoing medical treatment involving regular office visits. Because the different billing requirements were calculated to reduce unnecessary medical costs, which in turn lowered the costs upon which insurers based personal injury protection (PIP) premiums and ultimately benefitted consumers, ch. 627.736(5)(b) was rationally related to this legitimate purpose. Second, the analysis involved in the due process determination closely resembled that of the equal protection analysis. Thus, the instant court found no due process violation. Finally, the statute imposed a reasonable condition precedent to filing a claim for certain insurance benefits, and compliance preserved access to the courts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that all of the claims were facially insufficient, refuted by the record, or procedurally barred. As for the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase, the trial court found that defendant was evaluated at the time of trial for mental mitigation and that he failed to prove that he was prejudiced by the failure to present at the penalty phase the results of a psychological evaluation. Thus, his attorney was not ineffective for failing to have defendant evaluated. Nor was his attorney ineffective for failing to discover defendant's sexual orientation as there is no correlation between homosexuality and committing murder. Finally, the attorney presented mitigation evidence. The appellate court held the trial court did not err in its determinations.</SPAN></P>

Among other claims, the prisoner asserted that trial counsel should have presented expert testimony to show that it could not be established that the bullet which killed the victim came from the prisoner's gun and that counsel should have presented additional substantial mitigating evidence at the penalty phase. The appellate court held that there was conflicting evidence concerning the bullet issue. There was significant information that was never presented at sentencing which expounded upon both the abuse the prisoner suffered as a child and his mental infirmities. The appellate court held that the prisoner was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

The lower appellate court expressly declared valid Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(1) (1999) which mandated life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for persons convicted of capital sexual battery. The sole issue was whether such a sentence for oral union with the vagina of a girl under the age of 12 constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sexually assaulted an 11-year-old girl while she slept in the bedroom she shared with her siblings. Defendant was convicted violating Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2) (1999), sexual battery on a child under 12, and Fla. Stat. ch. 899.04(5)(b) (1999), lewd or lascivious molestation of a child under 12. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on the sexual battery charge, which was a mandatory sentence under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(1). Defendant argued the sentence was grossly disproportionate to his crime and therefore violated both U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The supreme court held that for a prison sentence to constitute cruel and unusual punishment solely because of its length, at a minimum the sentence had to be grossly disproportionate to the crime. Defendant failed to demonstrate gross disproportionality. Given the array of potentially lifelong harms associated with sexual abuse of children, the supreme court declined to second-guess the Florida Legislature's judgment that such a crime warranted a lifelong penalty. Thus, defendant's sentence did not violate Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 or U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court in and for Bay County (Florida), which denied his motion under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 for postconviction relief, in which defendant challenged his convictions for premeditated or felony murder, robbery, and sexual battery, and he challenged his sentence of death. Defendant also petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was linked to a brutal beating death of a woman. His defense to murder and rape charges was that he was drunk and on drugs when the incident happened, and that he could not form the requisite intent. He was convicted for the crimes and was sentenced to death after a penalty proceeding. After exhausting direct appeals, defendant moved for post-conviction relief on 25 grounds. The motion was denied and he appealed, raising three challenges along with a petition for habeas corpus relief. He argued that he was denied ineffective assistance of counsel for a failure to investigate or present evidence of his bipolar disorder, that his death sentence was unconstitutional, and that the general jury qualifications procedure used for his trial was unconstitutional. The court granted relief on the ineffective counsel claim because the presentation of defendant's bipolar disorder as mitigation would have likely affected the outcome of the penalty proceeding. However, the ineffectiveness did not affect the reliability of the guilt phase proceeding. The court had rejected defendant's constitutional challenge in prior cases and he had no right to be present at the jury qualifications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order denying postconviction relief on defendant's sentence of death and remanded for a new penalty phase proceeding. The court affirmed all other aspects of the order. The court also denied defendant's petition for habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, in appeals of two separate cases, challenged the constitutionality of the Florida Sexual Predators Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.21 (2003). In one case, the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) declared the Act constitutional, rejecting procedural-due-process and separation-of-powers challenges. In the other case, the Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) declared the Act unconstitutional on procedural-due-process grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the Florida Sexual Predators Act violated their rights to procedural due process, under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. This claim was based on the fact that the Act did not provide any procedure for determining in individual cases whether or not a person with an Act-qualifying conviction actually presented a danger to the community that would justify the imposition of the Act's requirements, particularly the Act's registration and public-notification requirements. The Supreme Court of Florida found that the Act did not violate procedural due process or separation of powers and, as against the challenges, was constitutional. The court declined to consider the substantive-due-process and equal-protection challenges briefed by the parties but not addressed by the courts below.</SPAN></P>

Affirming defendant's convictions and death sentence but vacating the sentence for sexual battery, the court held, inter alia, that (1) the State presented substantial evidence to establish identity and to show that the killing occurred during a sexual battery; (2) defendant's statements made to police after he requested assistance of counsel were properly admitted because defendant initiated the discussions; (3) even if defendant's consent to the taking of his blood was involuntary, the police had probable cause to arrest defendant and the blood sample would have been inevitably obtained; (4) the victim's statements made at the hospital were not hearsay because they were inconsistent with statements she made at the crime scene; (5) an officer's testimony that defendant stated that he thought he needed an attorney was isolated and there was no reasonable possibility that the testimony affected the jury verdict; but (6) the record demonstrates that no scoresheet was prepared for the noncapital offense of sexual battery, contrary to the provisions of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel during the penalty phase. The trial court first found that counsel adequately investigated the inmate's history of epilepsy. But, while counsel did not conduct a reasonable investigation of the inmate's mental health status, the inmate failed to show prejudice. Where the strongest evidence of mitigation was that the inmate was of low intelligence, such evidence did not affect the verdict, as the inmate's videotaped confession recounted the facts of the crime in detail, making it clear that the crime was both premeditated and deliberate. Second, counsel was not ineffective for failing to call the inmate's family members, where the inmate did not desire such. Third, the inmate failed to show sufficient evidence to warrant disqualification of the trial judge, or to justify overturning an order denying his motion to exclude an inmate counselor's testimony. Also, his supplemental claims lacked merit. Finally, the inmate was not entitled to habeas relief, as photographs of the victim were admissible, and counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise frivolous claims or for raising issues that were procedurally barred.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court found that the inmate's testimony would not have been admissible at trial, because it constituted inadmissible hearsay and the alleged confession was not admissible pursuant to the statement against interest exception to the hearsay rule because defendant had failed to demonstrate that the co-defendant was unavailable to testify. Lastly, the court found that the trial court properly determined that acquittal on retrial in light of all the other evidence, was virtually inconceivable, noting that defendant had bloodstains consistent with the victim's blood type on his shoes, and his fingerprints were on the murder weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that under Apprendi and Ring, a jury had to find the aggravating circumstances required to impose the death penalty. The state supreme court concluded that in cases that included a prior violent felony conviction as an aggravating circumstance, it had repeatedly rejected the argument that Apprendi and Ring required the jury, rather than the judge, to find the remaining aggravators. Defendant also argued that Florida's death penalty statute was unconstitutional because it did not require that aggravating circumstances be charged in the indictment. Again, the state supreme court had regularly rejected such claims where one of the aggravators was a prior violent felony conviction. Because defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered his plea, the trial court properly accepted it. The trial court thoroughly informed defendant about the rights he was waiving and defendant indicated both verbally and in writing that he understood. The trial court explained that defendant was entitled to a jury in both phases of the trial and that if he elected to waive his right to a jury, the judge alone would determine his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of trafficking in cannabis, the trial court, pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.620, adjudged him guilty of the lesser-included offense of possession with intent to sell. The State appealed. The Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) held that Fla. Stat. ch. 924.07(1) (2004) afforded it the right to hear the State's appeal and reinstated defendant's conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court reduced the charges under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.620 because it found the amendment to the trafficking statute unconstitutional. The court of appeals reversed, finding that the statute was constitutional. It also held that Fla. Stat. ch. 924.07 authorized a State appeal from a posttrial order reducing a charge pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.620 because an order reducing a charge set forth in the information or indictment to some lesser-included charge was, despite its label, an &quot;order dismissing the charge in the information.&quot; Thus, it was appealable under Fla. Stat. ch. 924.07(1)(a). The supreme court disagreed. Statutes affording the State the right to appeal in criminal cases had to be construed narrowly. The State's right to appeal a posttrial order reducing the charge had to be the product of express legislative authorization, not judicial extension of provisions authorizing State appeals in other circumstances; ch. 927.01(1) did not expressly authorize a State to appeal an order reducing the charge under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.620.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court quashed the court of appeal's decision to the extent it was inconsistent with the supreme court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Circuit Court in and for Madison County (Florida), which denied his motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, in which defendant challenged his convictions for first-degree murder, armed robbery, and armed kidnapping, and his sentence of death. Defendant also petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After escaping from prison, defendant severely beat a man, took his wallet, and fled in his truck. He was convicted for several crimes, including murder, and he was sentenced to death. He appealed the denial of his motion for postconviction relief, alleging that his counsel was ineffective and that the trial court erred by failing to rule on two of his claims. In a habeas petition, he argued that Florida's death penalty scheme was unconstitutional and that a decision requiring a jury to find the facts leading to death penalty aggravation applied retroactively to his case. The court found that counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the admission of habit testimony since there was no prejudice. Ample evidence supported the robbery conviction regardless of whether the habit testimony was improperly admitted. Also, defendant did not show that counsel failed to advise him of his right to testify and no prejudice existed since his proposed testimony did not show remorse. The two issues that the trial court did not rule on were procedurally barred. Finally, the court rejected defendant's arguments for habeas relief since it had rejected them in prior decisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying defendant's motion for postconviction relief. The court denied defendant's habeas petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for mistrial based on the prosecutor's opening statement. The prosecutor remarked that defendant said only two people knew what happened in the victim's apartment, so she had to reconstruct what happened with scientific and other evidence. The supreme court found this statement was a fair characterization of the evidence presented, and the jury was instructed numerous times during voir dire and the trial that the burden of proof rested solely on the State. The trial court also did not abuse its discretion when it barred evidence concerning marijuana cigarettes in the victim's apartment and the victim's boyfriend's marijuana use, as defendant failed to adequately connect either piece of evidence to a material fact in issue. Because defense witnesses had a potential motive to lie at trial, the trial court did not err when it allowed the State to impeach the witnesses with evidence that they were serving mandatory life sentences. Defendant never moved the trial court to withdraw his waiver of a penalty phase jury, so the claim could not be raised on direct appeal. The death sentence was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim had left work in a white SUV to pick up groceries for an office meeting. She never returned. Witnesses saw a white SUV driving to, and returning from, a wooded area. The victim's nude body was discovered two days later. She had been strangled. Defendant had shown up at his mother-in-laws house with a white SUV. The mother-in-law later found the victim's jewelry hidden on her property. Defendant drover around in an SUV which had been spray-painted black. An spray-painted SUV was later set on fire by the side of a road. During the trial, a corrections officer was allowed to testify that defendant had shaved his pubic hair just prior to a scheduled hair examination. The trial court allowed defendant's prior convictions as impeachment to defense counsel's questioning of the corrections officer. The appellate court held the facts provided a sufficient nexus upon which the trial court could base its exercise of discretion in admitting that evidence. Furthermore, defendant's explanation regarding jail conditions and crab lice went to the weight of the evidence, rather than its admissibility. The evidence supported the carjacking, kidnapping, robbery, and murder convictions.</SPAN></P>

The inmate wanted to test the woman's clothing and evidence in the sexual assault kit, along with his and the accomplice's blood, for DNA. He claimed that if DNA testing showed that the accomplice had also raped the woman, this would call into question the credibility of her testimony linking him to the premeditated murder of her brother. The appellate court noted that Rule 3.853 was not intended to be a fishing expedition. Under Rule 3.853, the inmate had to show a reasonable probability that DNA testing would exonerate him or mitigate his sentence.

The trial court held petitioner was entitled to a new penalty phase proceeding on petitioner's claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce available mental health mitigation that could have led the jury to recommend a life sentence. In the instant action, the supreme court found the trial court did not improperly shift the burden to the State to prove counsel was effective. A review of the court's order demonstrated that the trial court followed the proper procedure in determining that a new penalty phase was warranted. Petitioner satisfied the requirements of Strickland, and the record was devoid of any justification for counsel's failure to present the available evidence. As to petitioner's habeas claim, it was within the trial court's discretion to allow the use of a dummy as a demonstrative aid during one eyewitness's testimony, and the judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the use of the demonstrative aid. The death penalty was constitutionally imposed upon petitioner in light of the fact that the trial court properly applied the prior violent felony aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applied for a COE to have his criminal history record expunged. The FDLE denied his application and petitioner filed a petition in circuit court for expungement of all of his criminal history record information in light of his being pardoned by the governor and for a writ to require the FDLE to issue a COE. The circuit court ruled for the State, determining that the issuance of a pardon did not remove the historical fact that petitioner was convicted of kidnapping without ransom. Therefore, the FDLE properly denied the COE. The lower appellate court affirmed that decision. On review of those decisions, the court found that the lower appellate court correctly held that an individual who received a gubernatorial pardon was not entitled to a COE for records expunction pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 943.0585(2) (2000) because a pardon did not have the effect of eliminating guilt or the fact of conviction. The court approved of the decisions of the lower appellate court in line with that reasoning and disapproved other lower appellate court holdings that conflicted with that reasoning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Tampa and the City of Pinellas Park enacted similar juvenile curfew ordinances. In reviewing the ordinances, the lower appellate court initially applied intermediate or heightened scrutiny and ruled that both ordinances were constitutional. After remand, the lower appellate court concluded that, while the cities may have had a compelling governmental interest in controlling the whereabouts of juveniles during late night hours, the ordinances were not narrowly tailored to accomplish that goal by the least intrusive means available. The Florida Supreme Court concluded that the ordinances at issue did not implicate the juveniles' rights to free speech and assembly as those activities were specifically exempted from their ambit. It likewise concluded that the findings stated in the ordinances satisfied the compelling interest prong of the strict scrutiny test. It agreed with the lower appellate court that the ordinances were not &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; because the statistical data failed to establish the necessary nexus between the governmental interest and the classification created by the ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) applied a strict scrutiny standard and found that juvenile curfew ordinances enacted by the city councils of Tampa and Pinellas Park were unconstitutional. That appellate court then certified questions of great public importance to the state supreme court that asked whether those ordinances, in cases that were consolidated from each of the two cities, were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cities of Tampa and Pinellas Park enacted similar juvenile curfew ordinances. Respondent first juvenile was cited for violating the Tampa ordinance, while respondent second, third, and fourth juveniles were cited for violating the Pinellas Park ordinance. The State filed petitions for delinquency against the juveniles. The juveniles all moved to dismiss and argued the ordinances were unconstitutional. The respective trial courts came to different conclusions; eventually, the appellate court applied a strict scrutiny standard of review to the juveniles' cases. It then concluded that the juvenile curfew ordinances were unconstitutional. It found that the Tampa ordinance criminalized otherwise innocent conduct by a minor who had parental permission to be at a specified location. It also found the Pinellas Park ordinance was similar but even broader in its application. On further review, the state supreme court found that the ordinances were not &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; because their broad coverage included otherwise innocent and legal conduct by minors, even where they had the permission of their parents, and because the ordinances imposed criminal penalties for curfew violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified questions were answered in the negative, and the appellate court's decisions in the two cases were approved to the extent they were consistent with the state supreme court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer found defendant slumped over the wheel of a van after responding to a call of a vehicle parked at night in a normally abandoned area.

Defendant was arrested on an outstanding warrant. After defendant was transferred to another police vehicle, cocaine was found in the officer's cruiser at the spot where defendant was seated. Defendant moved to suppress that evidence, arguing the retention of his license after identification constituted an unlawful detention. The motion was denied and defendant was convicted. On appeal, the lower appellate court found that the consensual element of the encounter ended after the officer inspected the license and that the further detention violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. The State appealed. The supreme court found that, under the totality of the circumstances, the officer had a reasonable basis to investigate defendant. The computer check was justified because the officer had not eliminated all criminal suspicion of defendant's behavior.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant raised 13 issues, including reversible error when his challenge for cause was refused for a juror who was a former death row inmate guard. He argued that the juror acknowledged a bias against death row inmates and admitted a willingness to execute accused persons, thus raising a reasonable doubt as to his impartiality and justifying a challenge for cause under Fla. Stat. ch. 913.03(10) (2003). The court agreed, noting that the juror stated that if an accused person was convicted of prior crimes, he might automatically vote for the death penalty. The juror also stated that life imprisonment was not a severe enough punishment for a person convicted of premeditated murder and that since the homicide occurred inside a prison, his ability to serve impartially might be compromised. Defendant showed prejudice, justifying reversal, as he exhausted his peremptory challenges, he would have otherwise removed the objectionable juror with a peremptory challenge, and he was denied additional peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 101.048 (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Registered voters and labor organizations filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, alleging that the precinct-specific requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 101.048 (2004) were violative of the Florida Constitution. The matter was transferred and dismissed. Thereafter, the trial court denied relief on an amended complaint which sought declaratory and injunctive relief. On appeal, the matter was certified for review, based on a statement that it involved a matter of great public importance. Plaintiffs claimed that the challenged provision operated as an unnecessary restriction on the right to vote in violation of Fla. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, and that it imposed an additional qualification on the right of suffrage in violation of Fla. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2. The court noted that the traditional precinct-specific provision that applied to all voters was codified in Fla. Stat. ch. 101.045 (2004). There was no showing how that was distinguishable from the challenged provision, nor that Fla. Stat. ch. 101.048 imposed an unreasonable or unnecessary restraint on the elective process. The court upheld the statute's constitutionality against the challenge by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1983, defendant was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a parole supervisor. Defendant appealed the trial court's denial of his postconviction motion for relief and petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, raising claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The court affirmed the denial of postconviction relief and denied the petition for habeas corpus. The court found that defendant's resentencing counsel could not be deemed ineffective due to the fact that he did not present sufficient evidence to show that defendant's level of retardation met the criteria set forth in Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 921.137(1), the statute prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded defendants, because the statute did not even exist at the time of defendant's resentencing. The court also found that defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to object, under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.211(e), to the admissibility of an expert's testimony at defendant's resentencing, because the expert did not state that he had interviewed defendant for a determination of competency, instead, he testified that he examined defendant to evaluate his general intelligence and degree of learning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Florida District Court of Appeal, First District, which denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief. Defendant sought (1) resentencing to 80.1 months, the low end of the earlier sentencing guidelines; (2) to withdraw his plea in favor of a new plea agreement; or (3) to allow the State to withdraw from the original plea agreement and proceed to trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into a negotiated plea of nolo contendere and an agreed sentence based on his belief that the later sentencing guidelines were valid. He claimed that he entered into a plea at the top of the earlier guidelines in order to avoid a sentence under the harsher later guidelines and that he would not have entered into the plea had he known those guidelines were invalid. The trial court summarily denied defendant's motion after it noted that defendant negotiated for a sentence of imprisonment for a term of years and not for a &quot;minimum range&quot; guidelines sentence. The supreme court concluded that defendant's sentence was valid under the earlier sentencing guidelines and approved the lower appellate court's decision to affirm the trial court's order denying postconviction relief. After defendant was sentenced, the later guidelines were invalidated. Thus, they could not have legally superseded the earlier guidelines. Therefore, the earlier guidelines were still in effect and defendant's sentence was legal under those sentencing guidelines, and defendant was not adversely affected by reliance on the later guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Dade County Circuit Court (Florida) convicted defendant of armed robbery and resisting arrest, due to acts that occurred after the effective date of 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188, and sentenced him as an habitual offender under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 (1999), which was amended by 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188, &sect; 3. The Third District Court of Appeal certified a conflict with a case decided while an appeal was pending. This matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue in the instant action was the constitutionality of 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 known as the &quot;Three-Strike Violent Felony Offender Act&quot; (Act). The specific constitutional question presented was whether the provisions of the Act embraced but one subject and matter properly connected therewith as mandated by Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The instant court first determined that defendant had standing to assert a single-subject challenge, notwithstanding the fact that he was not directly affected by either &sect;&sect; 11 or 13 of the Act. Second, the court held that there was a natural or logical and thus proper connection between the requirements of &sect; 11 that sentences of non-citizen offenders be provided to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). This conclusion was buttressed by the fact that in requiring the transmission of sentences to the INS, &sect; 11 also promoted the Act's purpose of protecting the public from persons sentenced as serious or repeat violent offenders. Third, &sect; 13 made effective one of the purposes included within the subject--imposing harsher sentences on violent offenders. Thus, the provisions at issue did not violate the single-subject rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was upheld as non-violative of the single-subject rule.</SPAN></P>

But, five medical experts found that defendant was malingering. While one doctor opined that defendant might have a genuine psychosis, this conflict in the evidence was for the trial court to resolve. Defendant was also adequately informed prior to asserting his right to proceed pro se. He indicated that he understood the charges against him and that he understood the consequences of representing himself. He even had standby counsel available, whom he chose to present his closing argument. Further, the trial court properly conducted a Faretta hearing. As the trial court adequately addressed the concerns raised by defendant in representing himself, a continuance of his trial was unnecessary. Because defendant was given an opportunity to have a PET scan but refused to cooperate, relief on that issue was denied. After comparing similar capital cases, the sentence imposed was proportional. Finally, the court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to Florida's capital sentencing statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Pinellas County (Florida) held that 2003 Fla. Laws ch. 418, which prompted appellant governor to issue an executive order, was unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine, a person's right to privacy, and as retroactive legislation. The Second District Court of Appeal certified the case as one of great public importance requiring immediate resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor's executive order effectively reversed a properly rendered final judgment and amounted to an unconstitutional encroachment on the power reserved for the judiciary. Further, it inappropriately delegated legislative power to the governor. In all, 2003 Fla. Laws ch. 418 contained no guidelines or standards to limit the governor from exercising completely unrestricted discretion in applying the law. Further, the legislature failed to provide any criteria for lifting the stay. This absolute, unfettered discretion to decide whether to issue and then when to lift a stay made the governor's decision virtually unreviewable. Second, the legislation did not provide an additional layer of due process protection to those who were unable to communicate their wishes regarding end-of-life decisions. The law did not even require the governor to consider a patient's wishes, but instead allowed a unilateral decision by the governor to stay the withholding of life-prolonging procedures without any procedural process to the patient. Finally, the legislature's grant of authority to issue the stay under 2003 Fla. Laws ch. 418 was not a valid exercise of the state's parens patriae power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Executive Director of the Florida Department of Revenue, sought review of an order from the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal, which held that the homestead exemption cap in Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(c) applied to the increase in the assessed value of respondent homeowners' house from 2000 to 2001.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners did not apply for a homestead exemption until September 2001, after an appraiser notified them of an increase in their property taxes. In addition to filing for an exemption, they also sought to have the &quot;Save Our Homes&quot; cap in Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(c) applied to limit the increase in their assessment from 2000 to 2001. Their application was approved for 2001, but the appraiser did not reduce the 2001 assessment. The homeowners filed suit to challenge the county's refusal to apply the cap to the increase in the assessed value of their home from 2000 to 2001. The lower court held that the cap applied to homeowners who qualified for the exemption, not just to those who applied for it. On appeal, the court held that the grant of an exemption was necessary for a homeowner to obtain the baseline assessment for the cap. Hence, the homeowners were precluded from benefitting from the cap for the increase in their property taxes from 2000 to 2001. Their successful application for the exemption in 2001 constituted an establishment of the homestead, which triggered the baseline assessment for the cap. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 193.155 (2001), their baseline year was 2001.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the order of the lower court and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following certification of two questions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the appellate court considered whether restrictions on the manner in which religious decorations could be displayed on grave sites were constitutional or whether the restrictions merely inconvenienced the practices of plaintiffs, the owners and family members of those interred, of marking graves and decorating them with religious symbols.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city maintained a 21.5-acre cemetery for its residents. The city passed a regulation prohibiting vertical grave markers, memorials, monuments, and structures on cemetery plots. The regulation allowed individuals to place stone or bronze markers on plots provided that they were level with the ground surface. The owners argued that the imposition of such restrictions violated their right to free exercise of religion because they could not then place religious symbols on the vertical grave markers. However, the city's regulations did not prohibit the owners from marking graves and decorating them with religious symbols. Rather, the regulations permitted only horizontal grave markers. Those markers could have been engraved with any type of religious symbol. Moreover, out of consideration for mourners, vertical grave decorations were permitted for 60 days after the date of burial and for a few days around certain holidays. Accordingly, the prohibition on vertical grave decorations did not substantially burden the owners' exercise of religion within the meaning of the Florida Religious Freedom Restoration Act (FRFRA), 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 412, &sect;&sect; 1-6, 3297-98.</SPAN></P>

However, he did not present any evidence at the postconviction evidentiary hearing to demonstrate that he was in fact intoxicated at the time of the offense. Defendant failed to demonstrate that there was a reasonable probability that but for his counsel's unprofessional error, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Further, as to the claim that counsel was ineffective for not challenging a juror, at the conclusion of additional questioning and upon being provided appropriate criteria, the juror affirmed that he could follow the law and would not automatically vote for death simply upon the existence of a verdict of guilt. Finally, although counsel was admittedly not focused on the penalty phase from the outset or in the months prior to the start of the guilt phase trial, counsel began attempts to secure a mental health expert well before the penalty phase began.</SPAN></P>

However, all of the claims defendant raised had to be analyzed under the two-pronged test of Strickland. As to defendant's claim that his counsel was ineffective per se for conceding that he was guilty of first-degree murder without his consent, during voir dire and at trial, counsel repeatedly conceded that defendant was guilty of felony murder. In his opening statement, counsel conceded defendant had killed the victim, and he told the jury that the two issues for them to decide were whether the killing had been premeditated and whether defendant should have been sentenced to life imprisonment or death. However, in defendant's own trial testimony, which mirrored counsel's strategy of conceding guilt to felony murder but contesting a finding of premeditation, defendant himself admitted at trial that he was guilty of felony murder, but he argued that the killing was not done with premeditation.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner served two sentences, but after he began serving his sentence for violation of probation of the third sentence, respondent, the Florida Department of Corrections, declared a forfeiture of previously unforfeited gain time from the served sentences and applied them to the sentences imposed upon revocation of probation. The certified question was whether the forfeiture penalty authorized by the court's interpretation of Fla. Stat. ch. 944.28(1) in Eldridge also applied to the type of sentence imposed in Tripp. The court held that because petitioner was eligible to receive Tripp credit from another offense, the statutory forfeiture penalty contained in ch. 944.28(1) likewise authorized the DOC to forfeit gain time from the completed sentences and add that gain time to the revocation of probation sentence. However, in order to comply with the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy, the penalty from the expired sentence could not exceed the credit for time actually served from that same sentence.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) and the child's guardian ad litem, sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's parental rights to her first six children had been terminated due to her neglect and substance abuse. Her rights to the seventh child were terminated after the trial court found that the grounds for termination set forth in ch. 39.806(1)(c) and (i) had been met and that the mother showed a continued unwillingness and inability to parent the child. The district court of appeal reversed, holding that ch. 39.806(1)(i) was facially unconstitutional since it impermissibly shifted the burden to the parent to show that her past conduct did not predict that a current child was at risk. The supreme court held that to terminate parental rights under ch. 39.806(1)(i), the DCF had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the parent's rights to a prior child were terminated involuntarily, that the current child was at substantial risk of significant harm, and that termination was the least restrictive means of protecting the child from harm. Interpreted in this light, ch. 39.806(1)(i) was constitutional. However, the trial court impermissibly placed the burden on the mother to present evidence that her prior conduct was not a predictor of her conduct with the child at issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court of appeal was reversed and the case was remanded for the trial court to apply the constitutional interpretation of the termination statute to the facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an inmate under sentence of death, appealed an order of the Circuit Court in and for Broward County (Florida), that denied his motion for postconviction relief under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, among other things, that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because his lawyer failed to investigate, prepare, and present evidence that would have supported the existence of two statutory mitigating circumstances and several nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. The penalty-phase transcript and the evidentiary-hearing testimony revealed that petitioner's counsel put little time or effort into preparing expressly for the penalty phase. The only witnesses counsel presented at the penalty phase were four members of defendant's family. One of these witnesses, a sister, was not even contacted by counsel. However, petitioner failed to show a reasonable probability that absent counsel's errors, he would not have been sentenced to death. Specifically, the trial court's decision to give the State's expert's testimony greater weight than the testimony of defendant's new experts was supported by competent, substantial evidence because she evaluated petitioner much closer to the time of the murder than the new experts did. At the time of her testimony, the expert was also aware of petitioner's history of alcohol and drug abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the Circuit Court in and for Okaloosa County (Florida) which convicted him of four counts of first-degree murder with a firearm and imposed three sentences of death after the murder of his live-in-girlfriend and her three children. The State cross-appealed and contended that aggravated child abuse should have been considered separately from the under-the-age-of-12 aggravator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence established that defendant and his girlfriend had argued on the night of the murder and that defendant called 911 and stated that he had shot his family. Affirming the convictions and sentences, the court held, inter alia, that (1) although the girlfriend's statement to a friend that she and defendant were fighting that night should not have been admitted under the excited utterance or spontaneous statement exceptions to the hearsay rule, Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(2) and because there was no evidence that the girlfriend did not engage in reflective thought, the error was harmless in light of the other, overwhelming evidence of guilt; (2) the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction of premeditated first-degree murder based on defendant's use of a pump-action shotgun and the time that passed between the argument and the murders; (3) the heinous, atrocious, or cruel factor finding with respect to one of the children was supported by substantial evidence that the child witnessed the murder of his family and saw defendant point the gun at him; and (4) defendant's sentence of death was proportional to sentences in other murder cases involving multiple child-victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences, and it denied the State's cross appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand with instructions from the U.S. Supreme Court, the court considered whether, in light of recent case law on what constituted a &quot;dangerous weapon,&quot; defendant was convicted without proof of one of the elements of the offense of armed burglary under Fla. Stat. ch. 810.02(2)(b) (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1986, defendant burglarized a closed, unoccupied restaurant. When he was arrested, he had in his pocket a folding knife with a blade shorter than four inches. Defendant was charged with armed burglary, which required the State to prove that he was armed with a &quot;dangerous weapon.&quot; The State described the blade as thick and capable of being locked in an open position, unlike a common pocketknife. The jury concluded that defendant's knife was a dangerous weapon, not a common pocketknife, and convicted him of armed burglary. Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. In a 1997 decision, the court held that a defendant's knife with a three and three-quarter inch blade fell within the common pocketknife exception to the Fla. Stat. ch. 790.001(13) definition of a weapon. Defendant unsuccessfully sought retroactive application of the 1997 decision. The U.S. Supreme Court remanded for reconsideration as to whether defendant's due process rights were violated. The court reaffirmed its decision, finding that defendant was properly convicted of armed robbery as the law stood in 1989, because at the time, whether a subject weapon was dangerous was an issue for a jury to determine.</SPAN></P>

The court also denied defendant's petition for habeas relief and held that appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the trial court's denial of the public defender's motion to withdraw; that Florida's capital sentencing scheme did not violate the United States and Florida Constitutions; and that because no death warrant for defendant had been signed, his Eight Amendment claim that he was incompetent to be executed was not yet ripe for review under Fla.

As to the writ for habeas relief, the court found that (1) the capital sentencing scheme was not unconstitutional; (2) defendant failed to show prejudice or error by appellate counsel; and (3) the supreme court did conduct a proportionality review of defendant's death sentence, and a proportionality finding was supported.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for first-degree felony murder, attempted second-degree murder with a firearm, robbery with a firearm, and arson. His death sentence was affirmed on appeal. Denial of defendant's motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 was also affirmed on appeal. Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing Florida's death penalty statute was unconstitutional and appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise issues regarding trial counsel's ineffectiveness, among other issues, on direct appeal. The court found that the constitutional challenge was previously addressed and rejected. Moreover, defendant's aggravating factor of having been convicted of a prior violent felony satisfied the mandates of the United States Constitution. Imposition of the death penalty was constitutional. Appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise a claim of ineffectiveness of trial counsel on direct appeal because such a claim was more effectively raised in a motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. Finally, defendant's remaining claims were either procedurally barred or lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

Affirming, the court held that (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting autopsy photographs because they were relevant and not so inflammatory as to create undue prejudice; (2) substantial evidence supported the trial court's rejection of several mitigating circumstances because, even though there was testimony that defendant exhibited the mitigating qualities, it was not substantiated either by defendant's actions or by the testimony of those who had firsthand knowledge; (3) it was not an abuse of discretion to give little weight to the mitigating factors relating to defendant's abusive childhood; (4) the trial court's finding that the crime was heinous, atrocious, and cruel was supported by the evidence; (5) the death penalty was proportionate based on evidence that the victim was brutally beaten and remained conscious for at least part of the attack; and (6) Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141 was constitutional facially and as applied because Arizona v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the denial of a motion for postconviction relief by the Circuit Court in and for Jefferson County (Florida). Defendant asserted his trial counsel was ineffective in declining to present a defense of intervening cause in the guilt phase and as nonstatutory mitigation in the penalty phase. Defendant also asserted that his sentence of death was unconstitutional. The convictions and death sentence had previously been affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wanted to kill a witness. He placed a bomb in a microwave oven and paid a driver to deliver the microwave to the witness. The driver thought the microwave contained drugs. Defendant rented a car for the driver to use. The driver, who had no license, was stopped for speeding. A dispatcher contacted defendant by phone to determine whether the rental car had been stolen and to tell him that it would be impounded. Defendant gave no warning regarding the bomb. A trooper was subsequently killed when he opened the microwave. Defendant's attorney rejected an &quot;intervening cause&quot; argument, despite his belief that the trooper violated policy in opening the package, as he thought such argument would have resulted in a certain death recommendation. The appellate court held that death was a clearly foreseeable result of defendant's act. Thus, the alleged policy violation would not have negated any of the elements of first-degree murder. The low probability of success, combined with the potential for alienating the jury by blaming the trooper for his own death, justified trial counsel's strategic decision. Constitutional challenges to Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141 had previously been rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two actions, defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court in and for Orange County (Florida) that denied his motion for post conviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851. Defendant also petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. Defendant's appeal, as well as his habeas petition, centered primarily on defendant's claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder for the 1992 murder of a 12-year-old. Several of defendant's claims, including his objection to the prosecution's use of a heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator, were procedurally barred because the arguments were addressed on direct appeal. Further, defendant's constitutional challenges to Fla. R. Bar 4-3.5(d)(4) had been previously addressed and dismissed by the Florida Supreme Court. Defendant also contended that Florida's death penalty unconstitutionally permitted cruel and unusual punishment, and that he was insane and could not be executed. Again, the court had previously rejected similar claims regarding the constitutionality of Florida's death penalty. Finally, defendant asserted that trial counsel's failure to object to his being shackled constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. There was testimony at the evidentiary hearing from witnesses that defendant was not shackled. These witnesses included the head bailiff and the court reporter, who were present throughout the trial and were in a position to observe if defendant was indeed shackled during trial.</SPAN></P>

A psychiatrist evaluated defendant at the time of the trial to determine whether he was competent to stand trial and as to his mental condition at the time of the crimes. He stated that he was not given sufficient information to determine whether defendant was sane at the time he committed the crimes, but there was no indication that he had brain damage. Further, the postconviction court's findings indicated that defense counsel's strategy to prevent the State from introducing damaging evidence of defendant's motive for shooting the victims was reasonable. Finally, the jury heard testimony that defendant had been upset in the days leading up to the shootings and that defendant had never been a violent person, indicating defense counsel's efforts to put on a reasonable defense.</SPAN></P>

The state's highest court held that the trial court did not err when it denied defendant's motion to suppress his statements as his right to remain silent was scrupulously honored. Not only did four of the five factors weigh in favor of admissibility, but also, when defendant initially invoked his right to silence, he said only that he did not want to make a statement &quot;at this time,&quot; leaving open the prospect of future questioning on the crime. Further, the totality of the circumstances demonstrated that defendant voluntarily waived his rights and was fully aware of the consequences of his decision. Also, there was no showing that the delay in defendant's initial appearance induced the confession. Additionally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's motion in limine, as the language used did not imply a mandatory death sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.21(4)(c) (1998), defendant was a &quot;sexual predator&quot; because he had been convicted of kidnapping a minor that was not his child, even though there had been no sexual component to the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his companion stole a car; there was a baby in a car seat in the back seat. They later abandoned the car, with the baby still inside. Because defendant was convicted not only of carjacking, but of kidnapping a child that was not his, under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.21(4)(c) (1998), the trial court had no choice but to find him a sexual predator, even though the State conceded that there was no sexual conduct involving the child. The district court of appeal held that the Act was overinclusive as applied to defendant and did not pass the rational relationship test. The supreme court affirmed, but for different reasons. Because of the stigma attached to sexual predator status, the life-long registration requirements, and the attendant adverse employment affects, the designation as a sexual predator was a deprivation of a protected liberty interest, triggering a substantive due process analysis. The supreme court held that as the predicate crimes had no sexual element and there was no sexual motive for them, the designation of defendant as a sexual predator based solely on his conviction for kidnapping a minor who was not his child violated his right to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates were each convicted of assorted crimes and each sought a writ of habeas corpus, based on issues regarding improper qualification or swearing in of prospective jurors, improper entry of a guilty plea, and a conflict of interest with trial counsel. The court indicated that the instant petitions were representative of many that were filed in the court, and that in the future, it would not continue to either transfer the petitions to lower courts for consideration as motions for postconviction relief or deny them on the merits or due to a procedural bar. Rather, the court concluded that the proper procedural maneuver would be to dismiss such petitions as unauthorized. In a thorough review of the history of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, the court noted the balance between the constitutional right to seek a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, and the institutional needs of the Florida courts system. Rather than continue to encourage misfiled applications to the court which were properly to be made under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 to the sentencing court, the court determined to dismiss unauthorized petitions.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 943.0435(4) and 944.607(9). The State subsequently appealed the judgment of the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) that reversed and remanded the trial court's decision, holding that the State was required to prove defendant's knowledge of the registration provisions of the statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant had served both his incarceration and parole time following a conviction for indecent assault, defendant moved, and was subsequently arrested when a police officer discovered defendant had not registered as a sex offender. Defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges, claiming he was not aware of the registration requirements, and he subsequently challenged the constitutionality of the sexual offender registration statutes based on the absence of a knowledge requirement. The trial court denied defendant's pretrial constitutional challenge. At trial the State asked for, and the trial court gave, a jury instruction explaining that the State was not required to prove that the statute had an element of knowledge or that defendant intended to violate the statute. In evaluating the language of the statutes, there was no such indication of legislative intent to dispense with mens rea. The public welfare offense rationale offered by the State did not apply to the sexual offender registration statutes. As such, due process required that the State demonstrate that defendant had knowledge of the requirements to register under the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and a new trial was ordered to be conducted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two consolidated cases, the first in the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) and the other in the Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida), presented two questions concerning a jury instruction in prosecutions for driving or boating under the influence. The first issue was whether giving the standard jury instruction on the presumption of impairment was fundamental error and second, if preserved, whether the error was harmful per se.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One lower court of appeal concluded that giving the standard instruction on the presumption of impairment contrary to Miles was not fundamental error that could be raised initially on appeal. The other lower court of appeal determined that it was harmful error per se. The first case involved boating under the influence. The second case involved driving under the influence. In the first case, the trial court gave the standard jury instruction that provided two alternative methods in which to prove the crimes charged. It also gave the standard jury instruction on the presumptions of impairment contained in the implied consent law. The second court also instructed the jury on the presumption of impairment. The juries in both cases utilized a general verdict form in finding defendants guilty. The supreme court held that the improper instruction did not constitute fundamental error when the jury was instructed on either driving with an unlawful blood- or breath-alcohol level (DUBAL) or actual impairment, or both. Where the evidence of actual impairment was strong, the jury could choose to rely in part or whole on the presumption of impairment instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conclusion that giving a standard instruction on the presumption of impairment was not fundamental error was approved. The holding that such an error was harmless solely because of overwhelming evidence of actual impairment was not approved. Thus, the decision in the second case was quashed and the matter was remanded for affirmance of defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner tree owners challenged the decision of the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida), which reversed a trial court's decision and expressly declared the Citrus Canker Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 581.184 (2003) constitutional under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and Fla.

Affirming, the court held that: (1) the appellate court properly applied the reasonable relationship test because the state paid compensation for trees that were destroyed; (2) under the reasonable relationship test, the trial court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the legislature, which determined that the 1,900-feet eradication zone was justified by the best available science, and the Citrus Canker Law did not violate the owners' rights to substantive due process; (3) the lack of a pre-deprivation hearing did not deny the owners a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the propriety of the Department's removal order because summary eradication of the disease was warranted; and (4) pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 933, it was within the magistrate's discretion to decide both whether to issue a single warrant to search multiple properties based on a single application, and whether to use an electronic signature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the appellate court's decision, which declared the Citrus Canker Law constitutional and quashed the trial court's orders placing restrictions on the Department's ability to obtain search warrants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner newspaper sought access to certain public, but confidential, records maintained by respondent, the Department of Children and Families (DCF), pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 119.07(7)(a) (2002). Upon direct conflict with two cases from the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida), this matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue before the instant court was whether: (1) DCF waived its objection to personal jurisdiction when it simultaneously moved to transfer venue; (2) the newspaper was required to serve DCF with the petition; and (3) the circuit court erred in refusing to apply the home venue privilege. The district court held that DCF waived its objection by seeking a transfer of venue. The court also held that the circuit court did not err in refusing to apply the home venue privilege, even though none of the recognized exceptions to the privilege were satisfied. The instant court first held that a motion to transfer venue, filed simultaneously with an objection to personal jurisdiction, did not waive the jurisdictional objection. Second, Fla. Stat. ch. 119.07(7)(a) required formal service of process on DCF. Thus, the circuit court erred in denying DCF's motion to dismiss the petition for insufficient service of process and lack of personal jurisdiction. Finally, a fourth exception to the home venue privilege was created similar to the joint tortfeasor exception. Because the case fell within this new exception, the circuit court did not err in refusing to apply the home venue privilege.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment regarding the waiver of jurisdiction was disapproved. The judgment of the circuit court denying DCF's motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process and lack of personal jurisdiction was erroneous. Finally, the circuit court's judgment regarding the home venue privilege was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction, death sentence, and the denial of his first postconviction motion for relief were previously affirmed on appeal. The denial of his state and federal petitions for habeas corpus relief were also affirmed on appeal. After the death warrant was signed, he filed a successor motion under Rule 3.851, as well as a motion to release evidence for DNA testing, both of which were denied. Defendant appealed and the court found that a codefendant's recantation testimony lacked credibility. The trial court had carefully considered the codefendant's diminished capacity while making its determination. Further, there was no finding of a Brady or Giglio violation by the State, which was also procedurally barred. Defendant failed to show &quot;exceptionally clear proof&quot; of racial discrimination during the prosecution and sentencing in his case. The denial of notes in the investigating officers' personnel files was proper, as defendant did not show that such would have been admissible for anything except propensity. DNA testing was not shown to have any value towards exonerating defendant or reducing his sentence, and his habeas claims had been previously raised and lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and others robbed a store, and kidnapped and fatally shot the store clerk. Defendant was convicted as the shooter and he was sentenced to death. Thereafter, he was granted a new penalty phase due to the discovery of withheld Brady materials by the State. The jury imposed the death sentence, finding five aggravators and only one statutory mitigator, in that defendant was only 19 years old at the time of the crime. There were also 13 nonstatutory mitigating factors which were given minimal weight. Defendant appealed and the court found that suppression of defendant's statement was properly denied, as he initiated the police interrogation and his waiver of rights was knowingly and intelligently made. The law of the case did not apply, and res judicata did not bar the consideration of the admissibility of the statement. Exclusion of certain defense evidence was proper based on issues of cumulative evidence, inability to rebut unavailable witnesses' statements, and relevance. A misstatement during closing argument was harmless, and denial of mistrial was proper. Competent, substantial evidence supported the finding of the aggravators, and the sentence was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was declared to be the natural father in a paternity action. A provision was included regarding income tax exemptions. The mother filed a timely motion for rehearing in the paternity action pertaining to the taxes. However, she was killed in a car accident. The grandmother sought to intervene in the paternity action that was pending on rehearing and requested visitation rights pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 61.13(2)(b)2.c. The supreme court held the paternity judgment was not voided by the death of the mother. Thus, the cause of action was not moot and the trial court retained jurisdiction to consider the economic matters. The mother challenged only a collateral economic issue and did not challenge any substantive issue. However, the grandmother's issue of visitation was no longer the matter in litigation and her motion to intervene was properly denied. Fla. Stat. ch. 61.13(2)(b)2.c failed to require a showing of harm to the affected child, did not further a compelling state interest, and was facially unconstitutional as violative of a parent's fundamental right of privacy under Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparent visitation statute was declared unconstitutional. The judgment of the lower appellate court, which affirmed the trial court, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate challenged the judgment entered and sought further relief. However, the instant court held that the post-conviction court's resolution of the Giglio claim failed to consider whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the false evidence regarding the payment could have affected that court's judgment. Nor did that court find that the State had demonstrated that the false evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, the inmate was not entitled to relief on his Brady claim, as he failed to show that the State deprived him of evidence which it believed to be exculpatory. Likewise, there was no merit to the claim that the State committed a Brady violation by failing to disclose that the hair evidence had been destroyed. Further, the inmate failed to show that such was favorable to him. Because the inmate's counsel reasonably discounted the evidentiary value of the hair sample, he was not constitutionally ineffective. Third, the inmate's claims of misconduct were procedurally barred as they could have and should have been raised on direct appeal. Finally, the inmate failed to show he was entitled to habeas relief, and that his claims were ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court of Florida had affirmed the conviction and death sentence. The inmate appealed a trial court order denying postconviction relief and petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the penalty phase, the inmate's trial counsel presented the testimony of 15 witnesses in mitigation. The supreme court determined that the inmate's untaped confession while in his holding cell should have been suppressed. However, the error was harmless as the inmate subsequently gave a taped statement after being Mirandized. The supreme court rejected the other issues raised by the inmate as without merit and affirmed the conviction and death sentence. The inmate's counsel did not request a specific instruction on voluntary intoxication for four specific reasons, including the fact that the inmate gave two very detailed confessions of the crime which undermined an argument that the inmate was seriously impaired. Even if counsel's performance was deficient, there was a general verdict and the evidence supported an instruction on felony murder based on sexual battery, which was a general intent crime to which voluntary intoxication was not a defense. The inmate's other assertions of ineffective trial counsel were without merit. Finally, the inmate's assertions of ineffective appellate counsel were also without merit, largely because alleged trial errors were not errors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant's issues questioned whether: (1) his lawyers in the penalty phase provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to certain closing arguments; (2) his lawyers were ineffective for failing to move to suppress evidence; (3) his guilty pleas were voluntary; and (4) his death sentence was unconstitutional. The appeals court answered each in the negative. First, the trial court properly found that both of defendant's trial counsel were extremely experienced and utilized a defense strategy to forego any objection. Second, the search of defendant's home was justified under the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. Thus, suppression would have been denied. Third, defendant fully understood both the plea agreement and his discussions with counsel about the admissibility of contested photographs. Finally, the instant court had previously rejected post-conviction challenges to Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141. Additionally, the prior violent felony or capital felony conviction aggravator exempted this case from the requirement of jury findings on any fact necessary to render a defendant eligible for the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgments entered, first contending that he was entitled to suppression of his statements made following his arrest on an unrelated charge. The appeals court disagreed. Although he was in custody on said charge at the time he invoked his rights, he was not being interrogated, and no interrogation was imminent on the murder case. Thus, his invocation of rights only precluded the police from questioning him about the unrelated charge, not the murders. Second, defendant's claim relating to the dismissal of a potential juror was dispositive. The juror's response that she could put her personal feelings aside and be fair in the guilt and penalty phases even though she opposed the death penalty, satisfied the juror competency standard. Moreover, such error was not subject to harmless error analysis. Third, the aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed in the course of a felony aggravator was constitutional. Finally, if the sentences imposed for defendant's non-capital offenses could not have been lawfully imposed under the 1994 sentencing guidelines, then resentencing in accordance with those guidelines without departure was in order.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced him to death for the murder conviction and to life imprisonment for the other convictions. He appealed the postconviction court's denial of his Fla. R. Crim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate and an accomplice killed a police officer and wounded another police officer in a shooting during an armed robbery. The inmate made various allegations of error in his motion for postconviction relief and his petition for habeas corpus relief. The supreme court found that as to his postconviction relief claims (1) there was no merit to his guilt-phase claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel; (2) he failed to satisfy the Brady test, as he did not show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different had he been in possession of a witness's statements; and (3) the postconviction court correctly found that his claim that he was rendered effectively absent during a critical stage of the proceedings was procedurally barred. However, a resentencing was necessary on the basis of the invalidation of his prior felony conviction that was introduced at his penalty phase. As to his habeas petition, the supreme court found that he failed to show ineffective assistance of appellate counsel or that he was prejudiced by the absence of a part of the record on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of postconviction relief was affirmed in part as to the issues relating solely to the guilt phase of the inmate's trial; however, the death sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing before a new jury on the first-degree murder conviction. The petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>
