(2010), video voyeurism, or &sect; 810.14, Fla. Stat., voyeurism, would prohibit a substantial amount of protected speech in relation to their otherwise legitimate applications. Thus, because any applications of sections 810.145 and 810.14 which violate the First Amendment could be remedied through as-applied litigation, overbreadth was not used to invalidate the statutes; [2]-The trial court erred by denying defendant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800 motion to correct sentencing error because it did not orally pronounce that &quot;sex offender conditions apply&quot; to defendant's community control and probation terms. Instead, the trial court orally pronounced which special conditions it was imposing upon those terms, and only those orally pronounced special conditions could have been placed in the orders of community control and probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">ISSUE: Whether the Florida Department of Financial Services properly denied a firefighter's application for certification as a fire safety inspector. HOLDINGS: [1]-Under the plain language of &sect;&sect; 633.216(2) and 633.412(1)(b), Fla. Stat. (2013), one of the requirements for becoming a fire safety inspector was that the applicant had not entered a plea of nolo contendere to a felony. Because the firefighter pleaded nolo contendere to a felony, the plain language of these statutes precluded him from obtaining a certification as a fire safety inspector as a matter of law; [2]-Section 112.011, Fla. Stat. (2013), was inapplicable as it pertained to an initial hiring rather than a certification; [3]-The fact that the firefighter was previously certified as a firefighter under an earlier statutory scheme was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

Stat., it was enforceable in Florida pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause and &sect; 61.526, Fla. Stat., regardless of the mother's argument that the order violated Florida public policy; [2]-In denying the mother's petition for modification, the trial court did not err in determining that there had not been a substantial and material change in circumstances during the 13 days between the entry of the Colorado order and the filing of the mother's petition; [3]-As it was not clear whether the trial court, in summarily denying the grandparents' request for attorney's fees under &sect; 61.535(1), Fla. Stat., had considered whether assessing such fees would be clearly inappropriate, it was to make specific findings as to this issue on remand.</SPAN></P>

Her neglect resulted in the dog's condition visibly deteriorating to the point that he was severely debilitated and in serious pain and so malnourished that his hips and ribs were protruding, his eyes and ears were observably infected, and he had heartworms, skin mites, and hookworms, several tumors, and, ultimately, had to be euthanized due to his condition; [2]-The 2013 amendment did not change the law but rather clarified the legislature's intent and the existing state of the law that failure to act can be the basis for a felony cruelty-to-animals conviction.</SPAN></P>

(2009) (possession of a firearm by a convicted felon) and &sect; 790.01, Fla. Stat. (2009) (carrying a concealed firearm) were rendered unconstitutionally vague by failing to say whether a certain antique firearm was included because defendant possessed a modern firearm; [2]-Defendant was not entitled to immunity under the stand your ground law, &sect; 776.013(3), Fla. Stat. (2009), because he was engaged in the unlawful activity of being a felon in possession of a firearm; [3]-A conviction for aggravated battery should not have been reclassified to a first-degree felony under &sect; 775.087(1), Fla. Stat. (2009) because the jury was instructed that it could return a verdict for aggravated battery by either great bodily harm or use of a deadly weapon and the verdict form did not reflect which theory was the basis for the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Stat., the exemption to the Sunshine Law for meetings between a public body and its attorney was limited to discussions involving the actual settlement of presently pending litigation, in violation of that limitation, the discussions in the seven closed meetings at issue covered a wide range of political and policy issues not connected to settlement of the pending litigation or related to the expenses of litigating the pending cases, which at that point were on appeal; [2]-St. Pete Beach, Florida, Ordinance 2011-19 (June 28, 2011), was void because the City did not comply with the notice requirements of &sect; 166.041 when it passed the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

(2013); the court certified that the case required immediate resolution by the Florida Supreme Court because the issues pending were of great public importance and would have a great effect on the proper administration of justice in the state; [2]-The issue presented was not solely an analysis of whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution required recognizing the parties' out-of-state marriage for the purposes of dissolution, but was whether Florida's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutionally limited various constitutional guaranties, including full faith and credit, access to courts, equal protection, and the right to travel.</SPAN></P>

State, and as the issue was being by the Florida Supreme Court, the instant court's mandate for reversal of the orders denying the movants' PCR motions would be stayed; [3]-Retroactive application of Miller was appropriate because the Supreme Court had already given its decision retroactive effect, the second strand of precedent applied in Miller had been applied retroactively, and applying the adminstration of justice would not be substantially impacted.</SPAN></P>

Defendant called the child's mother when he realized she was in distress, and the mother returned home to evaluate the child and called 911. Further, the State failed to provide evidence that defendant's choice to call the mother rather than 911 was gross and flagrant negligence that was committed with an utter disregard for the safety of others such that he must have known, or reasonably should have known, was likely to cause death or great bodily harm, as required to prove culpable negligence.</SPAN></P>

(2011), did not violate equal protection or due process by providing that, in the case of a jointly owned vehicle, the traffic citation must be mailed only to the person whose name appeared first on the registration. There was a rational basis for distinguishing between the first named owner of the vehicle and subsequent named owners. The classification issue involved neither a &quot;fundamental right&quot; nor a &quot;suspect&quot; classification.

As applied to juveniles, &sect;&sect; 775.082(3)(b) and 812.13(2)(a), Fla. Stat., violated U.S. Const. amend.

Stat. (2008), once the JCC agreed that there was a disagreement sufficient to require the appointment of an EMA, the JCC had a mandatory obligation to direct, on his own motion, that the employee be evaluated with the carrier paying for the evaluation; [3]-On remand, the JCC, on its own motion, was to order that the claimant be evaluated by the EMA and direct the carrier to pay for the evaluation.</SPAN></P>

Stat., without considering that it was subject to waiver upon &quot;good cause shown&quot;; [2]-Moreover, denial of continuance was also error because it was unclear whether the Judge applied the appropriate rule of law, as there were no findings regarding whether the inability to obtain new representation arose from &quot;circumstances beyond the claimant's control.&quot;</SPAN></P>

P. 1.140(b); [2]-Further, venue against the agencies was proper because it was in the location of the agencies' headquarters; [3]-The court declined to address the agencies' interlocutory appeal as a petition for writ of prohibition under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), adjudicated appellant, a child, for carrying a concealed firearm, grand theft of a firearm, under &sect; 812.014(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2011), improper exhibition of a firearm, resisting arrest without violence, and possession of a firearm by a minor, under &sect; 790.22(3), Fla. Stat. (2011). Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of dismissal on the grand theft charge because the state failed to prove that he stole the firearm. The appellate court held that, because the State relied solely on the presumption of possession of recently stolen property to establish the crime, and the property was not recently stolen, appellant's adjudication for grand theft was supported by insufficient evidence. The State failed to prove that appellant was guilty of grand theft based solely on the possession of the gun five months after its theft because guns were highly saleable and were transferred with relative ease. What constituted &quot;recently stolen&quot; sufficient to apply the legislative presumption had to be construed with that transferability in mind. However, sufficient evidence supported the adjudication for carrying a concealed firearm because &sect; 790.22(3), Fla. Stat. (2011), restricting the right of minors to carry firearms, was not unconstitutional. The state placed appropriate restrictions on a juvenile's possession of firearms, which were permissible under the Second Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The adjudication for grand theft was reversed and the trial court was directed to dismiss that charge. The remaining adjudications were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Circuit Court for Lee County (Florida) denied his motion to dismiss, defendant pleaded no contest to using electronic communication to further the interest of a criminal gang in violation of &sect; 874.11, Fla. Stat. (2008). He appealed, arguing that the statute was facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Court of Appeal of Florida for the First District had found that the statute violated U.S. Const. amend. I and the Due Process Clause. The court agreed that the portion of &sect; 874.11 related to the using of electronic communications to benefit or promote a gang by advertising oneself in the community was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. While nothing about the advertising prong tied the electronic communication to a criminal activity, however, the prong that criminalized &quot;benefiting, promoting, or furthering the interests of a criminal gang. to intimidate or harass other persons&quot; prohibited identifiable criminal conduct on its face. Because the two prongs were independent, when the overbroad &quot;advertising&quot; prong was removed, a statute that was narrowly tailored to prevent the furtherance of the interests of a gang by using electronic communications to intimidate or harass others remained. The same severability argument applied to the First District's determination that &sect; 874.11 violated due process by criminalizing innocent conduct. Thus, on remand the trial court was to reconsider the motion to dismiss in relation to the remaining portion of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the matter to the trial court to reconsider defendant's motion to dismiss in relation to the portion of the statute that had not been held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, landlord and management company, appealed an order by the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) that dismissed the landlord's third-party claims for common law indemnity and for breach of contract against appellee tenant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 2008, appellee tenant's employee allegedly stepped on an uneven concrete floor in the backroom of the tenant's store, fell, and injured his knee. As a result, the tenant provided workers' compensation benefits to the employee. Thereafter, the employee and appellee wife (jointly the employee) filed a three-count amended complaint against the landlord and the management company for negligently maintaining the property. The appellate court found, inter alia, that the landlord did not properly plead a claim for common law indemnity because he failed to show the existence of any special relationship between himself and the tenant that would make him vicariously, constructively, derivatively, or technically liable to the employee because of the tenant's negligence or fault. Since the landlord's claim for common law indemnification failed to state a cause of action, the related claim for breach of contract could not be maintained as a third-party claim. However, since the plain language of the lease did not unambiguously establish that the tenant did not breach its duty, the trial court erred in dismissing the third-party claim for breach of contract with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order was affirmed as to the dismissal with prejudice of the claim for common law indemnification and the claim for breach of contract; the order was reversed as to the dismissal of the breach of contract claim to the extent that such dismissal was with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that portions of the victim's boyfriend's testimony should have been excluded as hearsay and that the recordings should have been suppressed. The appellate court affirmed, but certified a question of great public importance to the supreme court. Even if statements made by the victim's boyfriend were admitted in error, the error was harmless. The boyfriend merely repeated the victim's statement without going into any detail, and evidence was presented that the victim had shared the same information with various other people. Additionally, U.S. Const. amend. IV was not implicated because the recordings were made by a private individual as opposed to a government actor. And, suppressing the recordings at issue would have produced an absurd result, unintended by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court wrongfully denied his motion to suppress evidence of the cocaine because the cocaine was seized as the result of an unlawful detention and/or warrantless exploratory search. The appellate court noted that a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave or terminate the encounter, and it was an investigatory stop. The information provided in the anonymous call was bare bones and lacked any degree of detail. The information was not even corroborated by the officer's investigation. The only way that the investigative stop could be justified was if the officer independently witnessed activity giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that a crime was being committed. The officer had no basis for suspecting that defendant and the other man with him were committing the crime of trespass other than their mere presence at the apartment complex with posted &quot;no trespass&quot; signs. This was legally insufficient to justify the officer's investigatory stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court noted that the contract at issue was comprehensive, as opposed to discrete, health services did not remove the Department's authority for it. The challenged contract identified line item 784 as the specific appropriation for its funding. The line item appropriated approximately $134 million for &quot;Inmate Health Services.&quot; The Department was allocated more than $92 million in otherwise non-restricted funds for the provision of inmate health services. By designating that appropriation as its funding source, the contract satisfied &sect; 216.313, Fla. Stat.'s requirement to disclose the specific appropriation from which payment would be made. The Joint Legislative Budget Commission (LBC), acting on behalf of the legislative branch, agreed that the budget adjustment was consistent with legislative policy and intent. There was evidence not only that the Department was authorized to privatize inmate health services, but that the Legislature intended for such privatization to occur. The LBC's decision to approve the amendment was well-grounded, and complied with &sect; 216.181, Fla. Stat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a workers' compensation benefits claimant, sought review of orders of the Judge of Compensation Claims (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee employer/carrier's (E/C) motion to tax costs against him under &sect; 440.34(3), Fla. Stat. (2007), and denied his motion to approve a retainer agreement between him and an attorney. He challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 440.34 and &sect; 440.105(3)(c), Fla. Stat.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal held that &sect;&sect; 440.34 and 440.105(3)(c) were unconstitutional. To the extent that &sect;&sect; 440.34 and 440.105(3)(c) prohibited claimant from retaining counsel to defend a motion to tax costs against him, those statutes infringed upon claimant's constitutional rights under the First Amendment of the Constitution. The statutes did not survive strict scrutiny. It was not evident from case law that the fee regulations represented a general interest in regulating attorney's fees. It was claimant, not the E/C, who would pay the fee implicated by the legal work at issue. Premiums charged by insurers would be unaffected. There could be no depletion of benefits where there were no benefits. A successful defense against an E/C's motion to tax costs did not constitute &quot;benefits secured.&quot; Sections 440.105(3)(c) and 440.34 did not constitute reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions on claimant's First Amendment rights to free speech, free association, and petition for redress. They were not a permissible exercise of the State's police power to restrict claimant's First Amendment right to contract for legal services to defend against an E/C's motion to tax costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal reversed the orders and remanded the case for a new hearing on the motion to tax costs and motion to approve a retainer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Lafayette County (Florida), which convicted them of possession and manufacture of cannabis and possession of a device used in the manufacturing process. Defendants argued that the trial court erred in denying their suppression motions because the evidence against them was obtained pursuant to two illegal searches of their mobile home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon receiving an anonymous call that defendants had marijuana plants in their mobile home, officers went to defendants' home to investigate. When no one answered after they knocked on the door, the officers looked in a window that was two feet to the left of the front door and saw marijuana plants inside. The court held that the officers' intrusion into the curtilage of the mobile home, on a part of the property on which they had no legal right to be, and peering through a window a hand's length away at a sharp angle into an otherwise private part of the home, constituted a search in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV under both the expectation of privacy test and the intrusion test. Either way, this entry into the protected private space of the home was an improper attempt to verify an anonymous tip. The State's evidence lacked any indicia that the privacy of the mobile home's kitchen area had been diminished by its occupants. No evidence was presented that the area where the plants were located could be seen from the public roadway, from the pathway leading to the front door, or from the front door itself.</SPAN></P>

The applicants and the division argued that &sect; 550.054(14)(a), (b), should have been construed together, and together formed the relevant classification. However, the appellate court found that nothing in the statute indicated that a jai-alai permitholder was barred from converting the permit under &sect; 550.054(14)(a) without taking advantage of the remainder of &sect; 550.054(14). &quot;Only two&quot; in &sect; 550.054(14)(a) meant two and not one, three, or more. The division argued that &quot;only&quot; meant &quot;no more than,&quot; but this was at odds with the statute's language and was not entitled to deference. The Act set forth, on its face, very specific limiting criteria for conversion of jai-alai permits into greyhound permits. The law was so specific that the legislature essentially described three specific counties as the ones where jai-alai permits may have been converted. Appellants showed that the law was special. This highly contrived scenario was insufficient to justify a conclusion that the class established by &sect; 550.054(14)(a) was open.</SPAN></P>

The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for entry of summary judgment for appellants on their request for a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. Otherwise, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

App. P. 9.160, appellant city challenged the order of the County Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), which held that a city ordinance criminalizing loitering with intent to commit prostitution was facially unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee had moved to dismiss the charge claiming that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional. The county court granted appellee's motion to dismiss. The court compared the city's ordinance to two cases from the Florida Supreme Court. The court held that structurally similar to another ordinance that was struck down, the city's ordinance allowed for arbitrary enforcement by law enforcement. The additional language that the violator's conduct must be activity which demonstrates a specific intent did not vitiate the fact that much is left to individual officer's discretion. The individual officer would still determine subjectively if waving at passersby or strolling down the street demonstrated the specific intent to violate the ordinance. The court held such language was too broad and vague. As such, the court agreed with the trial court's assessment that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

By March of 2012, appellee still had not been arraigned on the charge and the State still had not served appellee and his parents/guardian with a summons. Relying upon &sect; 985.0301(6), Fla. Stat.

However, the appellate court found that &sect; 985.0301(6) was fairly viewed as authorizing the trial court to elect to end its jurisdiction over a child at any time following the initial adjudicatory hearing-not as permitting the trial court to use its discretion to terminate jurisdiction to put an end to the prosecution before the case ever reached adjudication on the merits. Further, the separation of powers doctrine provided that one branch of government may not encroach upon the powers of another. And, it was the state attorney, not the trial courts, who had complete discretion in making the decision to charge and prosecute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated appeal, the State appealed two suppression orders entered by the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County, Florida--one involving a warrantless search of defendant's home with his consent (case one), and the second involving a search of a different home when he was arrested on 10-day-old charges (case two).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that defendant's consent in case one was voluntary. Defendant's Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, rights were not violated. Defendant was 34 and sufficiently mature to make an intelligent decision. He executed a written consent form that was in English, after being asked whether he wanted it in English or Spanish. He had a prior criminal history and presumably knew his rights. Although he unnecessarily was read the Miranda warnings, that could be more protective of his rights than intimidating. He signed an additional consent form to expand the scope of the search while it was ongoing. There was no overwhelming display of force. No evidence allowed the detective's testimony to be discounted. In case two, the detective crossed the threshold of a home and arrested defendant knowing that an arrest warrant had not been issued. There were no exigent circumstances. The intrusion was not a knock and talk. The detective was a trespasser who entered the property to commit a warrantless arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment and art. I, &sect; 12, Fla. Const. The inevitable discovery doctrine did not apply. The contraband found was fruit of the poisonous tree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The suppression order in case one was reversed. The suppression order in case two was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Manatee County (Florida), which convicted him of numerous offenses, including armed trafficking in illegal drugs and possession of a firearm by a convicted felony. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on the deputy's concern for defendant's safety and the fact that defendant was unresponsive to the deputy's attempts to communicate with him, the court held that no unreasonable search or seizure, in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV, occurred prior to the deputy opening the car door and smelling the odor of marijuana. The deputy was merely conducting a welfare check, and her conduct did not violate constitutional principles. Further, defendant failed to preserve the challenge to the voluntariness of his confession since defendant's counsel specifically told the trial court that there was a stipulation as to the dispositive nature of the search and seizure issue, making no mention of the issue relating to the voluntary nature of the confession. Even if the challenge had been preserved, defendant's confession was voluntary. The detective's statement, to the effect that she would speak for defendant at his sentencing hearing and would do what she could but could not make any promises, was not an unlimited offer to help but merely an offer to make defendant's cooperation known to the circuit court. This did not render defendant's subsequent confession involuntary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition alleged that the claimant was irreparably harmed by the JCC's order because it left him without legal representation to navigate the complex workers' compensation system.

Accordingly, under the circumstances of the case, it was disingenuous for the claimant to suggest that the challenged order left him without legal representation. As the claimant failed to establish that the challenged order in had a material, irreparable adverse impact on his access to competent counsel of his choice, the court lacked jurisdiction to review the challenged order by certiorari.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) convicted defendant of first-degree murder of a 14-year-old victim and attempted first-degree murder of a 13-year-old victim. The trial court sentenced defendant to life without the possibility of parole for first-degree murder and to a consecutive term of thirty years for attempted first-degree murder. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of his crimes, defendant was 14 years old. The appellate court held that his sentence of life without parole violated the Eighth Amendment because it was mandatory. Although a trial court was not barred from imposing a sentence of life without parole, the sentencer was required to take into account how children were different, and had to be free to impose a lesser sentence when the defendant's youth or the circumstances of the crime so indicated. Defendant also argued that the attempted first-degree murder conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence. On the day before he murdered the 14-year-old victim, defendant convinced the 13-year-old victim to follow him into the same bathroom where he later killed the 14-year-old victim. Once inside, defendant tried to get the 13-year-old victim join him in a stall. All of these actions defendant himself identified as steps he planned to take in order to murder both victims, and were the same steps that defendant took the next day when he murdered the 14-year-old victim. These steps went beyond mere planning and preparation. Therefore, sufficient evidence supported the conviction of attempted first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's life sentence was vacated. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed after being convicted following a bench trial in the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County, Florida, on charges of carrying a concealed weapon and possession of marijuana in excess of 20 grams. Defendant asked that &sect;&sect; 893.101 and 893.13, Fla. Stat. (2007), be declared facially unconstitutional and to vacate his conviction and sentence for possession of marijuana in excess of twenty grams.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant also claimed that the trial court committed fundamental error in denying his motion to suppress. The first issue had been resolved by the Florida Supreme Court's Adkins decision after defendant filed his appellate brief. That decision held that &sect;893.101 and &sect; 893.13 did not violate due process and were constitutionally sound. Possession of a controlled substance in Florida was a general intent crime, not a strict liability crime. Thus, defendant's assertion that possession of a controlled substance was a strict liability offense requiring a penalty of less than one-year incarceration also failed. Finally, there was no fundamental error when the trial court, in hearing the motion to suppress and conducting the bench trial concurrently, heard hearsay testimony regarding an untested informant who had given the police information that a drug buy was to go down at a gas station. The trial court did not rely on that information in determining if the stop of defendant's vehicle was legal. Rather, the trial court found that taillight that was completely out on defendant's vehicle provided an appropriate basis for the stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During a traffic stop, a bag containing marijuana was found in a vehicle being driven by defendant. Because it was clear that defendant did not have exclusive possession of the black bag containing marijuana, as there were other persons in the car and she did not admit the bag was hers, the State was required to prove constructive possession with evidence beyond the fact that she was in near proximity to the bag. The appellate court found that, while knowledge of the presence of the marijuana in the bag was proven, there was insufficient evidence of ability to exercise dominion and control. Because defendant had passengers with her, the State was not entitled to an inference of dominion and control. The State was required to produce independent evidence pointing to her dominion and control of the bag, but nothing about the bag tied it to the driver when there was another person in the car. The State did not produce independent evidence of defendant's dominion and control over the contraband. Defendant and her passengers had equal access to bag, but the State did not present evidence tying the bag to her specifically to the exclusion of her reasonable hypothesis of innocence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment and sentence for possession of marijuana was reversed, and the case was remanded with direction that defendant be discharged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) determined that appellant's petition for writ of mandamus challenging his presumptive parole release date (PPRD) was untimely as a result of the application of &sect; 95.11(5)(f), Fla. Stat. (2011). Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant alleged that the statute,&nbsp;&sect; 95.11(5)(f), Fla. Stat. (2011), constituted an unconstitutional infringement on the Florida Supreme Court's rulemaking power pursuant to Art. V, &sect; 2(a), Fla. Const. The appellate court rejected appellant's arguments. Here, the issue did not involve a petition for habeas corpus. The only constitutional challenge to the statute was a separation of powers challenge. Appellant raised no other &quot;constitutional infirmities&quot; in applying Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.630 and &sect; 95.11(5)(f), Fla. Stat. to non-habeas writs. Until the Florida Supreme Court exercised its authority to control the time in which a PPRD writ of mandamus had to be commenced, Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.630 controlled and the time was to be &quot;as provided by law.&quot; Because of the interplay of rule and law, &sect; 95.11(5)(f), Fla. Stat. did not violate the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a motion to correct illegal sentences in two unrelated cases. The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) denied the motion. Defendant appealed, arguing that the life-without-parole sentences imposed upon nonhomicide offenses committed while he was a juvenile violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII under the authority established by the United States Supreme Court in Graham.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1987, defendant, then a juvenile, was convicted of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and armed robbery. In a second case that same year, he pleaded guilty to attempted murder. He was sentenced in both cases on the same day. The court noted that Graham prohibited the imposition of a life without parole sentence on a juvenile nonhomicide offender. There was an exception, however, for juveniles who committed both homicide and nonhomicide offenses. The court stated that the exception to Graham applied only where the juvenile was convicted of committing both a homicide and nonhomicide in the course of the same criminal episode. Accordingly, the life-without-parole sentences in the second case violated Graham. As for the first case, the court rejected defendant's argument that the life-without-parole sentences on the two nonhomicides were unconstitutional because they exceeded the sentence imposed for the homicide. Under the statutory scheme then in effect, the trial court imposed the maximum sentence authorized for first-degree murder. Moreover, the proportionality argument was predicated upon the 1987 sentencing scheme and should have been raised previously.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's order denying relief as to the first case. It reversed the order as to the second case and remanded that case for a new sentencing hearing and for proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees driver of a vehicle involved in a fatal traffic accident, passenger, and others, sued appellant father of the operator of the other vehicle involved in the accident, and others, seeking damages from the accident. A jury in the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) found that the driver and the operator were each fifty percent negligent and awarded damages. The father appealed. The driver and the passenger moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father shared title with the operator to their auto and argued that as a co-owner he was entitled to the damages limit that &sect; 324.021(9)(b)(3), Fla. Stat. provided. The father argued that the word &quot;loan&quot; was ambiguous in the context of co-owners. The appellate court disagreed. The trial court did not err in denying the father the &sect; 324.021(9)(b)(3) cap. The father also wanted to raise the issue of contribution and did so by moving to amend by adding a counterclaim, but the trial court found that this was a not a contribution issue but a Fabre issue, i.e., that the driver was a Fabre defendant. However, Fabre was not strictly applicable to this situation because the driver was not an absent party. A contribution action was necessarily against a party because, pursuant to &sect; 768.31(2)(a), Fla. Stat., contribution was limited to a party who was found to be jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury or wrongful death. The trial court erred in denying the amendment to add a claim for contribution, and, when the contribution issue was ripe posttrial-because the jury found that the driver was 50 percent negligent-a successor judge compounded the error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">That part of the trial court's ruling that &sect; 324.021(9)(b)(3) was not applicable to the father as a co-owner was affirmed and a question of great public importance was certified. That part of the final judgment that awarded the driver one million dollars was reversed and the case was remanded for consideration of the contribution issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant injured worker, a firefighter and paramedic, suffered severe injuries.

The worker also challenged the constitutionality of the current system of redress for workplace injuries found in ch. 440, Fla. Stat.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, the Employer/Carrier (E/C) accepted the injury as compensable and paid him temporary total disability benefits under &sect; 440.15(2)(a), Fla. Stat. While on a total disability status, the worker's entitlement to the 104 weeks of temporary total disability benefits expired, as required by 440.15(2)(a). At that point, however, the worker was incapable of working or obtaining employment. The worker filed a claim for permanent total disability benefits under &sect; 440.15(1), Fla. Stat. Even once he fully recovered, the worker could not, under normal circumstances, recover disability benefits for the indeterminate waiting period. The appellate court held that such a result could not comport with any legal or natural notion of justice. Thus, &sect; 440.15(2)(a), Fla. Stat. (2009), was unconstitutional under Art. I, &sect; 21, Fla. Const., as applied to the worker and others similarly situated, by limiting him to no more than 104 weeks of temporary disability benefits, despite the fact that he was at that time totally disabled, incapable of engaging in employment, and ineligible for any compensation under Florida's Workers' Compensation law for an indeterminate period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order was reversed.

Stat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a habitual felony offender, appealed his sentence for third-degree murder to life imprisonment, with a 25 year mandatory minimum, pursuant to Florida's 10/20/Life statute. Defense counsel argued that such a sentence would be inappropriate since the shooting was an accident and there was no evidence put forth at trial to say that he had any intent to shoot the victim. Defendant argued that &sect; 775.087(2)(a)3., Fla. Stat. should not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court had held that the evidence demonstrated only an accidental shooting, vacated his conviction for second-degree murder and remanded for resentencing on his conviction for third-degree murder. On remand, the trial court conducted a resentencing hearing for the third-degree murder conviction. The State requested that the trial judge impose a life sentence pursuant to the 10/20/Life statute since defendant fired a gun and took the victim's life. The appellate court held that defendant's conduct fell within the purview of the statute, so the sentence was proper. It could hardly be said that the sentence was grossly disproportionate, as defendant's actions resulted in the taking of a human life. Given the severity of the crime and the deference the appellate court must give to the Legislature's decisions there was no constitutional violation in the sentence. The offense was properly reclassified as a first degree felony, punishable by up to 30 years in prison pursuant to  &sect; 775.082(3)(b), Fla. Stat. Because defendant was determined to be a habitual felony offender and the 10/20/Life reclassification applied, the life sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) sentenced defendant to concurrent sentences of life without the possibility of parole for four armed robbery convictions. The court subsequently granted defendant's motion to correct illegal sentence pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a). At a resentencing hearing, the court sentenced defendant to concurrent terms of imprisonment followed by a term of probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the resentencing court recognized defendant's efforts at rehabilitation during the years he had spent in prison, it sentenced defendant to the sentence which it deemed appropriate based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding defendant's offenses. Defendant, who was fourteen and fifteen years old when he committed a series of four armed robberies, argued that the trial court violated the requirements of the caselaw when it failed to consider defendant's rehabilitation and newfound maturity in determining what sentence to impose at the resentencing hearing. On appeal, the court found that the resentencing court complied with the requirements of the caselaw when it resentenced defendant to a sentence other than life without the possibility of parole. Had the resentencing court again imposed a life sentence, it would have been required to devise some means of providing defendant with a subsequent opportunity to seek release from that life sentence based on his demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. However, once the resentencing court imposed a nonlife sentence on defendant, its obligations were fulfilled, and defendant was not entitled to further relief.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 10, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board entered into a lease and agreement with the foundation which transferred control and operation of a hospital to the foundation. Ch. 2011-256 addressed the foundation's obligations, altered aspects of these agreements and altered the foundation's articles of incorporation. The trial court found the State could have exercised regulatory power over the functions transferred to the foundation, and thus that ch. 2011-256 did not violate Art. I, &sect; 10, Fla. Const. However, the appellate court found that the foundation was not created by the legislature and was used by the board to avoid statutory and constitutional limits which would pertained to the board as a public entity. Thus, a case relied on by the trial court did not apply. The trial court's finding that there was no impairment to the contracts because it was not shown that the taxpayers and county residents were harmed by ch. 2011-256 did not recognize the impact on the foundation's contract rights under the agreements or under its articles. Ch. 2011-256 was a rewrite of the parties' contracts and the imposition of further obligations on the foundation could not have been countenanced under Art. I, &sect; 10, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer observed defendant driving a bright green Chevy. He ran the license plate tag number through the system and learned that the plate number was registered to a blue Chevy. Because of the color inconsistency, the officer pulled over the vehicle and learned from the occupants that the vehicle had been painted recently. However, the officer smelled marijuana, conducted a search, and recovered marijuana and $ 1,100 in cash. The court held that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress as the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop on the basis of a color discrepancy alone. It was legal in Florida to repaint a vehicle without reporting the change, creating an inconsistency between the vehicle registration and the vehicle. While an officer might suspect that people driving a vehicle of an inconsistent color may be violating the law by driving with a swapped tag or driving a stolen vehicle, the officer was still required to have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school board argued that the administrative law judge (ALJ) lacked subject matter jurisdiction and erred in reversing its denial. The appellate court found, however, that the corporation's request was an effort to modify existing charter contracts and not an application for a new charter. As such, the &sect; 1002.33(6)(h), Fla. Stat. bar to the jurisdiction of Division of Administrative Hearings was inapplicable, and this dispute was not exempt from the ALJ's consideration. Competent, substantial evidence supported the ALJ's decision. Nothing showed that consolidation would not inure to the benefit of the students. The ALJ found that the request to combine the two charter schools into one charter was appropriate and consistent with the flexibility that the legislature has provided to charter schools, and met the express guides for charter schools. The evidence belied the school board's conclusion that consolidation was devoid of educational benefit to the students. Contrary to the school board's argument, &sect; 1002.33(6)(h) was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) of four counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer during a missing person investigation, in violation of &sect; 837.055, Fla. Stat. (2008). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges arose from statements which defendant made to a police detective during an investigation into the disappearance of defendant's young daughter. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the statements because defendant was not in custody at the time when she gave a recorded statement to the detective at her parents' residence or when she subsequently gave an interview to the detective in an office at a building where defendant falsely claimed to have worked. However, all four of the false statements were made by defendant in her first interview with the detective, while two of the false statements were repeated to the detective in the later interview. In light of the significant temporal break between defendant's two interviews with the detective, each interview in which false information was given (or repeated) constituted a separate criminal episode. Defendant therefore, under the Double Jeopardy Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V and Art. I, &sect; 9, Fla. Const., could have been properly convicted of only two counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer during a missing person investigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants sued appellees applicants and department, seeking a declaratory judgment that ch. 2009-170, Laws of Fla., &sect; 550.054(14)(a), (b), Fla. Stat. (Act), was a special law enacted in violation of Art. III, &sect; 10, Fla. Const. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) denied appellants' motion for summary judgment and entered summary judgment declaring that the Act was a valid general law. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found both subsections of the Act were to be construed together to determine whether the Act created a closed class, and declared the Act valid. The appellate court disagreed. The words &quot;only two&quot; in the Act meant two and not one, three, or more. Because the department's position on appeal was at odds with the plain language of the statute, it was not entitled to deference. The Act set forth, on its face, very specific limiting criteria for conversion of jai-alai permits into greyhound permits. The Act was so specific that the legislature essentially described specific counties as the ones where jai-alai permits may have been converted to greyhound permits. A witness testified that there were exactly two counties in Florida that currently qualified for conversion under &sect; 550.054(14)(a). Even if a third county had a reasonable possibility of qualifying in the future, appellants had shown that the law was special, as the addition of one county did not render the class open. The Act was one relating to, or designed to operate upon, particular persons or things, and thus was in impermissible special law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for entry of summary judgment for appellants on their request for a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional.

The absence of any authority granted to the CIP to make the sort of police management decisions addressed in Chapter 112 of the Florida Statutes, or to affect the obligations which that chapter imposed on the Miami Police Department and its investigators, made manifest the absence of a conflict between the CIP ordinance and Chapter 112. Chapter 112 concerned internal investigations conducted by a police department of its own officers, and the PBR set forth the procedures to be followed by the police department for interrogation of a law enforcement officer under investigation by the police department. The CIP's authority extended to independent, external investigations. Hence, the CIP provided a distinct function that was not prohibited by the rights and restrictions set forth in Chapter 112.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida) denied his motion to suppress, a jury convicted defendant of first-degree murder (Count One) and robbery with a deadly weapon (Count Two). The trial court sentenced defendant to a mandatory life sentence without eligibility for parole on Count One pursuant to &sect; 775.082(1), Fla. Stat. (2009), and to 45 years' incarceration on Count Two, the sentences to run consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When he committed the crimes, defendant was 16 years old. The appellate court found that the law supported the denial of the motion to suppress. Two eyewitnesses to the attack on the victim described the perpetrators and the vehicle in which they fled the scene. This resulted in a &quot;be-on-the-lookout&quot; (BOLO) report. Officers stopped the vehicle described in the BOLO over two days later, and defendant, who was an occupant of the vehicle, eventually admitted his participation in the crimes. The officers had a legitimate basis to detain and investigate defendant and the other occupants of the vehicle. The strength of the other relevant Hunter factors-the two eyewitness sources, the specificity of their descriptions of the automobile and its occupants, the fact that the officer saw no other vehicle closely matching the BOLO description, and the geographical proximity between the crime site and the detention-mitigated any concern about the lapse of 2-1/2 days between the BOLO and the sighting of the car. However, in light of a recent United States Supreme Court decision, the mandatory life sentence was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction and sentence for robbery with a deadly weapon was affirmed. The conviction for first-degree murder was affirmed, but the sentence on that conviction was reversed and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While on courthouse grounds, appellants distributed pamphlets to potential jurors that purported to instruct them about &quot;jury veto power.&quot; Though deputies informed appellants that they were violating two administrative orders, gave them copies of the orders, and advised them that continued violation of the orders could result in contempt sanctions, including incarceration, appellants continued to hand out the pamphlets. They were charged with and convicted of indirect criminal contempt. They argued that the first order violated their First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, rights because it was an unconstitutional content-based regulation of speech in a traditional public forum. The appellate court disagreed. Courthouse grounds were deemed nonpublic forums for purposes of the First Amendment, and the first order was a reasonable, viewpoint neutral regulation. However, the second order was vague and unconstitutionally overbroad, and appellants' convictions for violating it could not stand. Moreover, the trial court erred in allowing appellant one to represent himself at trial without conducting a Faretta inquiry as required by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant one's conviction was vacated.

He smelled marijuana emanating from the car and searched defendant, his passenger, and the car; he found marijuana, crack cocaine, and cash. Defendant argued on appeal that the color inconsistency alone was an insufficient basis to justify an investigatory stop under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV. The appellate court agreed. Changing the color of a vehicle was not illegal, and an owner was not required to report the change in color to the State. While an officer might suspect that a person driving a vehicle of an inconsistent color was violating the law by, for example, driving with a swapped tag, the officer was still required to have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity. Persons driving on public roads had a right to not have their travel and privacy interfered with at the unbridled discretion of police officers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Broward County Circuit Court, Seventeenth Judicial Circuit (Florida), entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of delivery of cocaine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with delivery of cocaine after he was involved in a drug deal involving a confidential informant and an undercover police detective. At his jury trial, he sought to provide evidence that he had been entrapped, but the trial court sustained the State's objection on hearsay grounds. It also sustained the State's objection to testimony about his work history. Further, it declined to instruct the jury that the State had to prove delivery to the detective despite that precise allegation in the information. Too, the trial court during a plea dialogue tried to get him to accept a certain plea. The jury found him guilty. The trial court then sentenced him. The appellate court found that: (1) sustaining the objection to the alleged hearsay was error because the evidence was offered to show a lack of predisposition, a non-hearsay purpose; (2) his work history was &sect; 90.401, Fla. Stat. (2008) evidence relevant to a lack of predisposition; (3) the trial court should have instructed the jury according to the information's allegation; (4) the trial court should not have encouraged him to accept a certain plea, which also meant that his sentence violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment of conviction and sentence, and remanded the case for a new trial to be conducted before a different trial judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county received complaints that the restaurant was violating the entertainment restrictions of the ordinance. The appellate court held that as the county was a governmental entity attempting to enforce its police power, it established the &quot;irreparable harm&quot; element necessary to obtain the injunction. The only issue was whether it was likely to succeed on the merits. Despite knowing of the ordinance's entertainment restrictions, despite the prior entry of a consent injunction, despite the denial of its application to remove the restrictions, and despite a pending administrative proceeding, the restaurant was providing outdoor entertainment until 10:30 p.m. in clear defiance of the ordinance. The restaurant offered no evidence that the ordinance was not regularly enacted, and its continuing violation of a known ordinance gave the county a clear legal right to the injunction.  The trial court abused its discretion in denying the county's request for a temporary injunction, because it thereby allowed the restaurant to violate a duly enacted, presumptively valid county ordinance during the time that its constitutionality and enforceability were being litigated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the matter for entry of the temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the Circuit Court for Okaloosa County (Florida) convicted appellant, a juvenile, of first-degree felony murder while engaged in the commission of an attempted armed robbery, and of attempted armed robbery in the course of which appellant's accomplice carried the firearm. The trial court adjudicated appellant guilty and sentenced him to a term of natural life. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole. The State conceded that the mandatory sentencing scheme for offenders who, like appellant, were under the age of eighteen when the crime was committed, violated the principle of proportionality, and so the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. The appellate court found that appropriate occasions for sentencing juveniles to mandatory life without parole under &sect;&sect; 782.04(1)(a)2.d., 775.082(1), Fla. Stat. (2009) were uncommon. A sentencer had to follow a certain process-considering an offender's youth and attendant characteristics-before imposing a particular penalty, emphasizing that youth mattered for purposes of meting out the law's most serious punishments. Ultimately, a judge or jury must have had the opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before imposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's life sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing. The sentence imposed as to count 2 was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant former employee sought review of a decision of appellee Florida Department of Management Service, Division of Retirement holding that under &sect; 112.3173, Fla. Stat. (2009), he was &quot;convicted&quot; of a specified offense based on his no-contest plea, thereby requiring the forfeiture of his Florida retirement system rights and benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued that &sect; 112.3173, by defining &quot;convicted&quot; to include a no-contest plea, regardless of the lack of a guilty plea or adjudication, unconstitutionally broadened the term &quot;convicted&quot; beyond its plain meaning as used in Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 8. The court rejected this argument. Given &sect; 8's guarantee of the people's right to secure and sustain the trust of public office] against abuse, and given the legislature's pre-existing &sect;121.091(5)(f), Fla. Stat. (1975) requiring forfeiture of benefits for a no-contest plea, the legislature was within its authority when it defined &quot;convicted&quot; in &sect; 112.3173 to include a no-contest plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), which convicted him of trafficking in twenty-eight grams or more of cocaine. Defendant contended that the warrantless search of his locked bedroom during a &quot;protective sweep&quot; of his apartment violated U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The alleged victim of a battery and a false imprisonment had the apparent authority to consent to the officers' entry into defendant's apartment as she told the officer that she had been living in the residence for the prior two weeks, that her personal belongings were inside, and that she was in a relationship with defendant. However, as the State acknowledged, the victim did not have the apparent authority to consent to a search of the locked room inside the house. Law enforcement officers were not permitted to enter the locked bedroom as part of a &quot;protective sweep&quot; to ensure officer safety as the need for a warrantless protective sweep of the locked bedroom could have readily been alleviated by the procurement of a warrant. The evidence reflected a lack of exigent circumstances, given that the officers waited outside defendant's apartment for at least one hour before forcibly entering the premises; yet, no effort was made to obtain a warrant during this time period despite knowing that there was a locked bedroom in the apartment and that they lacked consent to enter that bedroom.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeal held that based on the violent nature of defendant's crimes, his life sentences did not offend the Constitution as disproportionate. The victim of the attempted murder suffered from a brain injury and was permanently disabled, according to her testimony at sentencing. Further, in the span of three months, defendant was involved in three separate criminal episodes, all of which were of a violent nature. Defendant was correctly sentenced based on the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of the plain language of &sect; 775.087(2)(d). The statute mandated sentencing for a 10-20-Life offense consecutive to any other felony offense, whether that other felony offense was a 10-20-Life offense itself or non-10-20-Life felony. Thus, the sentences for each of the 10-20-Life crimes committed by defendant had to be imposed consecutively to each other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At defendant's trial for felony murder and robbery, the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida) admitted evidence under the common-law hearsay exception of forfeiture by wrongdoing. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court first noted that under &sect; 90.802, Fla. Stat., the only exceptions to the hearsay rule in Florida were the ones recognized by statutes. Because no statutory exception operated to authorize the admission into evidence of the witness's prior statement, the testimony was inadmissible at trial under the common-law hearsay exception. After trial, however, the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception was codified in &sect; 90.804(2)(f), Fla. Stat. Changes in laws regarding the admission of evidence, such as the creation of a new hearsay exception, were typically held to be procedural. Thus, if the court were to reverse, testimony wrongly admitted in evidence at the first trial would be properly admitted at a second trial due to a procedural change in the law of evidence. The witness's prior testimony was cumulative to other evidence. Under these circumstances, reversal was not justified because the error committed at trial neither affected the substantial rights of defendant under &sect; 924.33, Fla. Stat. (2010) nor resulted in a miscarriage of justice under &sect; 59.041, Fla. Stat. (2010).</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that he was denied a fair trial when the prosecution elicited testimony that he committed an unrelated crime on the night of his arrest. The appellate court disagreed because this issue was not properly preserved for appellate review, did not constitute fundamental error, and one of the two comments was invited by the defense. Defendant did not move for a mistrial after the trial court sustained his objection to the initial comment and failed to contemporaneously object to the second comment. The first comment did not constitute fundamental error, and the second comment was elicited by the defense. If this alleged error were preserved, it would have been subject to the invited error doctrine. Section 893.135, Fla. Stat. (2009), was not facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation contended that the dismissal was erroneous and that it was exempt from unemployment taxation pursuant to &sect; 443.1216(4)(a)2., Fla. Stat. (2009), because it is operated primarily for religious purposes and is controlled by a church. The corporation was nonprofit and was formed to promote and support the arts by providing instruction in public schools and in after-school programs. The Department mailed an Independent Contractor Determination to the corporation, informing it that the individuals named therein constituted employees for purposes of unemployment compensation and that it was still required to submit quarterly reports to include the workers and to pay tax on the wages. The Department informed the corporation that it owed unemployment tax. The corporation argued that it was exempt because it operated primarily for religious purposes and was supervised by a church. The court agreed the special deputy erred in finding that the corporation was not controlled by a church. However, the deputy's finding regarding its primary purpose in operating was supported by substantial evidence as the primary purpose was to give art instruction to underprivileged children.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2010). The trial court imposed a sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A sheriff's deputy found defendant lying on the ground in the rain, seemingly passed out. The deputy approached defendant, asked for identification, and accompanied defendant, who appeared to the deputy to have been intoxicated, as he went voluntarily to retrieve his wallet and license from his nearby truck. Defendant showed his license to the deputy. It appeared to the deputy that defendant, while returning his wallet to driver's seat, tried to obscure a plastic bag containing several pills which were lying on the seat. The deputy told defendant to step aside, removed the bag of pills and, holding the bag, asked defendant what the pills were. Defendant answered that they were Lortab pills, and then volunteered that he had just purchased them. He further volunteered that he had gone to jail for this before. On appeal, the court found that the encounter became an investigatory stop. Further, the investigatory detention of defendant was invalid for lack of reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, and the seizure of the pills was invalid for lack of probable cause. Accordingly, defendant's statements and the physical evidence which the deputy obtained should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction and sentence were reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for the court to grant defendant's motions to suppress and to discharge defendant for the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under a negotiated plea agreement, defendant pled guilty to two counts of lewd or lascivious battery, violations of &sect; 800.04(4)(a), Fla. Stat. (2003), and was sentenced to three years of community control followed by seven years of sex offender probation. Six years later, the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) granted early termination of her probation under &sect; 948.05, Fla. Stat. (2003). The State filed a petition for certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As an express condition of her plea agreement, defendant agreed to serve her entire sentence and to not seek early termination of probation. Nonetheless, she sought termination of her probation four years early in direct violation of the plea agreement. While the State had no right of appeal in the case, this was an extraordinary circumstance under which the State was entitled to seek common law certiorari review in the absence of a right to appeal. The court certified this question as of great public importance. With regard to the merits of the appeal, the circuit court was required to honor the negotiated plea agreement which it had previously accepted. The State was not prohibited from using the no early termination provision in the negotiated plea agreement, the provision did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers, and defendant was bound by the provision. Because the intent of the plea agreement was that defendant would not receive early termination of her probation, the circuit court was obligated to deny defendant's motion for early termination of her probation or, at the very least, to permit the State to withdraw from the plea agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the State's petition writ of certiorari, quashed the order of the circuit court, and remanded with instructions that defendant's probation be reinstated pursuant to the terms and conditions of her negotiated plea agreement and original sentence in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant juvenile was adjudicated delinquent after he pled no contest to lewd and lascivious molestation. The State filed a petition for involuntarily commitment as a sexually violent predator under the Jimmy Ryce Act. The Circuit Court for Bay County (Florida) denied his motion to dismiss the petition. His continuance motion was denied, he was found to be a sexually violent predator, and ordered committed. Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the petition because a trial was not held within 30 days of the probable cause hearing as required by &sect; 394.916, Fla. Stat. (2009) and Fla. R. Civ. P. 4.240(a). The appellate court held that, because the delay in the commitment trial was made for tactical reasons at his own request, appellant's detention did not result in a constitutional violation. The record established a pattern followed by both assistant public defenders in seeking continuances and delaying the trial, thereby undermining any claim that appellant did not invite error. Appellant actively sought and intended his case to be continued on three occasions. Thus, the mandatory legislative time requirements and the requirements set forth in the rules were waived due to the continuances sought. Appellant could not &quot;cry foul&quot; and benefit from the invited error. Finally, even though the trial court did not grant appellant's final request for a continuance, doing so would have reinforced the conclusion that strict compliance with the 30-day trial requirement was waived.</SPAN></P>
