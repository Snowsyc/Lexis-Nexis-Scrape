</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the daughter dated. They also both used drugs. On June 2, 2004, around 4:30 a.m., defendant went into his living room to speak with the daughter, only to find her dead. On June 2, 2004, at approximately 10:30 p.m., he wrapped her body in a mattress cover, secured it with duct tape and speaker wire, and placed the body in his vehicle. On June 5, 2004, he met with his attorney. The attorney notified the police of the body in defendant's vehicle. The daughter's funeral services were closed casket. The parents were told by the mortician that her body was too bloated to wear a family ring or clothing. The parents brought an action against defendant for interference with the right of sepulcher and burial. A jury awarded $ 250,000 to each parent for compensatory damages. On appeal, the court found that the facts alleged by the parents in their petition sufficiently established a legal duty on the part of defendant; that was all that was required. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict. Defendant failed to show how a medical examiner's testimony would have had any relevance to any issue in the case before the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant voters filed an action against respondents, the Secretary of State and the State Auditor. They challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, which dismissed their challenge to the certification of a statewide ballot measure. The voters argued that the initiative petition violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 50 and that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 116.050 required the initiative to list sections that would be modified or repealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in finding that the measure's central purpose was the regulation of gambling and gambling revenues. The proposition effected multiple changes in the regulation of Missouri gaming, provided for a fund for gambling revenues, and directed how those gambling funds were to be managed and used. The central purpose of the proposition was the regulation of gambling and gambling revenue, and its provisions for fund regulation were incidental to that purpose. Section 116.050 did not require the initiative to list sections that would be directly modified or repealed by its enactment. The proposition's limitation on the number of licenses that could be issued was a limitation on the authority of the Gaming Commission granted by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 313.812.1, 313.805, and 313.004. Therefore, it affected or modified those provisions, but the proposition was not so irreconcilable with those provisions that it necessarily negated them. Consequently, they were not deleted or repealed. The trial court properly refused to reach the merits of the substantive issues of the constitutionality of the proposal as not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a grant of summary judgment by the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (Missouri) in favor of respondent property owners pursuant to the owners' petition for declaratory judgment and an injunction from the enforcement of ordinances annexing certain property in accordance with petitions for voluntary annexation under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.014 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought to annex the right of way of a road from the existing city limits for a length of about 1,700 feet, together with two tracts of land located on either sides of the road. The owners contended that the road and tracts were compact to the pre-annexation boundaries of the city as required under &sect; 71.014. On review, the court affirmed. The court agreed with precedent that &quot;flag annexation,&quot; such as that contemplated by the city, did not meet the test of compactness under &sect; 71.014 in that the annexation did not make the city's boundaries more regular and the annexed area and the city would not be one closely-grouped, solid tract of land. Additionally, the compact requirement did not violate due process or the right to contract under the U.S. Constitution or Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, and Mo. Const. art. 5, &sect; 3, because the city did not establish that there was a contract and the claim was not real and substantial. Finally, the city's claim under the U.S. Constitution and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, that the interpretation of contiguous and compact was an unconstitutional impairment of the parties' right to peaceably assemble, was also not real and substantial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Lafayette County (Missouri), which dismissed his Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 29.07(d) motion to withdraw his guilty plea to sodomy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1997, defendant pled guilty to sodomy and received a seven-year sentence with execution suspended. He completed his probation successfully and was discharged from probation in 2002. Four years later, he filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground of manifest injustice. He based his claim on the victim's recantation of her allegations. The trial court dismissed the motion on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion because it was untimely. On appeal, the court held that because defendant received a suspended execution of sentence and was never sent to the Missouri Department of Corrections (DOC), his motion was timely and could have been raised under Rule 29.07 rather than a writ of habeas corpus. Because he was never committed to the DOC, a time limit under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 never began to run. The trial court, therefore, erred in finding that it had no jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings, including the presentation of evidence, if desired, by the State, which stood on its motion to dismiss at the close of defendant's evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Missouri Dam and Reservoir Safety Council, filed a petition in Green County Circuit Court (Missouri) seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties against respondent dam owners pursuant to the Missouri Dam and Reservoir Safety Laws, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 236.400 et seq. (2000). The trial court entered summary judgment for the owners. The Council appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Council alleged that the owners' dam had an insufficient emergency spillway. The owners claimed that the dam was built in 1974 and that retrospective application of the safety laws was unconstitutional. They also claimed that the dam was a soil and water conservation dam that was exempt from the safety laws pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 236.435.7 (2000). The appellate court held that &sect; 236.435.7 exempted soil and conservation dams only from the permitting requirements under &sect; 236.435 and that the registration and safety permit requirements under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 236.440 (2000) still applied. The owners therefore were not entitled to summary judgment based on &sect; 236.435.7. However, the owners raised a substantial constitutional challenge based on Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, which prohibited retrospective laws, as &sect; 236.440 imposed new safety and permitting requirements on dams that were built prior to the statute's enactment. The matter therefore fell within the Missouri Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's grant of summary judgment was reversed insofar as it might have been based on the owners' statutory exemption claim. The constitutional challenge was transferred to the Missouri Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neurosurgeon's license was placed on probation as a result of his treatment of two patients. On appeal, the court held that the board erred by disciplining the neurosurgeon's license for unprofessional conduct under &sect; 334.100.2(4) and for incompetence under &sect; 334.100.2(5) because the issues could not be determined by common opinion and the board failed to present any expert testimony that any conduct was unprofessional. However, the board did not err by disciplining the neurosurgeon's license for engaging in conduct that might be harmful under &sect; 334.100.2(5) because experts testified that he performed an inappropriate operation on one patient and he falsely reported good fusion in the second patient's spine following surgery. The board did not err by disciplining the neurosurgeon's license for engaging in conduct harmful to mental or physical health under &sect; 334.100.2(5) because he performed a series of negligent acts in treating the second patient, which, according to one of the board's experts, resulted in a failed fusion and ultimately in the patient's burning leg pain. The board did not err in disciplining the license for repeated negligence under &sect; 334.100.2(5).</SPAN></P>

Based upon the fact that defendant stabbed the victim 34 times, as disclosed in the autopsy report admitted into evidence, coupled with defendant's admission that he killed the victim by stabbing her, the trial court could have reasonably inferred that defendant acted with the purpose of causing the victim serious physical injury, as required under Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant Department of Corrections (DOC) in the Circuit Court of Moniteau County, Missouri. The prisoner sought jail-time credit for his incarceration in a city jail while awaiting the disposition of a county charge. The DOC filed for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was arrested by city police for aggravated stalking and associated offenses. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. While the prisoner was in jail, the county filed a detainer against him for first-degree robbery and third-degree domestic assault. He was transferred to the county jail to await the disposition of those charges. He eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced, to run concurrently with the city convictions. The prisoner argued that he was entitled to 15 months of jail-time credit for the second-degree robbery conviction because his incarceration was related to that offense. The DOC argued that his incarceration was due to the aggravated stalking offense. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.031.1 (2000 and Cum. Supp. 2006) required only that incarceration be &quot;related to&quot; the robbery offense; therefore, summary judgment was in error. The prisoner's custody could be related to both the stalking and the robbery offenses and the statutory credit would nevertheless apply. The prisoner produced evidence that the robbery charge would have prevented him from being released assuming he posted bond on the city charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment of the circuit court and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Dekalb County (Missouri), which, in a condemnation action, ordered that the owners refund the difference between a commission's award and a jury's award and pay statutory interest to respondent, the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission (MTHC).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The MHTC sought to condemn property for a highway improvement project. A commission determined the amount of just compensation for the taking. The owners withdrew the award. A jury later determined that just compensation for the land was substantially less than what was ordered by the commission. The trial court ordered that the owners refund the difference between the awards and pay statutory interest as mandated by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 523.045 (2000). On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in refusing to either hold an evidentiary hearing or grant a mistrial to address alleged jury nondisclosure during voir dire. A question during voir dire regarding &quot;personal involvement with a civil suit&quot; was ambiguous as far as it related to a juror's limited connection with her husband's bankruptcy. Further, the trial court did not err under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 227.050 or Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 86.04 in permitting the admission of a maintenance and improvement agreement between the Missouri Department of Transportation and the county. The condition of the county roads was at issue because the condition of the roads limited the owners' farming operation after the taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a letter, appellant, the Missouri Director of Revenue, denied the application for a driver's license filed by respondent applicant. The letter explained that, because the applicant had been convicted for three or more driving while intoxicated offenses, he was ineligible for a driver's license for 10 years from the date of his last offense. The Circuit Court of Adair County (Missouri) reversed the Director's decision. The Director appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court found that the driving records from the State of Iowa were not legally sufficient to support the Director's decision. There was no dispute that the applicant was convicted of driving while intoxicated in Missouri. Also, he was twice convicted of driving while intoxicated in Iowa. The Iowa records admitted into evidence by stipulation of the parties were the administrative record relied on by the Director in making his decision. An affidavit was attached to those records certifying that they were used in the regular course of business of the Iowa Department of Revenue and that they were duplicates of the original records deposited with the Iowa Department of Revenue. Thus, the appellate court held that the Iowa records were legally sufficient to satisfy the Director's burden of production. Furthermore, the applicant did not show that the records that the Director relied on were either unlawful, unconstitutional, or otherwise insufficient under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 to support the Director's action. Thus, the Director's denial of the applicant's license should have been affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the circuit court's judgment and reinstated the Director's decision denying the applicant's driver's license application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission (AHC) dismissed appellant motor vehicle dealership's application for review contesting the actions of respondent manufacturer establishing a new dealership or sales point within 10 miles of the dealership's retail facility. It found that the dealership's complaint was not cognizable under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 407.285(1) (2000) and that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. The dealership appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question before the appellate court was whether the dealership could use Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 407.825(1) (2000) of the Motor Vehicle Franchise Practices Act (MVFPA) to challenge the manufacturer's conduct in establishing a new sales point near the dealership's current location. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 407.817 provided a procedural hurdle for manufacturers seeking to establish or relocate a sales point within a certain proximity of an existing dealership. The appellate court found that &sect; 407.817 was drafted as a preliminary roadblock to protect dealerships from unnecessary competition in markets that would not support additional sales points. It did not reduce the protections already afforded by &sect; 407.825(1), which prevented capricious, bad faith, and unconscionable conduct with respect to any dealings between a manufacturer and a dealership. The AHC had jurisdiction to hear the dealership's application regarding the behavior of the manufacturer that resulted in the addition of a sales point. The fact that the dealership decided when to seek the protection of the MVFPA did not amount to an unconstitutional delegation of state power and did not produce a due process violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded to the AHC for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Greene County, Missouri issued an injunction ordering removal of respondent registrant--who pled guilty to possession of child pornography, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.037 (2002)--from all sexual offender registries and expungement from government records of any personal information relating to the registrant. Appellant Superintendent of the Missouri State Highway Patrol appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The requirement under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 589.400 of registration as a sexual offender did not apply to convictions for possession of child pornography until that statute was amended after the registrant pled guilty, Therefore, the Superintendent did not challenge the finding that the original listing of the registrant violated the prohibition of retrospective operation of laws set forth in Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The trial court properly ordered the Superintendent to delete any personal information pertaining to the registrant that had been obtained as a result of his unlawful registration. Allowing the Superintendent to continue to maintain, use, and publish that information would have resulted in a wrong without a remedy. However, the trial court erred in ordering permanent expungement of the registrant from all sex offender registries and permanent relief of any requirement to register because, should he again be convicted of committing any of the offenses currently requiring registration, he would be required to register.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded for entry of an amended judgment that required the registrant's current removal from the registry but excluded any provision requiring the registrant's permanent exclusion. In all other respects, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One day before a general election, appellant, the Republican candidate for county commissioner, filed a petition contesting the qualifications of respondent, the Democratic candidate.

Appellant filed a second petition, alleging that irregularities occurred in the general election. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss. The trial court dismissed both petitions. On appeal, the court found that appellant's first petition was properly dismissed because it was untimely under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 115.526.2 (2000 &amp; Cum. Supp. 2006). The petition was filed more than five days after the latest date for certification. The second petition was properly dismissed because the petition's basis for stating there was an irregularity sufficient to cast doubt upon the validity of the election did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Additionally, the second petition was essentially a challenge to respondent's qualifications, and, therefore, the time requirements of &sect; 115.526.2 applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an employer and its insurer, brought a declaratory judgment action against respondents, an employee and the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission, in the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri). The circuit court granted the employee's motion to dismiss because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.050 did not authorize a declaratory judgment and res judicata barred appellants' claim. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured at work and sought and received temporary disability benefits. Appellants sought review of the award as to the employee's back only from the Labor and Industrial Relations Commission, which refused to review an award of temporary benefits pursuant to Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 20-3.040(2). Appellants then sought review of that decision in circuit court, which also dismissed the claim. Appellants then filed their declaratory judgment action, alleging that &sect; 20-3.040 violated U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV and Mo. Const. art.  I, &sect; 10. The court found that because appellants were directly attacking the validity of &sect; 3.040 and not the application of the rule to the particular facts of their case, their case was different from past cases in which the attack was entwined with factual issues pending before the commission. In this case, the sole issue before the commission was whether the employee was entitled to benefits for his back injury. The circuit court's declaration concerning the constitutionality of &sect; 3.040 would have no effect on that issue. Therefore, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.050 authorized appellants' declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">We reverse the circuit court's judgment dismissing Motor Control's and Ohio Casualty's declaratory judgment petition and remand to the circuit court to convert its decision to a ruling on the merits of their petition. This decision renders moot Petelik's appeal of the denial of his request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that the trial court erred in determining that it did not have subject matter of his petition. The appellate court noted that the inmate asserted that he asked the trial court to address &quot;enforcement of the prison term imposed&quot; and to declare that the sentences were not authorized by law, or not enforceable. This was clearly an attack on the validity of his sentence, which was inappropriate for a declaratory judgment action. The inmate's contention that the judgment was void because the judge granted the motion and signed the judgment after he had been recused had no merit because there was no indication that the judge took any action on the case after it was reassigned to another judge. The trial court erred in dismissing the inmate's petition with prejudice because the dismissal was for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state police superintendent sought review of the portion of a judgment of the Jackson County Circuit Court (Missouri), which required removal of information relating to respondent former convict that was already contained in the sex offender registry of the State of Missouri.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superintendent was enjoined from using information obtained through an unlawful sex offender registration. The information was determined to be unlawfully placed on the registration pursuant to Missouri's Sex Offender Registration Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 589.400 through 589.425, because the convict's crime was not placed on the list of offenses on the registry until after the convict entered a guilty plea to the crime. On appeal, the court agreed that to ensure complete justice, equity required eliminating access to information obtained during the unconstitutional registration process. Futhermore, it was not shown that the information was obtained from public sources. Finally, the court held that equity required not having access to information that was obtained through an unconstitutional statutory provision. The focus was on how the information was obtained; it was not on how the unlawfully obtained information would be used or accessed in the future. Accordingly, that only certain persons would have access to the information did not impact the analysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician argued that the Board erred in revoking his medical license for incompetency. The appellate court found that the physician did not demonstrate that the Board acted arbitrarily as to him in requiring a probable cause hearing. The probable cause hearing was investigatory and not adjudicatory. The procedure used by the Board at the probable cause hearing did not allow (and was not required to allow) cross--examination of the Board members who asked questions of the physician and did not include the opportunity for him to present evidence on his behalf. However, the Board relied upon and specifically found, as a basis for its finding of incompetency, the inadequacies in the answers the physician gave at the probable cause hearing. The Board could not do this without affording the physician minimal due process rights including an opportunity to cross--examine a witness explaining those inadequacies and a meaningful opportunity to present evidence contesting any perceived deficiencies in his responses at the probable cause hearing. The appellate court was not convinced that the Board itself intended for the Special Purpose Examination results to be the sole criteria.</SPAN></P>

The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the mother contended, inter alia, that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction and erroneously applied the law in setting aside the first amended judgment and in entering a second amended judgment as it failed to first respond to the mother's motion for new trial/amend judgment. The appellate court agreed, finding that during the 90-day period provided for in Mo. Sup. Ct. R.  81.05, the trial court was limited to either granting or denying the specific requests stated in the mother's motion. However, prior to the hearing, the trial court entered its second amended judgment which altered the end date for the child's Christmas vacation visitation, but did not take any of the actions requested in the mother's motion. During the 90-day period provided by Rule 81.05, the trial court only had the authority to address the three issues raised in the mother's motion and no other issues. Since the trial court amended its judgment in a manner not requested by the mother, the appellate court held that the trial court erred in entering the second amended judgment.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 287.067 (2000) for an alleged mold-induced allergy which she contended was developed while employed as a teacher with respondent employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that she was held to a higher burden of proof than required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.020 (2000), in that the Commission stated that she could have been exposed to the mold at any number of locations and any exposure could have been sufficient to cause her condition. The reviewing court found that, contrary to the employee's argument, there was evidence that the employee was exposed to the mold other than in classrooms; specifically the employer's expert testified that Aspergillus Niger was everywhere. The employer's expert also found no evidence that the employee was exposed to a concentration of the mold in the school that was even as high as that to which she was exposed outside or at home. Thus, he said, there was nothing to support the development of sensitization to molds in the school. His testimony was consistent with other experts and environmental air samples. Although the employee's experts provided contrary evidence, the credibility determination was properly made by the Commission. There was also no error in a vote by a member of the Commission who participated in the defense of the case because the vote was required by the rule of necessity.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the State's claim. The husband's estate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's wife received Medicaid benefits for 12 years until her death. No probate estate was administered for her. Thereafter, her husband died. He never received Medicaid benefits. His estate consisted of a house and an automobile. He had owned the house jointly with his wife as tenants by the entirety. His estate was liquidated to $ 97,000. The estate asserted that the circuit court erred because, although Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.399 (2000) permitted the State to seek reimbursement from a spouse's estate, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396p forbade such a claim and preempted Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.399 pursuant to the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. Property owned by the couple as tenants by the entirety was not part of the wife's probate estate and did not fit within the definition of &quot;estate&quot; enunciated in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 472.010(11). Even assuming that the State was a creditor that could make a claim under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 461.300, the house owned as tenants by the entirety was not a recoverable transfer under &sect; 461.300.10(4).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.087.1 allowed an award of fees only in an agency proceeding or civil action arising therefrom. An &quot;agency proceeding&quot; was defined by Mo. Rev.

Stat. &sect; 536.010(4), a &quot;contested case&quot; meant a proceeding before an agency in which a party's legal rights were required by law to be determined after a hearing. The court held that the complainant was not entitled to an award of fees and expenses because the underlying agency action the complainant challenged, the Commission's administrative closure of its file concerning his discrimination complaint without conducting an investigation, making a probable-cause determination, or issuing a right-to-sue letter, was not a &quot;contested case&quot; within the meaning of Mo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Marion County (Missouri), which convicted him of establishing residency within 1,000 feet of a school, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.147 (Supp. 2004). Defendant filed a motion to transfer the case to the Missouri Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was released from custody after serving sentences for statutory sodomy in the second degree and sexual misconduct. At the time of his release, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.147 (Supp. 2004) required that he not &quot;establish residency&quot; within 1,000 feet of a school. He was later found guilty of establishing residency within 1,000 feet of a school. The trial court sentenced him to four years in prison, with a 120-day callback. On appeal, the court found that defendant did not raise his claim regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 566.147 until appeal. However, he had an opportunity to raise the constitutional challenge before trial in a motion to quash the information; he did not file such a motion. Further, the State adduced sufficient evidence to support an inference that defendant knew that he established residency within 1,000 feet of a school. There was evidence that the school accommodated eight grades of students plus kindergarten and pre-kindergarten, and had three playgrounds, one of which had playground equipment. The school, the main playground, and playground equipment were visible from defendant's residence. The trial court did not err in denying his motion for acquittal.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 287.020.10 (2005) did not abrogate case law interpretations. The Commission did not err in finding that the employee's condition was idiopathic given the dearth of authority supporting the claim that his seizure disorder was not innate. The definition of idiopathic did not cause Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.020 (2005) to conflict with the Americans with Disabilities Act as the employee failed to show that denial of compensation for injuries related to idiopathic causes was more likely due to disability. The definition did not render &sect; 287.020 violative of the open courts provision of the Missouri Constitution where the employee disagreed with the ultimate outcome. The definition did not render &sect; 287.020 violative of equal protection as distinguishing between injuries caused by idiopathic conditions and unrelated injuries was rationally related to compensating injured employees. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.020.3(3) (2005) was properly applied as a vast number of idiopathic causes could render a resultant injury noncompensable and it abrogated case law concerning when the workplace increased the risk of an accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent City appealed the decision of appellants, the St. Louis County Boundary Commission and its constituents (Commission), to deny its annexation proposal, seeking review of the decision as a non-contested case. Finding that the Commission's denial was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable, the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, denied the Commission's motion to dismiss and reversed the denial. The Commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the Commission contended: the circuit court erred in denying its motion to dismiss the City's petition because it failed to state a claim for non-contested case review; and the circuit court erred in reversing the Commission's denial of the City's annexation proposal. The appellate court disagreed on both points, finding first that the public hearing lacked certain formalities: the City was limited to a 15-minute presentation at the public hearing; witnesses did not give testimony upon oath or affirmation; there was no cross-examination of witnesses; and there was no formal adherence to procedural rules of evidence. Further, the procedural right of a public hearing did not create any substantive legal right in a &quot;named party&quot; because no governmental authority or person had any legal right in the boundaries of the City. As such, the case before the Commission was non-contested. The appellate court also found that the circuit court's conclusion that the Commission's decision denying the proposal was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable was supported by its findings that the annexation proposal was in the best interests of the affected parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion to suppress and admitting evidence derived from a search of the vehicle in which defendant was riding. After the vehicle was stopped for speeding, the driver consented to a search of the vehicle. Defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle. Based on the totality of the circumstances, the officer had probable cause to search the vehicle and any containers located within it where narcotics might be found. The vehicle had out-of-state license plates, was traveling in a known drug corridor, and defendant and the driver both exhibited involuntary mouth and facial movements that indicated to the officer a person who was high on methamphetamine. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for acquittal. Based on defendant's equivocal answers regarding ownership of a bag found in the vehicle and his unsolicited statement that he was &quot;not selling,&quot; it was reasonable to infer that his actions evidenced a consciousness of guilt and that he knew that a scale and methamphetamine residue were in the bag.</SPAN></P>

The Commission upheld a decision that the employees were not ineligible for benefits during the relevant time frame due to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 288.040.6(2) (2004). On appeal, the employer challenged the constitutional validity of &sect; 288.040.6(2). The court found that the constitutional issue was preserved because the employer attacked the constitutional validity of the statute at its first opportunity to be heard. It also presented its position on the constitutional issues to the Commission. As such, the constitutional issues were preserved. The employer's argument that &sect; 288.040.6(2) violated its right to equal protection of the laws was not merely colorable. Accordingly, the court lacked jurisdiction over the case.</SPAN></P>

The trial court was free to reject the individual's testimony as uncredible. It may have concluded that he was fully aware that the victim did not want him following or staring at her. The victim testified that the individual's actions had frightened and alarmed her and that she felt threatened, scared, and feared physical harm from the individual. The record also supported a finding that the victim's fear was reasonable. The individual had engaged in a pattern of following the victim and/or exposing her to unwanted contact with him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty, after a bench trial before the Circuit Court of Cooper County, Missouri, of misdemeanor third-degree domestic assault, pursuant to Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record indicated that a jury trial had been waived. On appeal, defendant raised two issues: (1) the constitutionality of the statute providing that, where no jury trial was demanded, a bench trial would be provided for defendants charged with misdemeanors; and (2) the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court's judgment. The constitutional question was not properly preserved for appellate review because the issue was not raised before the trial. Further, defendant had notice there would be a bench trial, and defendant made no request for a jury prior to proceeding to trial. The testimony of defendant's wife and the responding deputies was that the wife, scared and crying, had fled to a neighbor's house to call the sheriff. Defendant pointed to a single, isolated answer of &quot;no&quot; by his wife, who had discernible difficulty with English, to the question of whether she found defendant's conduct offensive. Defendant argued that this single response negated the substantial evidence presented by the State. Upon review of the record, the appellate court determined that the trial court's judgment was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of first-degree murder in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.020 (2000) and one count of kidnapping in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.110 (2000). The Circuit Court of Pulaski County (Missouri) sentenced defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment for life without parole for first-degree murder and 15 years for kidnapping. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Given the totality of the circumstances (that the case was a murder case involving a crime against a man by a man, that there were no real issues tied to gender, and the jury ultimately rejected the death penalty), the trial court did not err in denying defendant's claim that two venirewomen were improperly stricken because of their gender. Defendant also averred that his statements made to the police after a deal was entered into with the prosecutor should have been suppressed at trial because of the &quot;promise of leniency&quot; by the prosecutor. However, substantial evidence supported the trial court in that there was no coercion in the proffer of leniency, and defendant was given full warning in the Miranda warnings and by the prosecutor's letter that his statements would be used against him and he would be charged with murder if he was involved in the actual murder or if he lied in his statement to the police. Also, the jury instruction, which attributed the conduct element of shooting the victim to defendant or the accomplice and instructed the jury that defendant &quot;acted together with&quot; the accomplice, was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician challenged a judgment of the Missouri Circuit Court of the St. Charles County, which, upon remand, affirmed the decision of the Administrative Hearing Commission (AHC) and respondent Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts (Board). The AHC and Board publicly reprimanded the physician and forbade him from prescribing medication over the Internet for violating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 334.100.2(4)(h) (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Physician reviewed a consultation form submitted by an undercover agent over the Internet and issued a prescription for weight loss medication without ever examining the agent or confirming the information in the online form. The AHC found that the physician prescribed a controlled substance without a sufficient medical examination in violation of &sect; 334.100.2(4)(h). On appeal, the court found that the physician was not disciplined for having a practice that involved prescribing over the Internet, as claimed by the physician, but rather for the specific act of prescribing medicine to the undercover agent without performing a sufficient examination. The lack of statutes or regulations expressly pertaining to the Internet did not mean that the physician's conduct was not controlled by existing legislation. The language of &sect; 334.100.2(4)(h) gave the physician sufficient notice, and substantial evidence supported the AHC's conclusion. That the circuit court reversed a prior judgment in the physician's favor upon remand after receiving the entire record that was previously unavailable was not a denial of due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant student, by and through his next friend, appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Missouri) affirming the student's suspension from school by respondent school district for violations of the school's weapons policy. The student argued that the items he brought to the school did not properly qualify under any of the definitions in the school's weapons policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was suspended for one year for possessing, and using on one occasion, toy guns on school grounds. The guns were spring loaded and shot plastic BB-like pellets. The school board adopted a separate weapons &quot;guide,&quot; including the definition of a weapon, and although not handed out, the guidelines were accessible to parents and students. Statutory authority specifically stated that each school district could make all needful rules and regulations for the organization, grading, and government in the school district. Substantial evidence supported a finding that the guidelines were properly applicable to the student. Regardless of whether the guns were projectile weapons or dangerous weapons, substantial evidence established that they were designed to imitate a firearm as defined in 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 930(g)(2). The guns could have caused injury if fired at another person and one of them resembled a real firearm. The student's second point was denied because he stated an abstract statement of law that did not comply with Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 84.04(d)(4) and was unreviewable.</SPAN></P>

The consumer cross-appealed the denial of his motion to amend the judgment against the company to include prejudgment interest and the finding in favor of respondent, a doctor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company appealed the judgment entered upon a jury verdict in favor of the consumer on his claims of products liability and negligent manufacture. After the consumer had received a second dose of an oral polio vaccine, resulting weakness developed into permanent paralysis in his left arm and some weakness in both hands. The consumer cross-appealed the trial court's denial of his motion to amend the judgment against the company to include prejudgment interest and further appealed the judgment entered in favor of the doctor on the consumer's claim of medical malpractice. The prejudgment interest ruling was reversed. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 408.040.2 (2000) did not allow the trial court discretion to deny prejudgment interest once the statutory conditions were met; the consumer met the statutory conditions. The remainder of the opinion was affirmed. The appellate court disagreed with the company's characterization of an expert's testimony as only raising the possibility that inadequately tested vaccines would more likely cause polio. That the consumer presented sufficient evidence on the element of causation to make a submissible case was not based solely on the expert's testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after a police officer discovered marijuana in the vehicle defendant was driving, which had been pulled over for a traffic violation. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The evidence showed that defendant was present with another person in the vehicle at the time of the stop and that at that time the vehicle had marijuana concealed inside its backseat, rear quarter panels, and trunk. That evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant had knowledge or awareness of the presence of marijuana hidden in the vehicle. The fact that the marijuana smelled like axel grease did not give rise to the inference that defendant could detect the aroma or otherwise differentiate it from the axle grease that was normally and routinely found in a vehicle. There was also no evidence that the pulled-out carpet, loose seat, and loose wall panels were so open and obvious that a person sitting in the driver's seat would or could not fail to observe them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of first-degree robbery and sentenced to 25 years in prison. The Attorney General filed a petition for incarceration reimbursement under the MIRA. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the State. On appeal, the court found that the inmate was offered the opportunity to provide written reasons as to why the Attorney General did not have good cause to file a MIRA petition when the trial court issued a show cause order. Therefore, his due process rights were not violated. However, the court found that the Attorney General did not have good cause to file the petition. The balance of the account was $ 1,770, so the inmate's assets at the time of filing were insufficient to satisfy the 10 percent threshold under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.831.1. The Attorney General did not claim that the inmate had a stream of income, as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.831.3. Deposits made by friends and family did not constitute &quot;a stream of income&quot; that could satisfy the 10 percent threshold within five years because the friends and family stated that the deposits would cease.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a petition seeking a writ of mandamus ordering respondent Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) to revoke the license it issued, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 198.022, to respondent corporation to operate a skilled nursing facility. The Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, dismissed the petition, finding that appellants lacked standing. Appellants challenged the dismissal of their petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Whether appellants had standing to attack the issuance of the certificate of need was totally irrelevant to the issue presented in their petition, such that the fact that they lacked standing as to that issue was irrelevant and could not form the basis for the trial court's dismissal. However, it was not error to dismiss for a lack of standing on the alternative ground that appellants lacked standing to challenge the issuance of the license to the corporation by the DHSS to operate the facility. By the express wording of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 198.039.1, the legislature had limited appeals of licensing decisions by the DHSS to persons who had been aggrieved by a decision of the DHSS refusing to issue a license or to revoke a license already issued. The legislature did not intend to confer standing on a third party, not otherwise a party to the licensing proceeding, to challenge the DHSS's decision to grant a license to a competitor. Further, the mere fact that appellants were competitors of the corporation was not sufficient to confer standing.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The officer had no warrant nor was he making a search incident to a legal arrest for probable cause. He observed the hunting knife, a legal weapon, in a scabbard on defendant's belt, took it from defendant, and placed it in a location where it did not pose a danger to his safety. When the officer observed a bulge from an item in defendant's pocket, he &quot;patted him down.&quot; The officer did not identify the object he felt as contraband -- his testimony was that he did not know what the item was when he felt it. The officer did not know the nature of the object when he felt it through defendant's clothing. No one had observed defendant perform acts that were consistent with defendant having drugs on his person. The private property where the seizure of the container occurred was the property of defendant's mother. It was not known as a drug trafficking area.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action against the city, challenging three ordinances that required businesses and multifamily dwellings to pay fees for annual fire inspection certificates. The trial court entered a declaratory judgment in favor of plaintiffs. The trial court ordered the city to reimburse property owners for all fire inspection fees collected under the invalidated ordinances. On appeal, the court found that four of the five Keller factors weighed in favor of finding a violation of the Hancock Amendment, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22. The inspection program did not constitute a service to property owners. Further, the fees at issue did not directly relate to the level of the inspection service provided. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in invalidating the three ordinances based on the constitutional infraction. Plaintiffs were entitled to appellate attorney fees under Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The maternal grandparents, who lived in Kentucky, petitioned the trial court under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.402.1(4) (2000) for rights to visit their grandchildren, who lived in Missouri with their mother. The trial court granted the grandparents visitation rights. On appeal, the mother claimed that the trial court awarded a visitation schedule that infringed upon her parental rights to raise her children. The court found that the visitation order constituted more than a minimal intrusion to the mother's family, which consisted of her two children, her new husband, and her husband's two children, who were in college. The mother and her husband desired to develop relationships with each other's children and for their children to develop relationships with each other. Because the mother and her husband both worked, the weekends and holidays were their only opportunities to bond as a family. The frequency of the grandparents' visitation would leave fewer options for the family to socialize as a unit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court to order visitation that was less frequent and more flexible.</SPAN></P>

The employer provided the employee with $ 10,635 in medical benefits and continued to pay him under his contract after the injury. The court determined that the Commission did not err in finding that the employer was entitled to a credit for wages paid after the date of his injury pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.270 because an exception was created for professional athletes under a contract, giving the employer a credit for &quot;wages or benefits&quot; paid to the athlete &quot;after the injury.&quot; There was no limitation or qualification to this credit in the statute, and there was no distinction made between whether the athlete was temporarily totally disabled or permanently partially disabled. Section 287.270 was constitutional because (1) it did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the Missouri Constitution and the U.S. Constitution since the exclusion of professional athletes under contract had a rational basis, (2) there was no denial of due process, and (3) the statute was not vague.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the limited mention of defendant's unemployment was neither crucial to nor did it bear heavily upon the determination of his guilt. Given the overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted proof that defendant was hiding and hauling 111 pounds of marijuana, using odor control, in a car with no paperwork and just one key, carrying multiple police scanners and cellular telephones, with a lame vacation story, and sweating with nervousness when the police stopped him, the limited mention of his unemployment was not prejudicial. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a detective's testimony on the marijuana's street value. Such testimony was relevant to knowledge and intent issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted knowingly exposing another person to HIV. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court plainly erred in submitting two particular instructions to the jury. He asserted that the instructions shifted the burden of proof from the State to defendant because the instructions relied on &sect; 191.677. The court found that even if the jury instruction on the use of condoms was not given to the jury, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find defendant guilty of the crime. The court did not find facially substantial grounds to believe that a manifest injustice or a miscarriage of justice occurred. Further, defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different absent remarks from the prosecutor about what it must have been like for the victim to find out that she was HIV positive. Finally, defendant was incorrectly sentenced under the 2002 version of &sect; 191.677. Because he did not engage in sexual intercourse with the victim after August 28, 2002, when the statute changed, he was to be sentenced under the 2000 version of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the search was not consensual because his statement, &quot;sure,&quot; meant he did not consent to being searched. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant's nonverbal behavior at the scene was inconsistent with his subjective, post hoc testimony at the suppression hearing that he did not intend to give consent. When the officer began searching, defendant did not pull away or appear confused. He did not say that he had not consented or tell the officer to stop the search. According to the officer, defendant was &quot;totally cooperative&quot; throughout the entire search. For example, when the officer felt objects in defendant's left pant leg, defendant explained what they were, voluntarily removed them and handed them to the officer. Nothing about defendant's statements, body language, or demeanor suggested that defendant &quot;did not want to be searched.&quot; Therefore, the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the workmen contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in adopting the calculations of the Division; in denying their motion to amend the pleadings; in not addressing the claims of certain workmen who were mischaracterized as apprentices; and in failing to award the workmen statutory doubling. The appellate court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the workmen's motion to amend as Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 55.33(b) did not apply and there was no relation back to the original pleadings. Therefore, the three-year statute of limitations barred adding the omitted workmen to the suit. However, the appellate court agreed with the workmen that the trial court erred in granting deference to the Division's report and placing the burden on the workmen to establish that the calculations contained in the Division's report were invalid. The trial court also erred in not doubling the underpaid wages pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 290.300 (2000) as the &quot;prevailing hourly rate of wages&quot; included amounts representing fringe benefit contributions and &sect; 290.300 required doubling of the difference between the amount paid and the &quot;prevailing hourly rate of wages.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to August 1998, a prosecuting attorney in the county was only a part-time position. The voters decided to make it full-time. The elected prosecuting attorney was subject to the retirement system. A dispute arose over what amount the county should have been paying under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 56.807 (Cum. Supp. 2005). Ultimately, the retirement system filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel payments. The trial court granted summary judgment against it, and this appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court held that the county was not required to pay the retirement system the amount owed by first class counties because this was only required under &sect; 56.807.5(3) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 56.363.3 (Cum. Supp. 2005) if the county had elected to make its prosecutor full-time and had elected that the prosecutor receive the same benefits as one in a first class county. Next, jurisdiction to hear the equal protection challenge to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 56.807 (Cum. Supp. 2005) was not vested exclusively with the Missouri Supreme Court since it depended on the construction of such. Because this issue was decisive, the trial court erred in not making a ruling.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 191.677 (2000) (Supp. 2002). The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) sentenced defendant as a persistent sexual offender to 10 years of imprisonment for each count, with the sentences to run concurrently.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two women alleged that defendant did not tell them that he was HIV-positive prior to engaging in sexual intercourse. An HIV counselor testified that defendant was HIV-positive. The appellate court declined to consider defendant's constitutional challenge to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 191.677.4 (2000) (Supp. 2002) because he did not preserve the argument for review since he raised the challenge for the first time on appeal. The appellate court determined that it had jurisdiction to consider defendant's challenges to the constitutionality of a jury instruction under U.S.  Const. amends. IV, V, VI, and XIV and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 10, 15, 18A, and 19-22(a) because his claims were not real and substantial, but merely colorable. The jury instruction, which did not allow the jury to consider condom use in determining recklessness, was constitutional because the instruction did not shift the burden of proof to defendant. Finally, the counselor's testimony qualified under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, and, even if the testimony was improper, it was not prejudicial, because defendant did not dispute the fact that he had HIV and the evidence was cumulative.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher had pleaded guilty to the crime of endangering the welfare of a child in the second degree, after she left her children in her car at a casino parking lot while she visited a friend. The Department contended that the Board correctly determined that endangering the welfare of a child in the second degree under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 568.050 necessarily involved moral turpitude. The court could not agree. In view of the fact that the Department had no plan to present evidence showing moral turpitude, the Board erred in denying the motion to dismiss. The charge to which the teacher pleaded guilty did not necessarily involve moral turpitude, and the Department never showed that the circumstances of the offense were such as to involve moral turpitude. Therefore, the hearing officer and the Board misapplied the law in concluding that a conviction of second-degree child endangerment was ipso facto a conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, creating authority for the Department to discipline a teaching certificate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the Board's discipline of the teacher's certificate. The court remanded for dismissal of the Department's complaint against the teacher.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Clay County, Missouri, ordered respondent County to rezone the trust property, and dismissed the trustees' other claims. The trustees appealed, and the County cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the trustees contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying their inverse condemnation claims. In its cross-appeal, the County raised 13 points, challenging, inter alia, the trial court's dismissal of its counterclaims seeking payment from the trustees for back due permit fees for buildings constructed on the trust property with permits. The appellate court found that the trustees abandoned their inverse condemnation claims as none of those claims were included in their first amended petition. Hence, there was no final and appealable judgment as to the trial court's dismissal of the trustees' initial petition for damages for inverse condemnation. Furthermore, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to review the County's decision denying the trustees' application for rezoning because they sought review by way of declaratory judgment rather than the statutorily mandated procedure set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.660. Hence, there was nothing for the appellate court to review, as to the merits, with respect to the trial court's judgment as to its judicial review of the decision of the County in refusing to rezone the trust property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the motion court erred in denying his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because counsel failed to brief a claim that the trial court plainly erred in accepting defendant's waiver of a jury trial in exchange for the State's waiver of the death penalty because, while defendant's appeal was pending, the Missouri Supreme Court decided a case which held that the State could not legally or constitutionally impose the death penalty on a defendant for crimes committed as a juvenile. Defendant argued that this case would have prevented the State from imposing the death penalty on him because he was 17 years old at the time he committed the crimes. The appellate court disagreed, finding that at the time defendant waived a jury trial, the death penalty could lawfully be imposed on a 17-year-old offender. Accordingly, defendant's waiver of a jury trial did not become involuntary, unknowing, or unintelligent because the law applicable at the time of the waiver was subsequently changed. Because defendant failed to show that reversal would have been required, he did not show ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) found that appellant father was in arrears in child support in excess of $ 10,000. The trial court ordered the father, in accordance with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.455.4 (2000), to post a bond of $ 10,000 within 30 days of the judgment or have his motion to modify dismissed. The father did not post the bond as ordered, and the trial court granted respondent mother's motion to dismiss. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.455.4 (2000) required the father to post the bond when seeking to modify a child custody decree. Because Count II of the father's motion dealt with custody and visitation modifications, the trial court did not err in dismissing that count because the father failed to file the bond required by &sect; 452.455.4. Due to the father's failure to file the bond, the trial court lacked any authority to proceed against the mother on Count II of his motion, requiring dismissal. However, in Count I, the father sought modification of child support which was not covered by &sect; 452.455.4; thus, dismissal for failure to file the bond was improper. Also, in Count III, the father sought a judgment against the mother for reimbursement of uncovered medical expenses, and, in Count IV, he sought an award of attorney's fees. Obviously, neither Count III nor Count IV sought a modification of custody, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.410 (2000), or of visitation, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.400.2 (2000). Accordingly, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.455.4 (2000) did not apply to those two counts, and the trial court erred in dismissing them as a bond was not required to pursue those counts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For the tax years 1991 through 1995, the taxpayer did not file Missouri income tax returns or pay any income tax to the State of Missouri. In 1999, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.611, the Director estimated the taxpayer's tax liability for those years and sent the taxpayer notices, via certified mail to her last known address. These notices were subsequently returned to the Director by the postal service as unclaimed. After the taxpayer failed to protest any of those assessments within sixty days from the date the proposed assessments were mailed to her, the amounts reflected in those proposed assessments were duly assessed against the taxpayer, and the Director issued notices to her demanding payment. After the taxpayer failed to pay the amounts that had been assessed by the Director, the Director filed a petition for delinquent tax. The taxpayer argued that the lack of actual notice unconstitutionally deprived her of the opportunity to challenge the amounts assessed by the Director. The appellate court ruled that the taxpayer raised issues regarding the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. &sect; 143.611 that were more than merely colorable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate entered a plea of guilty to six counts involving improper sexual contact with a child. After the inmate was sentenced, he filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct the judgment or sentence. The trial court held an evidentiary hearing, and corrected one discrepancy, but denied the inmate's motion in all other respects. The court held that it was not error for the plea court to fail to advise the inmate about the potential consequences under the SVPA because civil commitment under the SVPA was a collateral consequence of the inmate's guilty plea. The plea court did not have an obligation to advise the inmate of the collateral consequences of his plea. Similarly, the inmate did not have a valid argument for ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel allegedly failed to apprise the inmate about the possibility of future civil commitment under the SVPA. Counsel's failure to apprise the inmate of every collateral consequence of a guilty plea did not provide a sufficient basis to support a claim of ineffective assistance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of committing first-degree statutory sodomy and was sentenced to a term of 30 years in the department of corrections to run consecutive to a sentence he was already serving on a separate conviction. His conviction stemmed from actions upon his stepdaughter. On appeal, the court reversed, remanding for further proceedings. The court first held that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motion to dismiss because he was not tried within the statutory period set by the Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.450 et seq. (2000). Any additional delay in bringing defendant to trial was attributable to his illness. The court further held that reversal was appropriate because defendant's right to counsel was not properly waived; there was no indication that a written waiver was executed in accordance with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 600.051 (2000). There was also insufficient demonstration that defendant understood the ramifications of the waiver of his right to counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, granted judgment in favor of respondents, class representatives, and granted treble damages based on a finding that appellant bank engaged in the unauthorized business of law in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.010 (2000). The bank appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank argued that the trial court erred in overruling its motion for new trial because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 484.020 was unconstitutional in that it was a punitive statute yet required no culpable mental state. The appellate court noted that although the bank requested plain error review, no error existed affecting substantial rights or resulting in manifest injustice. The bank charged a separate document preparation fee for loan documentation. Because the bank charged a separate fee for creating deeds of trust and loan documentation, it engaged in a separate business detached from its mortgage lending, constituting the unauthorized business of law. This obviated the need to review the nature of, or context in which, the loan documentation was prepared. Possessing a financial stake in the outcome of a contract or loan did not defeat the fact that a non-lawyer charging a fee for document preparation constituted the unauthorized business of law. The voluntary payment doctrine was a principle based on waiver and consent, and the bank could not benefit from this defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court stated that it would affirm the trial court's judgment; however, in light of the general interest and importance of the issues involved, the appellate court transferred the case to the Missouri Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent phone company filed three tariff requests with respondent Missouri Public Service Commission. The phone company proposed a rebalancing of its tariffs. After making a decision, the Commission denied its public counsel's motion for rehearing, and appellant public counsel filed petitions for writ of review on the 2002 and 2003 rebalancing orders with the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri. The three cases were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was previously remanded. The phone company qualified for a price cap in 1999, and it rebalanced its rates during 2000. During 2001, it again wanted to rebalance its rates. While the initial rebalancing of rates case was moving through the courts, the Commission also approved tariffs that rebalanced the phone company's rates for two years. The petition for certiorari review was properly before the circuit court pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386.510 (2000). Further, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 (2000) was inapplicable because &sect; 386.510 was intended to be exclusive to any other procedure of review. Because the matter was an uncontested case, however, the appellate court previously erred when it held that findings of fact were needed. To the extent that prior case law required factual findings, the appellate court cautioned that the prior case should not be followed. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386.270 (2000) established that the legislature intended the orders of the Commission to remain in force and be prima facie lawful until found otherwise. Under these circumstances, the statutory presumption in favor of the phone company's rates authorized by the rebalancing tariffs remained in force.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Atchison County (Missouri), which convicted him of driving while intoxicated in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.010 (2000). Defendant was sentenced as a persistent alcohol offender pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.023 (2000). On appeal, defendant raised alleged instructional errors and he challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 577.023.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to his trial for driving while intoxicated, the State offered evidence of prior intoxication-related offenses as predicates for enhancement pursuant to &sect; 577.023. On appeal, the court first found that Mo. Approved Instructions Crim. No. 7 was not contrary to substantive law and was a mandated instruction for defendant's case. Furthermore, defendant could show no prejudice flowing from the giving of the instruction. Instruction 7 was a MAI-CR approved instruction; thus, the cautions of Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 28.02(d) did not apply. The court then determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's proffered instruction regarding sobriety tests. The trial court's refusal to &quot;privilege&quot; the defense by submitting the instruction to the jury was not so arbitrary and unreasonable as to shock the sense of justice nor did it indicate a lack of careful consideration. Finally, the court rejected defendant's equal protection challenge to &sect; 577.023 because the Missouri Supreme Court had already heard and rejected the argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent university was not a party in an earlier federal case. The university filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, requesting a declaration that tax incremental financing (TIF) ordinances did not violate Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8, and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The trial court granted summary judgment for the university and respondent city. Appellant association challenged the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university wished to build an arena for sports, graduation ceremonies, and other secular uses. The university sought the benefit of Missouri State Increment Financing under the Real Property Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 99.800 et seq. (2000). At issue on appeal was whether the university was controlled by a religious creed, church or sectarian denomination as referenced in the Missouri Constitution. The appellate court construed Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 8 to prohibit state aid only when an institution was controlled in such a way that religious authorities propagate and advance their religion through school operation. The university, although a university with a Jesuit tradition, was not a university &quot;controlled by a religious creed.&quot; That term was interpreted to mean those institutions that inculcate a doctrine and faith of a denomination, not those institutions that merely identify with a religious heritage. The appellate court found the city's grant of TIF funds to the university did not violate Establishment Clause principles of the Missouri Constitution. Nevertheless, the appellate court transferred the case pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 83.02.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which ordered that respondent employer be paid a portion of a settlement in its subrogation claim based on workers' compensation benefits paid to the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in a car accident. After receiving workers' compensation benefits in excess of $100,000, the employee filed a common law action against the driver of the other vehicle. The claim was settled for $100,000. The employer filed a subrogation claim, and it was awarded the balance of the settlement after attorney's fees. The employee then sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.150.3 (2000) was plain and unambiguous. Missouri courts used a certain method to apportion in this situation, which was set forth in the cases of Ruediger and Kerperien. The appellate court was bound to follow this precedent, despite the employee's assertion that it led to an illogical result. There was nothing in &sect;&nbsp;287.150.3 that showed that the legislature did not contemplate that an employee would recover less from the third party than the employer paid in workers' compensation benefits. Finally, the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 287.150 was not properly before the appellate court because it was not raised in the answer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed village was composed of a &quot;little over 700 acres.&quot; The six or seven buildings and the 700 acres of the proposed village were all owned by the same corporation. The proposed village was occupied by only seven or eight full-time residents, one or more part-time residents, and occasional visitors. At the time of the hearing, respondents had lived in the proposed village for only about six months. The court analyzed the legislative intent in Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 72. The court determined, utilizing the plain and ordinary meaning of Mo. Rev.

The court determined that the trial court erred as a matter of law in approving respondents' petition to incorporate the proposed village utilizing the provisions of &sect; 72.080.1.

Defendant did not argue that he was unable to properly prepare a defense or that he was otherwise prejudiced by the indictment. The trial court properly prohibited defendant from asking the venire panel members if they understood or could identify the victim in the case. The question was irrelevant to the issues in the case and may have misled the venire panel members to instead consider policy issues surrounding the law.

The issue on appeal was whether the petition arose from an uncontested or contested case within the meaning of the Missouri Administrative Procedure Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.010 et seq. (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sought judicial review of the termination of his employment with respondent county as an uncontested case pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 (2000). The trial court, however, treated the matter as a contested case. On appeal, the employee contended, in part, that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition for review because the time limitation in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.110.1 (2000) for contested cases did not apply. The court stated that the employee had a constitutional due process right to a hearing because he could only be terminated for cause pursuant to a union resolution. Thus, the employer was required to hold a hearing before terminating the employee. The &quot;hearing&quot; which the employee had, however, did not determine the his legal right to continued employment and an administrator retained the final decision-making authority. Because the &quot;hearing&quot; did not determine the employee's legal right to continued employment, there was no contested case, as defined in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.010(2) (2000), subject to the &sect; 536.110.1 time limitations. Thus, the trial court erred in dismissing the employee's petition for review for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for sexually abusing his five-year-old daughter. During his trial, the trial court admitted into evidence the daughter's videotaped deposition in lieu of live testimony under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.680; defendant was not present during the deposition under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.685 because the trial court found that significant emotional or psychological trauma would result to the daughter if defendant was present. On appeal, the court held that because defendant had the right to cross-examine his daughter during her videotaped deposition through his attorney, he was not denied his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him, even though he was not present. The trial court did not plainly err by failing to sua sponte declare a mistrial based on statements the prosecutor made during closing arguments because the statements did not constitute misconduct. The prosecutor did not ask the jury to put themselves in the victim's shoes but rather asked the jurors to compare their sexual knowledge at five in order to determine whether the daughter had advanced sexual knowledge for her age.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Firemen's Retirement System (FRS) sued appellants, the City and city officers, arguing that the City was obligated under Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 87 (2000) and St. Louis, Mo., City Code ch. 4.18 to appropriate the amount of the City's contribution to the FRS as certified by the actuary and the FRS Board of Trustees. The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, ruled in favor of the FRS. The City and the officers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the City and the officers contended the trial court erred in finding that the City and the officers waived the issue of standing under the Hancock Amendment, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 16-24, in not permitting them to amend their pleadings, and in interpreting and applying the relevant statutes and ordinances. The appellate court found that because the City and the officers, who were acting in their official capacities, were not taxpayers, they lacked standing to raise the Hancock Amendment as an affirmative defense. And as the City and the officers did not have standing to raise the Hancock Amendment as an affirmative defense, denying them leave to amend did not result in any hardship to them. Further, an examination of the other factors that the trial court considered in determining whether to grant leave to amend showed that it did not abuse its discretion on this issue. Finally, the enabling act and the ordinances of the City that required the City to pay to the FRS the amounts certified by an actuary and the FRS Board of Trustees were not an improper delegation of legislative power to the Board, and did not violate Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 26(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was transferred to the Missouri Supreme Court for further interpretation of the enabling statutes and ordinances at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, granted partial summary judgment in favor of respondents, individual members of the Board of Trustees of the Police Retirement System of the City of St. Louis (PRS), with respect to their allegations that appellant city failed to appropriate and transfer the amount owed to PRS for the fiscal year. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city argued that the trial court erred in requiring the city to pay the amount the PRS claimed was due because requiring payment of the certified amount violated the Hancock Amendment's, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 21, prohibition against State-required increases in the expenditures of other political subdivisions beyond the 1981 funding level without a corresponding appropriation by the State to fund such an increase. The appellate court found that the city lacked standing to raise the Hancock Amendment as a defense as the city was not a taxpayer. Because the city failed to assert Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 86.810 (2000) as a basis for standing in its written pleadings, motions, responses, and replies and the trial court likewise issued no ruling on the matter either in its judgment or post-judgment determinations, the city failed to preserve the effect of &sect; 86.810 for appellate review. The statutory scheme that required the city to pay the certified amount to the PRS was neither an improper delegation of legislative power nor a violation of Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 26(a). The statutory scheme mandated payment of the actuarially certified amount to ensure that the PRS remained actuarially sound.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to noise complaints and the act of an employee obstructing a police officer, the city revoked a liquor license held by the business under Independence, Mo., Code &sect;&sect; 2.06.002.A, 2.11.001. The circuit court affirmed, and the business sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that, because neither ordinance cited by the business &quot;required&quot; a hearing, the business was not entitled to a contested hearing subject to judicial review by the circuit court in accordance with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.140 (2000). Hence, the circuit court did not err in conducting a noncontested review under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 (2000). Next, the appellate court rejected the assertion that Independence, Mo., Code &sect; 2.06.002.B was violative of due process; it did not shift the burden of proof from the city to the licensee. It merely required that a liquor license officer give the business notice of the hearing to allow it to defend itself. Finally, although the issue was not briefed in accordance with Mo. R. Civ. P. 84.04 (2005), the appellate court considered and rejected the argument that there was insufficient evidence to support the revocation based on the stated grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The official was a duly elected alderman representing the 24th ward of the City of St. Louis, Missouri. A petition seeking a recall election to remove the official from office was filed. The official subsequently filed a petition for declaratory and injunctive relief, requesting relief predicated upon a constitutional attack on the Charter of the City of St. Louis, which provided for the recall of elective officers. The appellate court ruled that it had no jurisdiction except to reverse the judgment and remand the cause for dismissal because the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over the action. The official failed to join the City of St. Louis an indispensable party to his constitutional attack on the Charter of the City of St. Louis, thus, the circuit court's judgment was entered without jurisdiction and was void. The City of St. Louis had an obvious interest in any judicial declaration regarding its charter, rendering it an indispensable party to the circuit-court proceeding. The presence of an indispensable party was a jurisdictional requirement. The failure to join the City of St. Louis as a party to the circuit-court proceeding was fatal to that court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The driver had alleged that the Director failed to prove all the elements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.060(9) (2000) in denying his license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver met his initial burden of production to show that he had a duly issued license. Thus, the court proceeded to a discussion of whether the records produced by the Director met her burden of producing evidence that the driver was not qualified for a driver's license. The court decided that the Director did meet that burden by introducing the driver's driving record, letters denying and revoking his license, and two uniform complaint and summons forms that reflected the driver's two DWI convictions. At this point, the burden of production shifted back to the driver to illustrate that the facts purported to be established by the administrative record were not true or that the grounds for suspension were unlawful, unconstitutional, or otherwise insufficient under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 (2000). To meet his burden of production, the driver could have testified that he was not counseled at the municipal court hearing or he could have provided documentation that refuted the record provided by the Director. The driver did not meet that burden of production or persuasion. Therefore, the Director's evidence was uncontroverted and reversal of the Director's decision was in error.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, entered a judgment dismissing her petition for failure to state a claim. The circuit court also held that Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died in a motor vehicle accident after consuming a 12-pack of beer. The mother challenged the validity of Missouri's dram-shop law. The appellate court noted that this issue would appear to be within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction. The record indicated the mother properly raised and preserved for appellate review the issue of the validity of the dram-shop law. Moreover, the challenge was based on constitutional issues the mother raised before the circuit court. The intermediate appellate court next concluded that the mother's claim was real and substantial, such that the supreme court would consider the appeal. The matter fell within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court. Moreover, when the supreme court had exclusive appellate jurisdiction over one of the issues in a case, its jurisdiction extends to all of the issues. Consequently, the intermediate appellate court lacked jurisdiction, under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

The deed of release was mailed on February 9, 2004 to the St. Louis County Recorder's Office and was recorded on February 17, 2004. The court held that the mortgagor's letter met the requirements of &sect; 443.130 because a previous case held that the letter was not required to reference &sect; 43.130 specifically. Also the &quot;official check&quot; for the full amount to satisfy the mortgage was received by the bank on December 3, 2003 and deposited into its bank account on December 4, 2003. Furthermore, the bank's account record showed that the deed of trust was satisfied on December 3, 2003. Finally, the court noted that the Missouri Supreme Court had determined in another case that the bank's constitutional arguments regarding &sect; 443.130 were &quot;not real or substantial.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of two counts of sexual misconduct involving a child in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;566.083.1(1) (2000) on February 24, 2005, and was sentenced on April 22, 2005.

The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction as defendant could not be convicted under a statute that was unconstitutional as the conviction was illegal and void. The appellate court noted that the supreme court's ruling in holding Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Division of Workers' Compensation of the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, sought review of a writ of mandamus issued by the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), ordering the Division to consider certain medical fee dispute applications filed with it by respondent health care provider. At issue was a dispute over the operation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.140 (2000) and Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 50-2.030.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Division rejected numerous medical fee dispute applications filed by the provider without a hearing or notice. The provider argued that the Division had a ministerial duty to accept and adjudicate all its applications without regard to whether the underlying workers' compensation case was open or closed. On appeal, the court agreed with the provider, finding that Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 8, &sect;&sect; 50-2.030(1)(O) and 50-2.030(2)(I) did not fairly carry out the mandate of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.140 but instead arbitrarily and impermissibly cut off jurisdiction when the workers' compensation case was closed. The court found that while the Division's interest in providing finality to injured employees, employers, and their insurers was legitimate, it could not advance that interest at the expense of a health care provider's right to have its day in court. In addition, due process required that in the face of the provider's deprivation of property, which was their accounts receivable, they were entitled to receive notice and an opportunity for hearing. Thus, the Division had a statutory duty to permit the filing of the medical fee dispute applications by the provider under &sect; 287.140.4.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Clay County (Missouri), which ordered her to pay delinquent taxes, additions to tax, and interest. The taxpayer claimed that the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss, because the lack of actual notice unconstitutionally deprived her of the opportunity to challenge the amounts assessed by respondent, the Director of Revenue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For several years, the taxpayer did not file Missouri income tax returns or pay any income tax to respondent, the State of Missouri. The Director of Revenue estimated the taxpayer's tax liability for those years based upon federal income tax records and sent the taxpayer notices, via certified mail to her last known address, informing her of the amount of deficiency proposed. The taxpayer conceded that the Director's mailing of the notices via certified mail complied with the relevant statutory provisions, but argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 143.611.3, allowing for notice by certified or registered mail, was unconstitutional. The court first determined that the taxpayer's constitutional claims were merely colorable and did not invoke the Missouri Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction. The court next noted that mail service was an inexpensive and efficient mechanism that was reasonably calculated to provide actual notice and was sufficient, in the taxpayer's situation, to satisfy the notice requirement of due process. The taxpayer's claim that actual notice was always required to satisfy due process was clearly contrary to existing case law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of its quest to build and operate a casino, the casino applied to the Commission for approval of the site of the gambling facility, approval of historical design elements of the proposed facility, and approval of continuous docking of the facility. The Commission approved the proposed site. The claimants challenged the Commission's decision, and respondents argued that the claimants lacked standing to challenge the Commission's decision. The appellate court ruled that the claimants did not have a sufficient interest in the Commission's decision to give them standing as a landowner, competitor, or taxpayer to challenge the decision. The claimants failed to identify a direct expenditure of state funds resulting from the decision issued by the Commission that could possibly be deemed to be illegal. Also, appellants failed to sufficiently establish that one claimant had standing to challenge the ruling as a nearby property owner. Appellants failed to aver that the Commission's decision had any adverse impact on the claimant's property or that the claimant otherwise had any legally cognizable interest in the decision distinct from the interest of the general public.</SPAN></P>

The residents opposed the redevelopment project and sought to have the zoning decision set aside by placing the matter before the voters through a referendum in accordance with the city charter. The charter, however, prohibited the use of referendum for an amendment to the zoning ordinance. In addition, the court found that, contrary to the residents' assertion, Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 52(a), did not grant an unlimited right to referendum. Thus, the trial court properly dismissed the residents' claim for declaratory judgment. The court also found that the residents' request for mandamus was properly denied because under the city charter, the city clerk could not take any action with respect to the referendum petition. The court next determined that the trial court properly made its decision to dismiss the residents' petition based on the information contained in the pleadings. The people of the city voted for a charter that prohibited the use of referendum for amendments to the zoning ordinance, and the prohibition was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer ordered defendant out of the car, told him he was under arrest for driving while suspended, handcuffed him, and put him in the patrol car. The officer then searched defendant's car and found what he thought was cocaine. At the police station, defendant attempted to grab the cocaine and flush it down the toilet. He assaulted officers as they tried to refrain him from doing so. The trial court eventually suppressed the evidence of cocaine. Defendant then filed a motion for judgment of acquittal, for a new trial, or for an order setting aside the verdict on the tampering charge, claiming that because the drugs were ultimately suppressed, the State could not make a submissible case that defendant had tampered or attempted to tamper with that evidence. The circuit court denied the motion. On appeal, the court first found that defendant's arrest alone justified the search of his car and that the drugs seized during that search were properly admitted into evidence at defendant's trial. Because the search was valid, the premise of defendant's argument for why his motions for judgment of acquittal should have been granted failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer purchased land owned by the seller. The buyer paid the real property tax on the seller's property for two years in which the seller should have paid the taxes. The buyer contended that the seller knew or should have known that it owed the taxes for those years. On appeal, the court first found that the trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031.5 was not the exclusive method for a party claiming unjust enrichment, and the buyer did not need to exhaust administrative remedies that were not applicable to its claim. The court also determined that the buyer's amended petition stated a recognizable claim for relief, and the trial court did not err in submitting certain instructions to the jury or in failing to submit other instructions. The court noted that the buyer's action was a recognized private cause of action for unjust enrichment and that it had jurisdiction to address the claim. Finally, with respect to the seller's counterclaim, the court determined that there was no evidence of intent on the part of the buyer to interfere with the seller's relationship with the county or to injure the seller, and none could reasonably be inferred.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. The trial court awarded the grandmother two separate two week periods during the summer months of June, July, and August of each and every year. The trial court also found that she should have two one-week periods of visitation when the child was not in school. Additionally, the trial court's judgment stated that &quot;on such occasions when the grandmother is in the State of Missouri she shall be allowed to have a visitation period with the child for so long as she provides the father seven days advance notice and that said period of visitation shall not interfere with the child's school attendance nor holidays.&quot; Finally, the judgment stated that the original provisions relating to visitation, as set out in the judgment of paternity, remained in effect so the judgment still provided that the grandmother could exercise visitation awarded to the child's mother, if the mother did not exercise that visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment modifying visitation between the child and the grandmother was reversed and the case was remanded for entry of more restrictive visitation for the grandmother.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of New Madrid County (Missouri), which denied his motion for DNA testing pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 547.035 (2000). He had been convicted of capital murder and his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant was convicted of shooting and killing a man following a fight outside a tavern. Movant's principal defense at trial was that he was in an intoxicated and drugged condition that prevented him from acting knowingly or purposely at the time of the shooting. The murder weapon was taken from movant and he was arrested at the scene of the crime. Movant did not, and could not, allege facts to warrant relief under &sect; 547.035.4 in that identity was not an issue at trial, nor was it an issue on appeal of the denial of his motion. At trial, movant did not contest the fact that he shot the victim.  Additionally, although movant alleged that almost every item of evidence should have been tested for DNA, he failed to allege how any of that evidence, if tested, would exonerate him. A defendant was not entitled to DNA testing when he failed to explain that fact. In addition, the court noted that movant failed to plead facts necessary to entitle him to a hearing under &sect; 547.035.6. Finally, because movant did not raise the issue of the constitutional validity of &sect; 547.035 until the instant appeal and the trial court did not rule on that issue, the issue was not properly preserved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant buyer challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Platte County, Missouri that dismissed County III of his complaint that alleged respondent seller bank violated Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 407.020.1 of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act (MPA), by failing to disclose at the time of sale that the EPA was involved with the property. The bank cross-appealed an adverse judgment as to Count II of the buyer's complaint that alleged fraud.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer was unaware of the EPA's involvement due to a prior owner's dumping of hazardous waste and paint cans. The EPA required the buyer to remove the cans, and the buyer filed suit against the bank for failing to disclose the EPA's involvement. On appeal, the buyer claimed the trial court erred in dismissing his MPA claim. The court found that the trial court should have retrospectively applied the amended version of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 407.025.1, which authorized a private cause of action for nondisclosure and provided for punitive damages, because it was procedural and remedial. The court noted that the amended version applied to &quot;merchandise,&quot; which included real estate as defined in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 407.010(4) (2000), and did not unconstitutionally impose any new obligations because the bank was already subject to penalties for violations of the MPA under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 407.100, 407.130, and 407.140. The court also held that the theories of recovery of fraud and the MPA violation were not inconsistent; therefore the buyer was not required to make an election of remedies between them. However, the court noted that the buyer was not entitled to double recovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of trial court judgment that awarded the buyer actual damages and denied punitive damages on the buyer's common law fraud claim, but reversed the trial court's dismissal of the buyer's MPA claim. The court remanded for trial on the MPA claim on the issue of damages only, both actual and punitive, and to determine attorney's fees and the extent to which the awards on both claims would merge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the city council enacted ordinances to rezone two large tracts from agricultural use to residential planned unit development, appellant property owners filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the council acted arbitrarily and capriciously in enacting the rezoning ordinances. The Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, declared that the council acted lawfully. The owners appealed and respondent city cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the owners challenged the trial court's finding that the city council acted lawfully in enacting the ordinance. Considering that traffic from the property to be developed would empty onto the roads abutting the owners' properties and that the owners alleged the traffic would create congested and dangerous conditions, the appellate court found that the development stood to impact the owners adversely and more distinctly than the community in general; this was sufficient to establish standing, contrary to the city's contention. While the trial court erred in assuming that the city's planner's rejection of the comprehensive plan's method for calculating holding capacities was improper, the appellate court found that the owners were not harmed by the error as any changes in policy as expressed in the comprehensive plan had to be accomplished by official action. Further, the owners failed to show that the council's rezoning decisions were not reasonable. Although the owners presented evidence of private detriment, sufficient evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that public benefit significantly outweighed the detriment.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined that a justiciable controversy existed; therefore the circuit court did not err in denying the coalition's motion to dismiss. The circuit court had found that the proposition operated prospectively. The appellate court agreed that the proposition did not impact the provisions of the ordinance, cooperation agreement, project agreement, or the bonds. Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 26 did not apply to the bonds at issue in the present case regardless of whether the county's obligation could be considered debt. The financing agreement in the instant case did not result in a debt incurred by the county longer than 20 years. Further, the county's agreement did not violate Mo. Const. art.

The Commission was also free to believe or disbelieve the testimony presented. The Commission was not bound by the national average, and the utility had no right to a profit. The methodology employed by the Commission was also just and reasonable since its objective was to protect the customers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that the prosecutor vindictively brought the charge against him in violation of his due process rights. The court reluctantly reversed on appeal, stating that the facts of the case presented a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness. Thus, the court was required to apply the presumption of vindictiveness. Further, the State failed to rebut the presumption with objective evidence. Defendant had alleged that the prosecutor acted vindictively when he raised the charge from possession of a controlled substance to possession with the intent to distribute after the trial court sustained his motion for a mistrial during voir dire. The court searched the record and was unable to find any plausible, non-vindictive reason for the new charge that was filed. Additionally, there was nothing suggesting that the prosecutor was unaware of the facts necessary to bring the higher charge before the trial began. His double jeopardy rights were not violated because he was never in jeopardy on the original charge since the mistrial was granted during jury selection.</SPAN></P>

Respondent taxpayer was awarded refunds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed the tax rate levies for 2002 were in violation of a 1999 judgment that held the 1998 tax rates were unlawful and unconstitutional based upon an improper &quot;rounding up&quot; formula used in the calculations and the Hancock Amendment and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073, which required voter approval for higher rates and that the county failed to adjust the 2002 tax rates for the sales tax revenue as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.505.3(6) (2000). The county claimed the taxpayer's petition was untimely. The court held that the taxpayer's action was timely because he was not seeking a refund of taxes for 2000 or 2001 but was seeking a refund for the 2002 taxes that were collected based on improper calculations from prior years. The court held that the county's tax rate levies for 2002 were incorrect because the county had applied the unconstitutional 1998 tax rates, which resulted in improper tax rate ceilings for the years 2000, 2001, and 2002, and resulted in unlawful 2002 tax rates for general revenue and road and bridge purposes. The court rejected the county's claim that it was not required by &sect; 67.505.3(6) to adjust its tax rates for actual sales tax collections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) granted summary judgment in favor of respondent mortgagors on causes of action for penalties for failure to provide a deed of release and attorney's fees under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 443.130 (2000), for invasion of privacy/unreasonable publicity of another's private life, for interference with prospective advantage, and for punitive damages. Appellant mortgagee sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagors sent a letter to the mortgagee, which requested a deed of release, included evidence that the deed of trust had been satisfied, and enclosed a check for recording fees. The letter did not reference any statute, did not request the issuance of a deed of release within a certain period of time, did not specify to whom the deed of release should be sent, and did not reference any penalties for failure to provide the deed of release within a certain period of time. On appeal, the mortgagee argued successfully that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the mortgagors because the demand letter failed to follow the requirements of &sect; 443.130. The letter did not reference &sect; 443.130 and did not request a deed of release within 15 business days. In addition, the letter only requested that the mortgagee deliver the requested deed of release promptly, without stating to whom the release should be sent. Nothing in the text of the letter was sufficient to place the mortgagee on proper notice that a statutory demand for the deed of release was being made. The mortgagors, therefore, were precluded from collecting the penalties provided under &sect; 443.130.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company bought property in the city, and the city's refuse collection ordinances authorized the imposition of a special tax bill to act as a lien on property if refuse collection fees were not paid.

The company paid some portion of the balance on those tax bills, and then sought a declaration that the ordinances were unconstitutional and unlawful, and that the taxes were collected mistakenly or erroneously and sought a refund under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031.5(2000). The appellate court affirmed the grant of the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim because (1) the company failed to show that requesting a refund under Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's sole point on appeal was that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance when he failed to move for disqualification of the prosecutor, under Mo.

The prosecutor knew one of the victims' mothers because they worked in the same building; the prosecutor also testified that he knew who the victims were from working with the mother. In addition, the inmate claimed that the prosecutor refused to offer a plea bargain because the victims did not want it, called the victims by name during trial, and at one point, in frustration, cried and threw exhibits across the floor. The prosecutor denied the latter claims. The appellate court rejected defendant's claim that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because it held that the prosecutor would not have been disqualified under &sect; 56.110 as the prosecutor only casually knew the victims. Moreover, the inmate failed to prove that a different prosecutor would have resulted in a different result; thus, there was no prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court suppressed marijuana seized during a search of a vehicle in which defendant was a passenger and the incriminating statements defendant made subsequent to the seizure. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not err in suppressing the marijuana because the trial court's determination that no probable cause existed for the search of the vehicle was supported by substantial evidence. The court further found that the trial court did not err in suppressing defendant's re-Miranda statements because he was not provided with his Miranda warnings prior to a custodial interrogation. Because of the circumstances under which defendant was questioned after being provided his Miranda warnings, the court found that his post-Miranda statements were also properly suppressed. The trial court did err, however, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, in suppressing the statements made by defendant while in the back seat of the patrol car, because defendant had no reasonable or legitimate expectation of privacy in the back seat of a patrol car.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant failed to raise the argument that &sect; 575.150 was unconstitutional in the trial court. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient for a jury to conclude that defendant resisted arrest by using physical force by holding onto the steering wheel when the officers tried to get her out of the car and that what the jury were required to find in order to convict defendant was whether defendant resisted arrest by &quot;using violence or physical force,&quot; not whether she did so by refusing to hand her license to the officers. There was no question that defendant knew that the officers were arresting her, and further, the validity of that arrest did not determine whether she was entitled to resist that exercise of authority.

Ultimately, the trooper shot the man in the hand to keep him from pulling the trigger. As a result of his actions, the trooper was suspended for eight hours. The suspension was reversed on appeal, and an appeal was filed. In reversing, the court reviewed the case under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150.1 (2000). Under this standard of review, the court was not allowed to substitute its judgment for that legally vested in an administrative officer. The court noted that the trooper did not violate Mo. St. High. Patrol Gen. Ord. 01-04-0897, which set forth the guidelines for the use of deadly force. However, the trial court erred by finding that a suspension could not have been ordered if the shooting was justifiable and the general order was not violated. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43.150 (2000), the trooper could have been suspended for less than three days at the discretion of a superintendent without a hearing. The trial court should have focused on whether a suspension was appropriate under the facts, which showed that the trooper exercised poor judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee's employment was terminated for cause. After review of respondent city's personnel board's recommendation, the city manager upheld the employment termination and notified the former employee of his right to pursue arbitration. The former employee timely filed for arbitration of his grievance, but prior to the arbitration hearing, he also filed a petition for judicial review. On appeal, the former employee argued that the trial court erred in determining that he failed to exhaust all administrative remedies under the city's personnel code. The appellate court noted that exhaustion of administrative remedies was a jurisdictional requirement for judicial review under the Missouri Administrative Procedure Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.100 (2000). The appellate court held that when exhaustion was required and a party failed to pursue all administrative remedies, a trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction and the only recourse was to dismiss the cause. The appellate court concluded that as the former employee failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the city's grievance procedure, the denial of his petition for review was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a request for declaratory judgment, seeking to have the inmate classification policies of the Missouri Department of Corrections (MDOC) declared unconstitutional. The inmate filed a request to proceed in forma pauperis. Respondent Director answered. The Circuit Court of Randolph County, Missouri, denied the requested relief. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's classification began at a level 5, and it dropped to a level 4 over the years. The MDOC then revised its classification policies. Under the new classification system, the inmate's classification score was reclassified from a level 4 to 5. Under a grandfather provision, the inmate was eligible to be reclassified from a level 5 to a level 4 offender. The correctional facility in which the inmate was housed was reclassified from a level 4 to a level 3. Under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 81.04, the inmate's notice was timely because there was an intervening holiday, and because he did all he could, despite his indigency, to timely file the notice. The inmate claimed that MDOC should not be permitted, under the new classification system, to transfer him to a high security institution; however, the state had the authority to place him in any institution. Finally, the inmate maintained that the trial court erred in holding, under the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), that he was required pay the full filing fee. Despite this argument, the trial court properly ordered that funds be withdrawn from his correctional center account, pursuant to the PLRA, until the fees were paid in full.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was involved in a motor vehicle accident. When officers arrived, the driver smelled of alcohol, his eyes were bloodshot and dilated, and his speech was slurred. The driver refused to give consent for a blood sample. However, an officer at the scene directed paramedics to take the sample anyway. The sample showed that the driver's blood alcohol content was over 0.08 percent. The driver sought review after the Director's decision to revoke his license for one year was upheld by the trial court. In reversing, the court determined that the results of the blood test were not admissible in the proceeding under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.505 (Cum. Supp. 2004). The court noted that, while the exclusionary rule did not apply to such proceedings, this was not the issue in the case. The driver was not challenging the decision based on a violation of constitutional rights, but on statutory interpretation. The driver had the right to refuse the test under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.041 (Cum. Supp. 2004). The evidence was only admissible under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.037.4 (Cum. Supp. 2004) if the procedures in Mo. Rev.

The Circuit Court of Pemiscot County (Missouri) found, inter alia, that there was not a substantial change in the circumstances of the child or of his custodial parent sufficient to warrant modification of custody nor was there a substantial change of circumstances so as to make the terms of the original child support award unreasonable. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Substantial evidence supported the trial court's finding that there was no change of circumstances warranting a change of custody because (1) any moves made by appellee mother were approved by the father and even encouraged on several occasions; (2) the moves were made in good faith and had no impact on the ability of the father to exercise his periods of temporary custody and visitation; (3) the mother did provide a stable environment for the child; (4) the claim that the child was about to commence school had never been a ground to modify custody in and of itself; and (5) the father did not provide evidence of any medical or dental neglect. However, due to the change in the child's school schedule, the trial court proper set forth a more specific visitation and temporary custody plan. In addition, the father did not factually prove a decrease in his income or a decline in his overall financial standing nor did he establish a prima facie showing pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.370. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the father's request to reduce his child support payments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the mother argued that the trial court erroneously applied the law in failing to dismiss the step-grandfather from the case because he had no statutory right in Missouri to intervene in a dissolution proceeding and no statutory right to visitation with a step-child. Thus, the mother contended that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to allow the step-grandfather to remain in the case. The appellate court agreed with the mother that the original intervention and award of grandparent visitation to the step-grandfather was not authorized under the grandparent visitation statute, and that the motion court could have granted the mother's motions to dismiss as a matter of law; however, because she did not object to the step-grandfather's intervention in the original dissolution proceeding and did not appeal the original judgment that granted him visitation rights, the matter was fully and finally adjudicated, and the mother was barred from seeking to have the step-grandfather dismissed on grounds of res judicata. Further, the trial court specifically found that visitation with the step-grandfather was in the child's best interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city charged appellant railway and historical society with nine violations of the city zoning ordinances related to the society's operation of its tourist excursion railroad. The Circuit Court of Cass County, Missouri, overruled the society's motion to dismiss. The society was found guilty of all nine violations and fined. The society appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the society contended the trial court erred in finding it guilty of violating the city's ordinances on several grounds. The appellate court disagreed, finding that in its operation as a tourist excursion railroad that ran exclusively on five miles of track, the society was not part of the &quot;interstate rail network&quot; under 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 10501(a)(2)(A) of the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (ICCTA). As the society offered rides for amusement rather than providing transportation between destinations, it was not in the transportation business and was not a part of the interstate rail network for which the ICCTA preempted local ordinances. Under the plain language of the zoning ordinance, use of the tracks for freight car storage was a nonconforming use that was discontinued for a period of at least 12 months. Thus, the society's use and occupancy of the tracks had to comply with the regulations of the zoning district. Although Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 94.270 (2000) did not allow fourth-class cities to regulate railroads, the society had an occupational license to operate as a museum and, therefore, had to comply with the city's occupation license ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a concealable-firearm permit. In the application, he conceded that he had received a bad conduct discharge from the military, but denied any felony convictions. The sheriff denied the application. In the trial court, the sheriff served the applicant with interrogatories and requests for production and admissions. The sheriff sought information regarding any of the applicant's criminal convictions and his military discharge. The trial court denied the sheriff's motion to compel, ruling that the discovery violated Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 because it was an effort to question the applicant's right to keep and bear arms. The trial court awarded judgment to the applicant. On appeal, the court found that the applicant's interpretation of the Missouri concealable-firearm permit statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev.

The city alleged that it had acquired ownership of each piece of property through adverse possession because it had openly, notoriously and adversely occupied and used these four tracts of land since 1951 as part of the municipal airport. The property owners moved to dismiss the city's petition on the ground that quieting title to the disputed tracts of land in the city, through adverse possession, would be an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; without just compensation. The trial denied the motion and quieted title to the parcels in favor of the city. The appellate court affirmed and held that (1) public entities could acquire real property by adverse possession if the entity complied with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.010, (2) the city's acquisition of private property by adverse possession extinguished the property owners' right to just compensation, and (3) the property owners could not bring a claim for inverse condemnation because they did not do so before the expiration of the ten-year statute of limitations for adverse possession established by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.010.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Circuit Court of Iron County (Missouri) on two counts of possession of a controlled substance in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.202 (2000). The information had been amended to allege that defendant was a prior and persistent drug offender and that the offenses could be treated as class A felonies for purposes of sentencing pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 195.275 and 195.285. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's first point, he argued that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress because seizure of the foil packet was not justified as part of the traffic stop, the investigative stop to determine whether defendant was driving while intoxicated, or pursuant to the plain view doctrine. The appellate court held that the foil was properly seized by police pursuant to the plain view doctrine. Once the deputy observed the beer bottle in the van, it was permissible to extend the traffic stop to investigate whether defendant had been drinking and driving. Defendant was asked to exit his vehicle as a part of that new investigation. While doing so, the foil fell from the van, where it was plainly visible to the corporal until defendant placed his foot on it. Seizure of the foil without a warrant was proper because it was in plain view. Both officers recognized the foil packet as a type of drug paraphernalia commonly used to smoke methamphetamine. Their knowledge of how methamphetamine was ingested was a relevant consideration in determining the incriminating character of the foil. Defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the foil even after it fell from the van.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed and the case was remanded to the trial court to enter an amended written judgment reflecting the judgment and sentences as they were announced by the trial judge in open court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by failing to give his requested lesser-included offense instruction on involuntary manslaughter. The court of appeals disagreed. The trial court properly refused to give an involuntary manslaughter instruction because there was no evidentiary basis upon which the jury reasonably could have acquitted defendant of second degree murder. Even viewed favorably to defendant, the evidence showed that he acted knowingly in killing the victim. Defendant's statement to an officer confirmed that defendant intentionally hit the victim in the head with a hammer. The blow was so powerful that it cracked his skull around its entire circumference, and it pushed large fragments of bone into his brain. The claw of the hammer penetrated two inches into the victim's brain, causing destruction of brain tissue and extensive hemorrhaging. Death was practically certain to result from such a blow. In sum, defendant intentionally used a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim's body to inflict a fatal injury. Those facts were sufficient to permit a finding of intent to kill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the State of Missouri, filed an action to commit appellant to the custody of the Department of Mental Health as a sexually violent predator. The State did not call appellant as a witness, and he did not testify at trial. During its closing argument, the State attempted to disparage appellant's claim that he had changed. The State commented on appellant's failure to testify and insinuated to the jurors that as a result of his failure to testify they could draw an adverse inference regarding whether he had changed. The jury found appellant to be a sexually violent predator. Appellant argued that because persons committed under the general civil commitment law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.335.2(4) (2000), had the right to remain silent, application of equal protection compelled the appellate court to find that sexually violent predators possessed that same right. The appellate court ruled that appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of the sexually violent predator law was real and substantial, not merely colorable, and that the Missouri Supreme Court had exclusive jurisdiction to pass on the constitutional question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer filed his real property tax bills under protest. He brought an action under Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 23 against appellees, a county and a library, alleging all taxpayers were entitled to an adjudication concerning their entitlement to a refund of taxes that violated the Hancock Amendment, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 23. The Circuit Court of Franklin County (Missouri) granted the library's motion to dismiss. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the taxpayer argued that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073.8 did not govern the relief the taxpayer sought under Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 23. The question was whether, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.073.8, the failure to file a complaint with the prosecutor before initiating an action seeking a refund was fatal to the action under the Hancock Amendment. The appellate court found that because &sect; 137.073.8 determined the manner in which the taxpayer could challenge the tax rate when seeking a refund, the question was a procedural one of timeliness and found that &sect; 137.073.8's use of the word &quot;may&quot; in describing when a taxpayer could bring a suit indicated that it was not mandatory that a taxpayer challenge the taxing authorities' alleged non-compliance. But, the taxpayer chose to challenge the taxing authority and so he had to first file a complaint with the prosecutor and only after the prosecutor failed to act on the complaint could he institute an action as representative of a class of all taxpayers. The trial court did not err in finding that the suit, in so far as it sought a refund of excess taxes paid, was procedurally barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part. The trial court's dismissal was reversed and the taxpayer was allowed to proceed on his claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Crawford County (Missouri) determined the paternity custody, support of, and visitation with the parties' child. Petitioner father appealed from the visitation and support awards included in the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father incorrectly argued that respondent mother had to first exhaust administrative remedies afforded by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.475.5 in order to be entitled to seek a change, or modification, of the terms of an administrative order regarding the award of child support. Additionally, in determining child support, the trial court's failure to impute income to the mother was not an abuse of discretion because (1) she was 18 years old when she met the father and became pregnant; (2) there was no evidence presented that she had ever been employed; (3) she testified that she planned to become employed and thought she could earn $ 7 an hour, but there was no evidence of the type of employment opportunities that existed or evidence of her employment skills. Also, contrary to the father's argument, the trial court considered the costs of his visits with the child in determining the amount of child support it awarded. Finally, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.310.7(1)(c) (2000) required the schedule detailing custody and visitation time for the child with each party to include Father's Day, but the trial court's judgment did not. Thus, the judgment detailing custody and visitation was inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed that part of the trial court's judgment that designated times of visitation to allow the trial court to make changes in the visitation schedule to include provision for Father's Day.

The court held that, for the purposes of standing, defendant was &quot;aggrieved&quot; by the search and seizure, as provided in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 542.296.1. However, the record was devoid of evidence as to defendant's having an interest in the bag. The court remanded to determine whether defendant had standing on the Fourth Amendment challenge, as the State, at the suppression hearing, failed to present evidence of the department's standardized criteria governing the opening of closed containers. Because defendant failed to show that he properly injected the defense of the non-lethal use exemption, the exemption did not apply.

The court held that a new trial was not required because the jury was not prejudiced by the closing argument, but rather the malingerer defense evoked a strong adverse reaction from the jury. Also the subcontractor failed to object to the closing argument at trial. The court held that remittitur was proper because the trial court considered the nature and extent of the carpenter's injuries, as well as other cases. The court found that the trial court erred in denying the carpenter's request for prejudgment interest under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 408.040.2 because the statutory requirements were met when the written settlement demand was sent by certified mail and the demand exceeded the judgment. The court found that the wife's judgment did not exceed the demand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the trial court judgment that denied prejudgment interest on the carpenter's damage award and affirmed the remainder of the trial court judgment on the remaining points.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed the two actions in an attempt to collect unpaid assessments. The court affirmed in part. The foreclosure remedy under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 141.260 of the Land Tax Collection Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 141, did not apply to property owned by a housing authority because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 99.200 of the Housing Authorities Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 99, flatly exempted such property from foreclosure except for any liens voluntarily created by the housing authority. Thus, the housing authority was entitled to judgment in the first action. As to the second action, the court reversed. The legislature, in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 88.812, did not clearly express an intent to allow assessments against state property. It also was not clearly implied by the language allowing charter cities to adopt terms, conditions, and procedures. Under Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19(a), a city charter could not exercise powers that were limited by statute. Thus, to the extent that the city's charter permitted assessment of state property, it was void and the judgment against the authority had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

The individual contended that she was entitled to an order prohibiting the judge from taking further action in the dissolution action. The individual argued that the judge was without jurisdiction in that action, notwithstanding the fact that the dissolution action had been consolidated with a separate petition for review of a child support enforcement order, in that the individual dismissed the dissolution action without prejudice on December 18, 2003. The court agreed. The plain language of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 478.001 (2000) and the application of rules of statutory construction compelled a finding that nothing the drug court commissioner did in the case had any legal effect. Consequently, the &quot;introduction of evidence&quot; prong of Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 67.02(a)(2) (2004) was not implicated. Since the court could find no other reason why she was not entitled to voluntarily dismiss her petition, the court made the preliminary order in prohibition absolute.</SPAN></P>

The driver's license had been suspended pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.304(3) (Cum. Supp. 2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's operating license was suspended in Missouri for 30 days following an alcohol-related conviction in Ohio. The Director's letter to the driver indicated that the suspension was based on eight points added to his driving record for the driving-while-intoxicated conviction. The trial court set aside the suspension. On appeal, the court found that the Director, by introducing records showing that the driver was convicted of an alcohol-related offense, made a prima facie case that the driver was not qualified for a license. The court further found that the entries on the Ohio sentencing entry form were susceptible to two interpretations: either the $ 1,000 that the driver paid was paid as a bond forfeiture or the sum was paid as a fine for an alcohol-related offense. Even if the court found that an ambiguity existed so that it was impossible to determine whether the Ohio court forfeited the driver's bond or found him guilty and assessed a fine, the ambiguity was insufficient to rebut the Director's prima facie case. The evidence sufficiently demonstrated a conviction, as defined by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.010(3) (Cum. Supp. 2003).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the case to the trial court to reinstate the suspension of the driver's driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that the trial court erred in finding that it was permissible under Mo. Rev.

The appellate court noted that on his two convictions for which he served 120-day call back sentences, the inmate was received by the DOC to serve a term of 120 days following his sentencing; thus, the trial court both correctly determined that his prior sentences under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 559.115 (2000) counted as prior sentences under the statutory scheme in existence at the time of those determinations. However, the appellate court held that the record provided no indication as to whether the inmate's parole eligibility date had been recalculated in accordance with the revised provisions of Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the worker and his employer contended that the trial court erred in affirming the decision of the board because St. Louis, Mo., Plumbing Code &sect; P-24.7 was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that because the worker and his employer failed to specifically invoke either the Commerce Clause or the Privileges and Immunities Clause in their amended petition, and because these issues were not raised before the trial court, the issues were not properly preserved for review. While their due process arguments were properly raised, their claims still failed. Section P-24.7, though not specifically pertaining to plumbing, was within the St. Louis Plumbing Code; therefore, the sprinkler fitter occupation was technically part of the plumbing business. Sprinkler fittings were an integral part of a building's fire protection. Thus, the city had an interest in maintaining a standard of fire safety in order to protect its residents, and it was reasonable for the city to have certain testing and licensing measures in place to ensure that all people working in this field adhered to the same standards. As such, the appellate court held that &sect; P-24.7 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting a videotape containing child pornography and in overruling his motion to quash the entire venire. Defendant was suspected of making and selling methamphetamine, and the videotape was found in his home during execution of a search warrant. The court held that the videotape was properly seized by police officers pursuant to the plain view doctrine. Officers lawfully entered defendant's home pursuant to a warrant and entered his television room while executing the warrant. Once the officers entered that room, the videotape was located in plain sight. The officers had a lawful right to view the videotape once it was found in plain sight, and its incriminating character was immediately apparent to the seizing officers. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in denying defendant's motion to quash the entire venire, based on one allegedly prejudicial comment made at a different trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri, that granted summary judgment in favor of the State in defendant's declaratory action seeking jail-time credit under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.031 (1994) and seeking a declaration that pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.019 (2000) he could not be required to serve 50 percent of his sentence before being eligible for parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he was entitled to jail-time credit under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.031 (1994) for the period he was incarcerated while waiting to be tried on receiving stolen property charges, which resulted in revocation of his parole on his sentence for a prior stealing offense. The court held that defendant was not entitled to jail-time credit under &sect; 558.031 because his incarceration was related to his parole violation on the prior stealing offense and defendant's incarceration time for his parole violation could not also be credited to the sentence for the subsequent receiving stolen property offense because the sentence for the subsequent offense was to run consecutively to the sentence on the stealing offense. The court also noted that the detainer exception provided in &sect; 558.031.1 did not apply. The court found that defendant failed to preserve his claim that &sect; 558.031 was unconstitutional if he was not entitled to jail-time credit. The court rejected defendant's ex post facto claims regarding Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.019 (Supp. 1998) and the minimum sentences that &sect; 558.019 required to be served before eligibility for parole.</SPAN></P>

Appellee business owners filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared that the city had violated Sullivan, Mo., City Code &sect; 69.070 (1985) by incorrectly classifying and billing the business customers at the commercial rate rather than the industrial usage rate. On appeal, the city argued that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the customers' complaint because there could be no damages against the city unless the rates were shown to be unreasonable. The court rejected the city's argument and held that the customers were not challenging the reasonableness of the rates or the classification scheme but merely claimed that the city misconstrued the ordinance and incorrectly classified and billed them. The city also claimed that the trial court erred in awarding damages on the customers' claim for equitable relief under count I. The court agreed, holding that damages under count I were improper because the customers had an adequate remedy at law under count III for monetary damages for the overcharges. The court rejected the city's claim of error as to the prejudgment interest awarded under Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After relator father's conviction for sexual abuse of his adopted child was reversed and remanded for retrial for the prosecution's failure to disclose that the mother and the lead detective had been engaged in a relationship for a year before trial, the father requested disclosure of the adoption records. Respondent Family Court Administrative Judge for Jackson County, Missouri, denied the father's request. The father sought mandamus relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his mandamus petition, the father argued that because the information contained in the adoption records was directly relevant and essential to his defense, he was entitled to discovery. The judge argued that disclosure of adoption records was prohibited by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 453.120 (2000), except in limited situations, and that the father's request did not fit within the limited disclosure exception contained in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 453.121 (2000). While disagreeing with the father's Confrontation Clause argument, the reviewing court found that because it had already been determined that the adoption records might contain evidence relevant to the father's defense, denying him access to such evidence would violate his right to due process. To hold the statutory privilege superior to the father's right to obtain potentially exculpatory evidence would be unconstitutional. The reviewing court also found that an in camera review by the trial court would serve the father's interest without destroying the State's need to protect the confidentiality of adoption records.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court generally held: as applied, the Missouri sex offender program did not excessively entangle the government with a particular religion in violation of the United States or Missouri Constitutions; the probate court did not err in denying defendant's request for a Frye hearing; the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting actuarials as part of the expert's opinion of risk prediction; jury instruction 8 did not have a substantial potential for prejudicial effect as an average jury would understand that a finding that defendant was a SVP would subject him to the control, care and treatment of the department of mental health and the instruction did not improperly minimize the jury's responsibility in finding whether defendant was a SVP.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city alleged that many firearms were manufactured, distributed, and sold in such a manner that they could be purchased by juveniles, criminals, and other prohibited persons for use in the commission of crimes. The city argued that the widespread availability and misuse of guns by juveniles, felons, and other unauthorized users was an immense national problem, constituting an ongoing public nuisance and causing the city direct harm. The trial court dismissed the petition for failure to state a claim. The court affirmed, finding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21.750(4), (5) (Supp. 2003) specifically prohibited cities from bringing tort claims related to the lawful design, manufacture, marketing, distribution, or sale of firearms or ammunition to the public.

The trial court had also denied the driver's request to modify the judgment by eliminating prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's vehicle struck the car in which the passenger was riding, causing the passenger injuries. The passenger settled his action against the operator of the vehicle that he was in, and he received $ 25,000 in underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits from that operator's insurer. A jury trial resulted in a $ 200,000 verdict in favor of the passenger, and the trial court denied the driver's request to credit the UIM benefits, although it did credit the settlement amount received by the passenger. Prejudgment interest was also awarded, and the driver appealed. The court found that the collateral source rule did not apply, as the passenger incurred no expense, obligation, or liability in securing the insurance coverage. Accordingly, it was error for the trial court to fail to reduce the award by the amount paid as UIM benefits. The offer of settlement made by the passenger's attorney complied with the statutory requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 408.040.2 (2000), as there was no requirement that the offer be made after the action had been commenced. The court declined to review alleged errors under the plain error doctrine, as there was no &quot;manifest injustice&quot; shown.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court to the extent of remanding the matter for deduction from the judgment of the UIM benefits paid to the passenger.

The Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) entered summary judgment in favor of defendants, finding that they were entitled to immunity under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11111.

After the preliminary hearing, the suspension of privileges was continued. The anesthesiologist subsequently tendered his resignation. On the same day, the anesthesiologist's attorney sent a letter to defendants' attorney stating that there was no longer a reason to have the full hearing. The anesthesiologist then filed suit seeking damages and injunctive and declaratory relief against defendants. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding that defendants were immune under the Act. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected the anesthesiologist's argument that he was denied a full and fair hearing at the preliminary hearing. The court stated that the preliminary hearing was authorized by the hospital's by-laws and was not mandated by the Act. Additionally, a full hearing was scheduled by the parties. The court also found that the numerous complaints concerning the anesthesiologist's patient care demonstrated that the suspension was based on a reasonable belief that such action was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree stemming from the deaths of a mother and her three children. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, stating that the trial court committed no error in denying defendant's request that an individual also involved in the murders be compelled to testify. The record supported the trial court's factual determination that he would not have testified even if ordered to do so. Likewise, there was a rational basis for the court's conclusion that the other individual sufficiently invoked his privilege against self-incrimination and that his trial testimony could tend to incriminate him. Finally, defendant's offer of proof was insufficient to establish what the other individual's testimony would have been and why such testimony was relevant and material to the issues in defendant's case. Further, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial made during closing argument, because the prosecutor's argument merely provided the jury with the State's view of why the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of deliberation as to the children and their mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of possessing a pit bull, and he appealed, arguing that the trial court's judgment was not supported by sufficient facts and that the city ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite, because it failed to provide a definition of &quot;pit bull.&quot; The court disagreed and affirmed, stating that, given the distinctive physical and behavioral characteristics of pit bulls, as well as the general knowledge and information available to dog owners, it should have been apparent to defendant whether the dog he owned was of the &quot;pit bull&quot; breed as was prohibited by the ordinance. Further, whether a particular dog was a pit bull was an evidentiary issue for trial, not a constitutional law issue. The parties also agreed in their Joint Stipulation of Facts that a website recognized that American Staffordshire Terriers, the breed of dog that defendant owned, were typically referred to as pit bulls. Therefore, the trial court's judgment finding that defendant violated the ordinance possessing a pit bull in the city was supported by the facts and evidence before it.</SPAN></P>

The licensee did not deny making the contribution but claimed that the Commission erred by disciplining the licensee because the ordinance infringed free speech rights and conflicted with Missouri's Campaign Finance Disclosure Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 130 (2000). On appeal the court affirmed the Commission's final order, which imposed a fine on the licensee. Although the Commission imposed the fine on the ground that the licensee had violated a city ordinance, the court upheld the discipline under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 313.812.14(1) (2000) on the ground that the licensee failed to make any provision to comply with the ordinance. The hearing officer heard evidence that the licensee took no steps to properly challenge the validity of the ordinance in the 20 months between receiving notice of disciplinary action and the disciplinary hearing.

The Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) granted summary judgment to respondents, the city and others, dismissing the case with prejudice, and denied the applicants' motion to reconsider, set aside, or vacate the judgment. The applicants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants' suit sought review of the Council's denial of their respective applications for taxi cab licenses and alleged violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court granted summary judgment to respondents on the ground that the case had been rendered moot by the statutorily necessitated repeal of St. Louis County, Mo., Revised Ordinances ch. 806, which action removed from respondents the authority to make such licensing decisions. On appeal the court held that the issue regarding the arbitrariness or capriciousness of the denial of the applications was moot because respondents no longer had authority to approve or deny taxi cab licensing decisions; therefore, the relief requested, and order mandating issuance of the licenses, was impossible. The fact that the applicants had also requested attorney fees and costs did not result in a surviving claim because the applicants were not prevailing parties and, therefore, were not entitled to such relief. The court also found no error in the grant of summary judgment on the claim alleging violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because the claim was based on mere allegations and, therefore, did not comply with Mo.

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the petition for commitment. He also challenged the constitutionality of the sexually violent predator laws as applied to him, in that he claimed the laws were punitive in nature. The appellate court found that defendant suffered from a mental abnormality, which three doctors diagnosed as pedophilia, sexually attracted to females, nonexclusive. The testimony of one of the doctors constituted sufficient evidence in the record upon which a juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. Based on defendant's diagnosis of pedophilia, coupled with the evidence that he had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior, the appellate court held that his right to due process and to be free from double jeopardy were not violated. Contrary to defendant's contention, the State did not impermissibly seek to extend its plea agreement to ensure defendant received sex offender treatment. Thus, denial of his motion to dismiss was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following seven years of imprisonment on two counts of sexual assault in the first degree, the State petitioned to have defendant civilly committed as a sexually violent predator (SVP), pursuant to Missouri's Sexual Violent Predator Act (SVP Act), Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.480 et seq. (2000). A jury found defendant to be an SVP beyond a reasonable doubt, and he appealed, alleging the Circuit Court of Iron County, Probate Division (Missouri) erred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, as defendant failed to timely object to the State's expert testimony at trial, his assertion of error was not preserved for appeal. Second, defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion to dismiss as a means of enforcing the plea agreement. As the SVP Act was not in existence at the time of the plea, and because commitment under the Act was a collateral consequence of pleading guilty, the court found that, in seeking to have defendant civilly committed, the State did not breach the plea agreement. Third, defendant argued that the trial court erred in submitting certain jury instructions over his objection. Considering that he admitted that the instruction in question was acceptable and offered an instruction that, while more detailed, contained the same information, it was disingenuous for defendant to argued on appeal that the instruction was erroneous and prejudicial. Finally, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss, in which he argued that the SVP Act was unconstitutional because it was a denial of equal protection. But, the Missouri Supreme Court addressed and soundly rejected this argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician, who had practiced obstetrics and gynecology for many years, engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with two of his female patients. The Administrative Hearing Commission entered a consent order between the physician and the Board. One of the provisions contained in the order was that the physician was required to have a female nurse chaperone present during all female patient visits. The physician did not believe that he was required to have a chaperone present while he was taking medical history from his patients. The Board issued a second disciplinary order, finding that the physician violated the disciplinary terms previously imposed. The circuit court affirmed the second order. On appeal, the physician argued that the Board improperly applied Missouri law to the facts in determining that the first order unambiguously required a chaperone be present throughout the entirety of all office visits by his female patients. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment, stating that the phrase &quot;present during all female patient visits&quot; could reasonably be understood to mean &quot;present for the physical examination portion of all female patient visits.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 287.030.1(3) in denying his fund claim; and the evidence in the record was insufficient to support the ALJ's alternative determination that the employee's claim was exempt because he was performing farm labor at the time he was injured. The appellate court found that the express language in &sect; 287.030 indicating that the &quot;five or more employees&quot; definition of the term &quot;employer&quot; was applicable throughout the workers' compensation statute. There was no need for the legislature to include the &quot;five or more employees&quot; requirement in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.220.5, because the term &quot;employer&quot; was statutorily defined to include that requirement. A fund claim was allowed only if the employee's employer was uninsured and not otherwise exempt under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.030. Because the employer could have defended the claim on the basis that he had fewer than five employees, the ALJ did not err in finding this defense equally available to the fund. The legislature had a rational basis for allowing the fund to invoke the same defenses available to employers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was previously convicted of rape and was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment.

The trial court granted the State's motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its motion, the State argued that defendant had prior rape and sexual abuse convictions, and several other sexual assault charges which did not result in convictions. The State further contended that defendant had shown no remorse for his victims, that he denied he had ever committed a sexual assault, and was likely to re-offend. Defendant had filed a motion to dismiss, in which he argued that the sexually violent predator statutes, as applied, violated his right to free exercise of religion. He further asserted that jurisdiction over his appeal should have been in the Missouri Supreme Court because his appeal involved a challenge to the constitutionality of a Missouri statute. The appellate court held that defendant's constitutional challenge was properly preserved in the trial court because his early filing gave more than adequate time for the State to respond and for the trial court to identify and rule on the issue. The appellate court further held that on clear indication that defendant's constitutional challenge was real and substantial, and made in good faith, was that it was one of first impression; thus, the supreme court had exclusive jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 568.045.1(1) (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court convicted defendant of second-degree felony murder of a three-month-old infant who was one of 18 children she cared for in her home. It also convicted her of 19 counts of endangering the welfare of a child in connection with her endeavoring to care for 19 children by herself. The court reversed one count of the endangering the welfare of a child after the State conceded that insufficient evidence existed. The remainder of the conviction was affirmed. The denial of defendant's motion for a bill of particulars was proper, pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 23.04, as the information charged that she knowingly endangered children by watching more children than she could safely care for and supervise, and that was sufficient to allow her to prepare for her defense. Further, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 568.045 was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant, because a person of ordinary intelligence would know that she was prohibited from knowingly acting in a manner that created a substantial risk to the life, body, or health of a child less than 17 years old. The court concluded that a reasonable fact finder could have found that defendant was guilty of felony murder.</SPAN></P>

After the action was dismissed, the client sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the client was required to show state action. This required a showing that the action was taken pursuant to state law and significant state involvement. A State was only responsible for the act of a private party when the act was compelled by law. The court determined that participation in the IOLTA program was voluntary. It was not compelled under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 4-1.15. The decision to deposit the funds in such an account was made by the attorney selected by the client. Therefore, the act of depositing funds into an IOLTA account and the subsequent transfer of interest earned on the account to the Foundation were not attributable to the State.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the adjudication and rejected defendant's arguments on appeal. The appellate court noted that, as the Missouri Supreme Court had previously rejected equal protection arguments that defendant had put forth, as the SVP Act was tailored to protect the public from the small percentage of persons adjudged to be sexually violent offenders, and that secure confinement did not deny equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was stopped on suspicion of speeding; when the officer approached, he noticed a strong smell of intoxicants. The driver failed field sobriety tests and refused to submit to a portable breathalyzer test. The driver then consented to the test after the officer arrested her and advised of the implied consent notification, but she was unable or unwilling to provide a breath sample sufficient to register as a valid test on the machine. During this aborted test, the officer observed on the machine's digital display a blood alcohol content (BAC) reading of .137 percent. The officer pushed a button that generated a printout reflecting the machine's reading and offered the driver another opportunity to take the test, and the driver refused. The trial court reversed the suspension and held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.020.2 was unconstitutional, as it was vague as to whether a second test was required if a valid test had been obtained. The appellate court reversed and reinstated the suspension. The appellate court held that, as &sect; 577.020.2 clearly allowed for two chemical tests of a driver, regardless of whether the first test was valid, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patron sued defendant restaurant for injuries she allegedly sustained in a slip and fall. A jury in the Circuit Court of Buchanan County, Missouri, awarded her damages. The restaurant appealed, claiming the trial court erred in overruling its objection to the patron's closing argument. The patron cross-appealed, claiming the trial court should have awarded her prejudgment interest under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 408.040.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patron hurt her back and knee after slipping on a wet floor. After she filed suit, she sent the restaurant an offer to settle her claim for $ 300,000; it was not accepted. The jury found the restaurant was 100 percent at fault and assessed damages at $ 300,000. The trial court awarded the patron costs of $ 1010. The restaurant argued at trial that the patron' injuries were due to a preexisting condition. During closing, the patron's counsel mentioned the restaurant's failure to call its own medical doctor, which the restaurant alleged was an improper attempt to shift the burden of proof. The appellate court disagreed. Counsel never misstated the law, nor did he assert that the restaurant had an obligation or duty to bring in medical evidence. The argument was a brief comment on the fact that the patron's medical evidence was uncontroverted, a permissible argument, and it did not amount to prejudicial error. As ''judgment'' was statutorily defined as the final determination of the right of the parties in the action, the judgment herein was for $ 301,010 (the verdict amount plus costs); therefore, the patron had been entitled to prejudgment interest under &sect; 408.040.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the trial court in order to modify its judgment to award the customer prejudgment interest. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.480-513 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate challenged the trial court's jurisdiction to commit him to the custody of the Missouri Department of Mental Health as a sexually violent predator (SVP). The trial court found that the inmate, currently confined as a criminal sexual psychopath (CSP), suffered from a mental abnormality making him more likely than not to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if not confined to a secure facility, and the inmate did not challenge that finding. The unavoidable conclusion, thus, was that the SVP statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.480 et seq., unambiguously conferred jurisdiction over the inmate to the trial court notwithstanding the continuing jurisdiction of the court that committed him as a CSP, and that it was free to do so. The inmate also alleged that the SVP statute violated his equal protection rights. But, the secure confinement of persons adjudicated to be SVPs, as provided in the SVP law, was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. The Supreme Court of Missouri having found the SVP law not to be invalid in the face of an equal protection claim virtually identical to that presented by the inmate, his second point was without merit and was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter filed her action alleging that her father sexually abused her as a child.

The court affirmed. The trial court did not err in denying the father's motions because the action was timely. Pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.140 (2000), the applicable statute of limitations for battery was two years, and with the benefit of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.170 (2000), the daughter's claim survived for two years after reaching the age of majority. Because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 516.371 (Cum.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.304 (Cum. Supp. 2002), after it was revoked following an alcohol-related conviction in Iowa. The trial court refused to admit appellant Missouri Director of Revenue's certified record of the Iowa conviction and set aside the revocation. The director appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the record of the Iowa conviction was not an authenticated record under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 490.130 (Cum. Supp. 2002), and, thus, was not legally admissible in Missouri as showing or proving a conviction. The trial court also noted that the Iowa conviction did not indicate the legal status of the judge, nor whether the driver had legal counsel. The Director argued that the trial court erred in refusing to admit the record of the Iowa conviction. The appellate court found that the driver's record, including the Iowa conviction, was properly certified pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.312.1 (2000), and was, therefore, admissible. The requirement that the Iowa judge who entered the conviction be a lawyer and that the driver be represented by or waive the right to an attorney in writing did not apply. The Director could rely upon convictions in other states to revoke a license if the out-of-state conviction would result in the assessment of points in Missouri. The driver did not show that the facts on which the Director relied were either unlawful, unconstitutional, or otherwise insufficient to support the revocation of his driver's license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and remanded to the trial court to reinstate the revocation of the driver's license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged four points of error including that his conviction warranted reversal because he executed a waiver of counsel form absent disclosure on the record of the perils of self-representation. He further contended that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his trial de novo because it did not render a judgment. The appellate court initially noted that a review of the record demonstrated only the waiver of counsel form which both defendant and the trial judge signed. The appellate court found that the record was devoid of the trial court's searching inquiry into the validity of the waiver that was required. Although the record revealed that the waiver form was signed approximately one month before trial, the appellate court held that there was no record of a hearing accompanying it that would have given context to the circumstances under which the form was signed or indicate that the court advised defendant of his constitutional right to counsel. However, the appellate court concluded that the applicable rules contained no requirement that the word &quot;judgment&quot; appear on judgments of conviction in a municipal court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One evening, defendant left his girlfriend and his infant niece in their apartment to go to a local coffee shop. When he returned, he saw the victim, a neighbor, standing over the bed where the girlfriend and infant were sleeping. Defendant grabbed the victim and ultimately choked him to death with a belt. Defendant then took the victim's body and dumped it in a creek. Defendant subsequently confessed to a friend, who taped the conversation and delivered it to the public defender's office. Defendant was charged with second-degree murder, but convicted of voluntary manslaughter. The court affirmed on appeal. The trial court did not err in sustaining the State's objection to defendant's cross-examination of defendant's friend. Defendant had sought to examine the friend's alleged bias including a motivation to testify falsely in order to obtain a benefit from the State concerning the friend's own bad check charges. However, the charges against the friend had been disposed of prior to defendant's trial and there was no evidence that the friend could have perceived a possible benefit by testifying in the case as he did. Defendant further failed to show any prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and the father had one child. The father died in a motorcycle accident. Subsequently, the grandparents filed a petition for grandparent visitation rights. The mother began denying the grandparents' visitation. The grandparents filed a motion for contempt. The evidence of the child's soiling incidents and his exhibiting emotional problems even when he had no contact with the grandparents combined with the mother's testimony that she agreed to temporary unsupervised visitation between the child and the grandparents constituted substantial evidence to support the trial court's findings regarding its order of unsupervised grandparent visitation. Additionally, the trial court did not misapply the law by noting that a substantial change in the child's circumstances had occurred. The evidence established that the trial court balanced the interests of the parties, the child's best interests, and concluded that unsupervised visitation with the grandparents was appropriate. Finally, because neither party prevailed on their main issue, attorney's fees should not have been awarded to the grandparents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realtor borrowed money from an individual lender to purchase property and sell it for a profit. Initially, he made the payments required by the promissory note; however, he eventually stopped making payments. The bank began foreclosure proceedings on the lender's home. When the lender tried to stop the foreclosure, she found out that the realtor never recorded the deed of trust on the properties which secured her loan to him and that he had sold some of those properties without notifying her. The realtor acted in the course of his real estate business because he purchased the property to sell at a profit in furtherance of his business. Also, he intentionally concealed material facts from the lender in the course of their transaction because he did not notify her of the sale of some of the property which secured her loan. Finally, his intentional concealment of material facts in the conduct of the real estate transaction with the lender was an indication that he lacked good moral character. Thus, the trial court did not err in affirming the suspension and subsequent probation imposed upon the realtor's licenses.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, denied the motion and convicted defendant as charged. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence for conviction of one of the felony murder counts and one of the armed criminal action counts because the counts applied to the unborn child of the victim. He also alleged that the trial court plainly erred in failing to compel a witness to testify. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.205 (2000), namely that an unborn child was considered a person, applied to define the term &quot;person&quot; under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.021.1(2) (2000); thus, under the statute and the circumstances of the instant case, causing the death of an unborn child was causing the death of a &quot;person.&quot; Further, sufficient evidence existed to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; the record established that the murder of the victim, committed during the robbery, also caused the death of her unborn child. As defendant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that a manifest injustice resulted in the trial court's failure to compel the witness to testify, the trial court did not plainly err in allowing the witness to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, entered judgment in the amount prayed and denied defendants' motions to set aside the judgment. The employer and its insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying action involved two judgments entered by the trial court. On review, the employer and its insurer contended the trial court erred in denying their motions to set aside pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 74.05(d) and 74.06(b). The appellate court found that it could not review the first judgment from which the employer and its insurer failed to timely file within 10 days as a motion to set aside under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 74.06 did not extend the trial court's jurisdiction over the matter or postpone the finality of the judgment. As to the second judgment, because the trial court had no discretion and had to enter judgment in the amount of the Commission's award, and because there were no further factual issues to be resolved, due process did not require notice prior to the rendition of the judgment under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.500 (2000). Thus, the judgment was not void or irregular because the employer and its insurer were not given notice prior to entry of judgment. Further, the procedures governing default judgments under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 74.05(d) did not apply as a judgment rendered pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 287.500 (2000) was not a default judgment.</SPAN></P>

However, the appellate court noted that no language in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 227(b), limited the private right of action only to individuals actually receiving the call. The statute was violated by the placing of the call to a residence. The appellate court held that clearly, the call was not made to conduct research or a market survey (an exemption under the Act), rather the call was made for commercial purposes. Thus, the question was whether the call was one that did not adversely affect the privacy rights to be protected under the Act, and did not include the transmission of any unsolicited advertisement. The appellate court concluded the undisputed script of the prerecorded message constituted an unsolicited advertisement and violated the Act. Finally, the Act left open many alternative communication channels for telemarketers, and the Act's prohibition did not infringe upon the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's predecessor in interest filed an application for a refund of use taxes paid after Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.748 was struck down by the United States Supreme Court. The application did not contain any documentation. After only a portion of the taxes were refunded by the Director, the taxpayer sought review. On review, the AHC reversed the Director's decision. The Director then filed an appeal. In reversing the AHC's decision, the court determined that the application did not reflect that the taxpayer was claiming that the use taxes had been improperly categorized as sales taxes. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.190.3 (2000), a writing was required for each request for a refund. Moreover, the applicant was required to sign the request and state the specific grounds upon which the claim was founded. The evidence showed that the taxpayer did not attach any documentation to its refund claim. Further, it did not provide the Director with any supplemental explanation of what its claims entailed. Therefore, there was not sufficient information about the claim to apprise the Director of the taxpayer's position regarding the refund. As such, a partial denial of the claim was proper.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, prohibited the commission from using the expired eligibility lists. The commission appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the commission contended the trial court erred in denying its motion to dismiss for lack of standing, issuing a writ of prohibition when a writ of mandamus was requested, and holding that the city charter did not give the commission the authority to reinstate a promotional list after it expired. The appellate court found that the trial court did not misapply the law in concluding that a firefighter had standing as his private rights were directly affected by the commission's decision reviving the expired lists. Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion by treating the request for review by a writ of mandamus pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 (2000) as a request for review by a writ of prohibition, and granting that relief, as it could grant the appropriate remedy irrespective of the firefighter's prayer. Looking to the commission's own rules, the appellate court determined that they did not permit the &quot;life&quot; of an employment list to be &quot;extended&quot; after it had expired. The power conferred on the commission by the city charter to consider and determine matters involved in the administration of its rules did not permit the commission to violate its rules.</SPAN></P>

The court had not been provided any authority that supported the trial court's determination that the city's statute was arbitrary, unreasonable, and unconstitutional. Further, the court's independent research disclosed no such authority. Adoption of an ordinance limiting the number of liquor licenses a municipality could issue that did not conflict with applicable state statutes was a legislative act that required no prescription of standards or criteria. The city's claim that its enactment of an ordinance limiting the number of liquor licenses it would issue was a valid police power, notwithstanding that it limits competition, was well taken.

The trial court dismissed the prisoner's petition. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner argued that the trial court erred by dismissing his lawsuit because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150.1 (2000) entitled him to file an injunction action seeking judicial review. Specifically, he contended that the prison administrators' decision to continue his assignment to administrative segregation was a non-contested case subject to judicial review under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 (2000). The appellate court initially noted that the Missouri General Assembly had mandated two different paths for judicial review of administrative decisions, depending on whether the case was contested or non-contested. The appellate court held that the prisoner was entitled to a hearing concerning his administrative segregation pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 217.375 (2000); therefore, his case was a contested case, as defined by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.010(2). The appellate court concluded that the prisoner should have sought judicial review as a contested case instead of review pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 as a non-contested case by filing a petition for review by injunction; thus, the trial court correctly determined that it did not have jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) affirmed the decision of respondent, the Missouri State Tax Commission, denying appellant license collector's motion to strike respondent taxpayer's testimony and exhibits and the Commission's determination that the excluded property was not subject to the manufacturer's tax. The license collector appealed. The taxpayer cross-appealed the classification of property issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission stated that although the taxpayer's evidence was filed late, the license collector had adequate time to prepare for cross-examination and was not prejudiced by the late filing. The appellate court found that while the taxpayer was not in technical compliance with the discovery deadline established by the Commission, it also did not try to introduce its evidence at or after the evidentiary hearing. Thus, because the hearing officer had broad discretion to allow evidence that was not in technical compliance with discovery rules, the Commission did not err in admitting the taxpayer's direct testimony and exhibits into evidence. Additionally, the photographs of the equipment provided a reasonable basis for one to conclude that annexation and adaptation had occurred with respect to the excluded property. Thus, the Commission's decision that the spouting, electrical items, buckets, legs, bins, boots, housings, and boilers constituted fixtures was proper and they were not subject to the manufacturer's tax. Finally, because the taxpayer's complaints for review of the tax assessment did not specify misclassification, that issue was not properly before the Commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Scott County, Missouri, dismissed plaintiff company's motion to file an amended petition against defendant city after the city repealed an ordinance that the company had sought to declare void and unenforceable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company alleged that the trial court erred in dismissing its suit based on the doctrine of mootness, and that simply repealing the ordinance did not moot certain issues, namely specific relief requested under certain provisions of the Sunshine Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.010-030. The appellate court noted that the only mention of Missouri's Sunshine Law in the company's petition was in paragraph 21, where there were only vague and general allegations that passage of the ordinance violated the law. None of the allegations charged Sunshine Law violations as a basis for voiding the ordinance. The trial court could reasonably have concluded that the company's petition did not rely on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 610.027 as its remedy source, as the company argued, but sought a declaration of invalidity of the ordinance and to enjoin its enforcement only per the Declaratory Judgment Act. The company's proposed amended petition clearly sought relief under the Sunshine Law; however, any such claim was time-barred. Any violations of the Sunshine Law involving the ordinance occurred on or before the date the ordinance was enacted by the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed a tariff with the Public Service Commission (Missouri) and proposed a rebalancing under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 392.245.9 (2000) of the amounts the company charged for intrastate access services and the charges assessed for basic local service. The Office sought to block the proposed rebalancing and requested a hearing, but the Commission denied the hearing request and approved the tariff, which the trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Under &sect; 392.245.9, a hearing was not required, and the court concluded that, when proceeding under the statute in a file and suspend case, the matter was a noncontested case in which there was no automatic right to a hearing. The court was not persuaded, especially in light of case law, that there was a property interest at stake that required procedural due process protections. Thus, given the nature of the Commission's determination, the court did not find that it abused its discretion in denying the Office a hearing. However, the Commission failed to make adequate findings with regard to the company's rebalancing such that judicial review was not possible. Thus, the court reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent church filed an action against appellants, a city, its engineer, and its board of adjustment, seeking declaratory relief and injunctive relief relating to the denial of the church's sign permit application. By an amended complaint the church also sought a writ of certiorari under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.110 (2000). The Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) ruled in favor of the church. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city engineer denied the church's two sign permit applications, citing noncompliance with city ordinances. After a hearing on the church's complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and review under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.110 (2000), the trial court entered judgment in favor of the church and concluded that appellants had no authority under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.020 (2000) to apply the sign regulations to the church and enjoined appellants from prohibiting the church's sign construction. On appeal the court reversed. The court held that the trial court exercised its discretion to grant relief under the declaratory action and injunctive relief claims instead of under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.110 (2000). There was no evidence that the court exercised its plenary jurisdiction and its limited statutory jurisdiction simultaneously. The court further held that the church was subject to the city's sign ordinance and, therefore, the trial court exceeded its authority by permanently enjoining the city from interfering with the church's sign construction. Because such injunctive relief should not have been granted, the church should have been granted statutory review pursuant to &sect; 89.110.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court to exercise its jurisdiction for statutory review.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, ruled that the division was without standing to pursue its action under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 210.826, 830, and that the Governor's recent executive order did not transfer standing. The division appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the division contended that the trial court erred in holding that it did not have standing to file actions pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826 (2000) or to act as next of friend for minor children pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.830 (2000). The appellate court agreed, finding that the Governor had the authority under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 26.500-26.510 (2000) to issue the executive order in question, which met all of the statutory requirements governing the issuance of executive orders to implement plans designed to reorganize state executive agencies and thereby effectively and lawfully transferred to the division nearly all of the authority of the division of child support enforcement. As the executive agency reorganization plan set out in the order was validly promulgated and specifically authorized by statute, it had the force of law and was enforceable in court proceedings. Thus, the trial court erred in ruling that division did not have standing to file its petition in this matter.</SPAN></P>

The leaseholders appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The leaseholders argued that the commission erred in affirming the reassessment of the properties in August, 2000, and the BOE's treatment of the properties on the tax rolls as taxable properties for the year 2000, because neither Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.380 (2000) nor St. Charles County, Mo., Code &sect; 120.220.2 authorized the commission's or BOE's actions. The appellate court noted that the properties did not escape assessment because they were given a $ 0 value by the assessor; the properties were listed in the assessor's books in this manner because the leaseholders were successful in their prior attempts to challenge the assessor's assignment of a true value to these properties. The leaseholders were involved in litigation that led to the striking down their tax-exempt status, such that they knew that their leasehold interests would then be subject to taxation. The commission did not retroactively apply the law by merely enforcing the opinion that found Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 172.273.3 (1994) to be unconstitutional. The leaseholders were aware of the possibility that the statute could be found unconstitutional and that the properties could be subject to assessment and taxation.</SPAN></P>

The survivors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The survivors argued that the trial court erred in finding no liability coverage under the entity's policy with the insurer, because the liquor liability exclusion and exception were ambiguous. The appellate court found that the bar, although part of a non-profit entity, exposed its insurer to the same risks inherent in other drinking establishments operated by for-profit entities. It was licensed to sell alcohol and operated a bar open to the public. Because the entity was in the business of selling and serving alcoholic beverages, it was excluded from liability coverage for selling alcohol to the patron. The survivors' claims of negligence had to fail as there was no cause of action for negligent assistance of an intoxicated person in Missouri. The Dram Shop Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.053 (1986), provided the exclusive, limited cause of action available to third parties whose injuries were proximately caused by a tavern's service of alcoholic beverages to an obviously intoxicated patron.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer was campaigning door-to-door for the office of sheriff. He was off-duty, not in uniform, and operating in a private capacity. Upon arriving at defendant's home, the officer observed marijuana plants growing in a flowerbed abutting defendant's house. The officer went immediately to the sheriff's department and told a deputy about the marijuana growing in defendant's flowerbed. Defendant was placed under arrest and a search warrant was subsequently obtained to search his home where the officers discovered a makeshift methamphetamine laboratory. Because the officer was not employed by the sheriff's department and was not performing duties attendant to his position as a police officer, he was not acting as an agent of the State when he entered defendant's property and was, therefore, not subject to the Fourth Amendment. Thus, his observations provided probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant and the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to quash the warrant. Additionally, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to infer that defendant had knowledge of and control, whether joint or exclusive, over the manufacturing operation clearly present in his home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When plaintiff car buyers discovered altered vehicle identification numbers on their car, they sued defendant used car dealer for common law fraud and negligence per se for violating Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 301.390 (2000). The dealer filed a third party claim against defendant auctioneer for fraudulent misrepresentation. The Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, awarded the buyers compensatory and punitive damages. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying action arose when the dealer bought a car from the auctioneer, and then sold it to the buyers. On review, the auctioneer contended, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the buyers did not present sufficient evidence to prove fraudulent misrepresentation. The appellate court found that it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the implication created by the auctioneer's employee's representation of clean title to the dealer trumped the inference created by the &quot;as is&quot; language in the auction's bid sheet and on signs posted at the auction. Further, a reasonable jury could have inferred that the auctioneer had reason to know that the dealer would retransmit the auctioneer's representation that the car had good title. Considering the auctioneer represented that title to the car was good even though it clearly was not, the appellate court found sufficient evidence to support submission of punitive damages to the jury; the net award was not grossly excessive. Further, there was clear and convincing evidence that the dealer exhibited reckless indifference toward the buyers' rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Phelps County (Missouri) found no child support order in place for plaintiff mother and held that an administrative default child support order was invalid. The mother was awarded child support payments from defendant Director of the Division of Child Support Enforcement, Department of Social Services (Missouri), which judgment was against the Department and defendant father jointly and severally. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A previous trial court decree ordered that both the mother and father support the minor children. Thereafter, the Department sought to collect child support from the mother. A default order was issued that required the mother to pay a certain amount of child support. Over the years, the Department collected over $ 20,000 in child support payments from the mother. She filed an action against the Department and the father to recover the payments. The trial court ruled in her favor. The court reversed in part on appeal. The trial court correctly concluded that there was no court order, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.460(2) (2000), for the mother to pay child support because the previous trial court degree did not set an exact order of payment. The issue of child support then remained open to administrative action under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 454.470, 454.475 (2000). Under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 454.490 (2000), the Department had authority to enter a child support order even though it was not signed by a judge. Thus, the order was legally obtained and the judgment against the Department and father was improper. The mother's appeal was dismissed for failure to abide by procedural rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment against the father and the Department was reversed, as was the finding that the administrative order was invalid. The court dismissed the mother's appeal, and the remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal in the trial court on the grounds that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.020.2 (2000) was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant rested without presenting any evidence. Defendant, proceeding pro se, repeated the constitutional claim on appeal and sought to raise additional claims regarding the validity of the statute. The appellate court did not reach the merits of defendant's claims, holding that defendant's brief was so inadequate that the court had no choice but to decline review. Specifically, the appellate court held that the &quot;points relied on&quot; in defendant's brief did not comply with the requirements of Mo. Sup Ct. R. 84.04(d)(4), as they were, at best, nothing but abstract statements of the law. In addition, defendant's brief did not state the standard of review applicable to each point, nor did it provide specific page references to the legal file or transcript to support his claims of error. Although defendant was proceeding pro se, he was held to the same standards as an attorney in briefing the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Scott County Circuit Court (Missouri), which found defendant to be a sexually violent predator and ordered him committed to the custody of the department of mental health for care and treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by entering judgment without first considering whether, as a result of a mental abnormality, defendant had serious difficulty controlling his behavior. Defendant claimed that he was prejudiced by this alleged error, as this finding was a necessary predicate to finding defendant to be a sexually violent predator. The appellate court agreed and reversed the judgment. The court found that the prior case law defined that jury instruction in sexually violent predator cases under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 632.480 had to define mental abnormality in such a way as to require that the degree to which an individual could not control his or her behavior was at the level of serious difficulty. Because this rule was not controlling law at the time of trial, the State could not be penalized for any failure to offer such evidence. Although defendant's case was a bench trial, not a jury trial, the court found that this standard still applied, and the case had to be remanded to allow the State the opportunity to present evidence and make a submissible case under the standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded for a new trial, with directions for the trial court to proceed in a manner not inconsistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held the lawyers served at the pleasure of the attorney general and maintained their authority only under the discretion of the attorney general. The appellate court further held because the lawyers could not exercise their duties with some continuity and without control of a superior power other than the law, they are not officers for purposes of Mo.

The Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) reversed the decision of recoupment as to one patient and declared Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 13, &sect;&sect; 70-15.070(11)(F) and 70-15.070 invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital appealed from a recoupment demand for Medicaid payments from the Division. The circuit court found that Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 13, &sect;&sect; 70-15.070(11)(F) and 70-15.070, about physician review and a form requirement respectively, were invalid. The Division appealed. The court held that the regulations were not invalid. One regulation allowed for a retrospective physician review of a patient's record to determine whether the hospitalization had been necessary, but the physicians had to written criteria for making their decisions. There were procedural safeguards in the form of appeals from the physician's decision, and there was no due process violation because the hospital was fully notified of the specific requirements in the regulations and how they would be applied. The court also found that the regulation allowing forfeiture of Medicaid payments for the lack of a particular form in a patient's medical record, although harsh, was rationally related to the Division's goal of managing Medicaid funds. The certificate of need form was mandated by federal regulation. Failure to comply with federal regulations could have resulted in loss of federal funds.</SPAN></P>

However, it did not find that in the reasonable future he was not likely to have such a disease or defect, nor was such a finding possible from the evidence. These findings were required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 552.040.9 (2000) before an unconditional release could be granted. The trial court also made no findings in accordance with &sect; 552.040.7. The failure to make the required findings was grounds for reversal under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 73.01(c). The court held that the Missouri statutory scheme of conditional and unconditional releases was constitutional, but the patient failed to meet his burden under the law and reversal of the trial court's decision was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Director sent the motorist a letter that denied his application for a driver's license based on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 302.060(9) (2000), which provided that a license was denied for 10 years to any person who had been convicted more than twice of driving while intoxicated. The motorist filed a petition for review. The trial court held that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.130 (2000), the Director had 30 days to file an answer and the agency's record, and because the Director made an untimely filing, the court struck the answer and record. Because the trial court found that the denial of the motorist's license was unsupported by the evidence, the denial was set aside. The court reversed. Under the plain language of &sect; 536.130.4, it was the motorist's responsibility as plaintiff to ensure that the record was filed. The trial court erred in holding to the contrary. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150 (2000) governed the scope of judicial review, and the trial court erred in using a different scope. Because the motorist did not produce any evidence that he was entitled to a license, he failed to meet his burden of production, and the trial court erred in setting aside the denial of his license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his petition for declaratory judgment by finding: (1) the holding in abeyance of defendant's conditional release term was not a violation of due process; (2) allowing defendant's conditional release term to be consecutive to his parole term was not a violation of due process; and (3) Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.011.4 (1986) was not unconstitutional because it is vague and ambiguous. The record indicated that between December 1987 to May 1989 defendant was sentenced to: one year of imprisonment for forgery; two concurrent terms of five years of imprisonment for stealing from a person; and two years of imprisonment for stealing a motor vehicle to be served concurrently to the sentences for forgery and stealing from a person. Defendant was found guilty of robbery in the first degree in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 569.020 (1986) and armed criminal action in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.015 (1986).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant pleaded guilty to sexual abuse, kidnapping, and two counts of armed criminal action. The Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) sentenced him as a predatory sexual offender to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 15 years for the sexual abuse count and to 15 years for each of the other counts. Movant's Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.035 motion was denied without a hearing, and movant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the plea hearing, movant waived proof of facts of two unadjudicated forcible sodomies he had committed elsewhere and pleaded guilty to all four counts charged in the instant case. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court considered impact statements from the sodomy victims, and his counsel for the first time argued that the sexual predator law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.018.5 (2000) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court rejected the claim that movant's plea counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to quash the amended information charging movant as a sexual predator. The plea counsel met the standards of law that existed at the time of the guilty plea because the sexual predator law was presumed to be constitutional at that time. The court also found no due process violation in the admission of the sodomy victims' impact statements at the sentencing hearing. Movant's counsel did not object to the admission of the statements on that basis at the sentencing. Additionally, movant failed to support his claim that because he had waived proof of the prior acts, the State was precluded from presenting additional evidence of harm from the acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question on appeal was whether the trial court supervising the receivership could surcharge the SDR, who was found to have overcharged the receivership estate. The appellate court concluded that the trial court did have the jurisdiction to order the audit, and it did have the inherent power to surcharge the SDR, when the SDR had been afforded due process and discovery rights. Nevertheless, the facts created a reasonable question as to the judge's impartiality. There were extended ex parte meetings between the trial court and the auditor, and certain malpractice comments about the SDR's handling of the receivership were germane to the appearance of impropriety. The trial judge abused his discretion in refusing to recuse himself.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer filed suit in the Circuit Court of Buchanan County (Missouri). A judgment was entered in the taxpayer's favor and a refund was ordered. The assessor and collector appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the assessor and collector alleged, inter alia, that the trial court erred because the taxpayer did not exhaust its administrative remedies. The reviewing court agreed. Because the taxpayer challenged an incorrect valuation of its property, it was required to exhaust its administrative remedies and pay its taxes under protest, which it did not do. As a result, the taxpayer's claim for a refund of the excess taxes paid was barred. The taxpayer argued that it was not required to exhaust its administrative remedies and pay taxes under protest because its claim fit within the plain and ordinary meaning of the statutory language of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031.5, which allowed a taxpayer to obtain a refund if the tax was &quot;mistakenly or erroneously paid.&quot; The argument that the statute was unambiguous and the dictionary definitions were controlling was not persuasive because it was contrary to controlling case law. The taxpayer's challenge was of the type that the legislature intended to be addressed in the administrative process. Further, the taxpayer had notice of the assessed value before it paid the taxes.</SPAN></P>

The father cross-appealed the amount of the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother of the father's children requested child support enforcement services from the DCSE and requested that the DCSE seek an administrative modification to increase her child support amount. The amount was increased, at which time the father filed a petition for review and sought relief on the ground that the administrative order did not comply with certain rules. The petition was granted and a trial de novo was ordered, after which the mother dismissed her claims. The trial court awarded the father attorney fees pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.087 (2000), but the court reversed on appeal. The dismissal by the mother was of the child support modification claim pending before the trial court in a trial de novo that was ordered after the grant of the father's petition for review. Once dismissed, the father obtained a favorable judgment on her claim, and this disposition was final. The DCSE's interest, if any, in the case disappeared when the mother dismissed her claim. Because the father requested attorney fees under the statute more than 30 days after the mother's dismissal of her modification claim, the request was untimely and therefore barred.</SPAN></P>

The commission denied the application on the ground that the development did not comply with Boone County, Mo., Zoning Ordinance 15.A(2), which the trial court upheld. The court affirmed on appeal. The court rejected the developer's contention that there was no substantial evidence adduced at the hearing in opposition to the application. The residents' testimony constituted substantial evidence that the flow of traffic was going to be hindered if a permit was issued, which justified the commission's decision to deny the application. The developer failed to establish that the commission's credibility determinations were against the weight of the evidence. The developer was not entitled to relief based on an alleged delay in the commission's decision. Even if Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.830 applied, it placed no deadlines on the commission's decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), as charged by the State, of attempted statutory rape in the second degree, statutory sodomy in the second degree, statutory rape in the second degree, and forcible rape. The trial court found defendant to be a predatory sexual offender pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.018 (2000) and sentenced him accordingly. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged after his sister learned that he was sexually abusing her daughter. The jury found defendant guilty, and the trial court found that defendant forcibly raped the victim, which formed the basis for the finding that defendant was a predatory sexual offender as defined by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.018.5(2) (2000). Defendant received an enhanced sentence as a predatory sexual offender for his forcible rape conviction. On appeal, he claimed that the trial court erred in sentencing him as a predatory sexual offender because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.018 (2000) permitted one to be sentenced without the charged prior committed act being proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court rejected this argument. Given the plain and ordinary language of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.021.1 (2000), it was clear that the legislature intended that every fact essential to a determination that one was a predatory sexual offender, which necessarily included the alleged prior committed act charged under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.018.5(2) (2000), had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Because the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding beyond a reasonable doubt, there was no error.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the matter for failure to state a claim. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned unimproved property subject to the POA's declarations and purchased a watercraft for use on a lake that was common area of the POA. The landowner attempted to register the watercraft and was told to wait until the following year to do so. In the interim, the POA passed a new rule and regulation that prohibited watercraft registration without a restroom facility on a property owner's land. The POA also had a moratorium on new sewer hook-ups and denied the landowner's application. The trial court dismissed the property owner's claims on the basis that the POA did not act as an agent of the state. The appellate court initially noted to be entitled to declaratory relief, the landowner had to have a legally-protected interest, state a justiciable controversy that was ripe of adjudication, and show no adequate remedy at law. The appellate court held the landowner sufficiently pled that he had a legally-protected interest sufficient to entitle him to a declaration of his rights, but that his remaining constitutional claims were properly dismissed in the absence of state action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part; however, it was reversed and remanded to the extent it dismissed the landowner's declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

The St. Louis County Circuit Court, Missouri, ordered that the first set of cases be remanded to the Missouri Tax Commission, with directions to enter decisions in favor of the taxpayers, and ordered that the commission consider all evidence of discrimination in the second set of properties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Apartment buildings owned by the taxpayers were classified as commercial property under the &quot;rule of four&quot; definition contained in Mo.

The taxpayers claimed that they were entitled to prevail, because (1) the board's decisions had not been made by the same majority of the board; (2) some of the properties should have been classified as residential rather than commercial; and (3) the classification of all of the properties was due to an unconstitutional discrimination resulting from the lack of uniformity of assessment. The appellate court concluded the board failed to make a final determination of the appeals in any of the first set of cases, and the commission had no jurisdiction over those cases. As to whether the taxpayers failed to make a submissible case that they suffered unconstitutional discrimination under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.016.1(1), there was no evidence in the record that taxpayers' properties should have been classified as residential rather than commercial. The taxpayers' properties in the city were properly classified as commercial under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.016.1(1) and the applicable case law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in pursuit of another vehicle outside of the city limits, an officer saw defendant's vehicle speeding around a corner. Subsequently, the officer saw defendant inside his jurisdiction and motioned defendant over to his patrol car. A highway patrol officer stated that the officer could not issue defendant a ticket because the violation occurred outside his jurisdiction, but prior to the time that the officer obtained that information, he noticed that defendant's eyes were bloodshot and watery and his speech was slurred. Also, while the officer was speaking to defendant, he noticed a strong smell of alcohol on defendant's breath. Based on his observations of defendant's driving, physical appearance, and failure of two of the three field sobriety tests, the officer arrested defendant for DWI. The officer's personal observation of defendant's speeding constituted reliable information justifying the officer's later stop of defendant inside the officer's jurisdiction and defendant's speeding, combined with his indicia of intoxication, constituted probable cause to arrest defendant for DWI. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers previously filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the county and several tax districts alleging their 1997 taxes exceeded the limits of the Hancock Amendment to Mo.

After the taxpayers paid certain real and personal property taxes in 2000, they filed suit alleging the county did not use the 1999 tax rate ceiling imposed by an earlier court order; therefore, the taxes violated the Hancock Amendment. The trial court dismissed the second action for failing to follow the statutory requirements for challenging tax levies. The appellate court initially noted the purpose of the Hancock Amendment was to protect the taxpayers from an increase in the tax burden without voter approval; however, the manner of enforcement of Hancock's mandates was subject to the orderly statutory procedures. The appellate court held the failure to timely protest the payment of alleged unconstitutional taxes and to timely commence an action for the refund of such taxes was fatal, even where the challenge was based on the Hancock Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed that the city erred in ordering a forced sale, in the absence of a specific request in the pleadings. The city also failed to establish it did not have an adequate remedy at law. The city was limited to following the procedures for demolishing the building as delineated in the city code before pursuing injunctive relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the core of the declaratory judgment action was whether the governor's executive order dealing with binding arbitration in labor negotiations between state employees and executive agencies and departments, as to wages, hours, and working conditions, usurped what was a strictly legislative function and could, therefore, be declared invalid. The appellate court held that: (1) although the dismissal was without prejudice, the judgment was final and appealable, as it had the practical effect of terminating the action; (2) the allegations in the petition concerning the direct expenditure of state funds were sufficient to confer taxpayer standing to plaintiffs; (3) the executive order was not legally actionable, because there were no constitutional or statutory provisions that authorized it either specifically or by implication; (4) as there was no justiciable controversy presented in plaintiffs' case, the trial court was correct in dismissing their petition for declaratory judgment and their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim; and (5) the trial court correctly denied plaintiffs' motion to amend their petition as no new facts were brought out that could have changed the outcome.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.300 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the circuit court issued its judgment in favor of the State declaring the meaning of each provision of the Act, RHS moved to amend the judgment. The circuit court did not rule on the motion. Initially, the appellate court rejected the State's argument that it lacked jurisdiction, holding that RHS' notice of appeal was timely filed. Although RHS did not comply with Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 44.01(d) after filing its post-trial motion, it did not thereby waive or abandon entitlement to a 90 day extension on the finality of the judgment within which to file a notice of appeal, as Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 81.05 did not condition postponement of the finality of the judgment on a party following any particular procedure. Substantively, RHS contended that the circuit court erred in construing the Act to contain an exemption from liability for prohibited acts undertaken to preserve the health of the mother. The appellate court agreed, finding nothing in either the language of the Act or its limited legislative history that supported the view that the Act provided an exception to liability for actions taken to preserve the health of the mother, and reversed the circuit court's finding on that issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the declaratory judgment of the circuit court as modified.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the victims testified to their repeated abuse. A licensed psychologist testified to his opinion that defendant had two mental disorders that qualified as mental abnormalities, one of which was pedophilia. He defined pedophilia as a mental disorder. At the jury instruction conference, the trial court refused the verdict directors submitted by the state and defendant. Instead, it submitted its own following verdict director. After trial ended, however, the trial court concluded that a new trial was required so that the jury could be given the instruction tendered by defendant that contained a fifth element regarding mental abnormality. The trial court's grounds for a new trial, however, were erroneous. The appellate court agreed with the State that, because the trial court's ground for granting the trial was erroneous, the burden shifted to defendant to show that there were other errors assigned in the motion for new trial that would justify the new trial. Here, defendant relied on a new ground, error in the definition of &quot;mental abnormality.&quot; The appellate court agreed that a new trial was required, with the correct definitional instruction of &quot;mental abnormality&quot; set out.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court ordering a new trial was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction had previously been affirmed conditioned on the prosecution establishing defendant's status as a persistent offender beyond reasonable doubt. On remand, the trial court allowed the prosecution to amend the indictment to allege defendant's status. The trial court then heard evidence and found that defendant was a persistent offender, and sentenced defendant accordingly. The appellate court rejected defendant's claim that his rights against double jeopardy had been violated. Although defendant argued that the procedure prescribed by Missouri would likely be found unconstitutional in the near future, the appellate court was bound to follow the decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri in Cobb. The procedure used to impose a persistent offender sentence on defendant was proper under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.021 (Cu. Supp. 1997), and the trial court had made the findings required by the statute. The case was, however, remanded to the trial court with directions for the trial court to correct a clerical error in the written judgment which indicated that the trial court had not found defendant to be a persistent offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to a family dispute, the parents refused to allow the grandparents to visit with the minor grandchildren any more. Ultimately, the grandparents sought judicial recourse so that they could see their grandchildren. The trial court found that the grandparents had been unreasonably denied visitation. The trial court rejected the parents' claims that they restricted visitation because the grandparents refused to heed their concerns about the children's health and well-being. The parents challenged the judgment. The court of appeals held that: (1) the trial court did not lack jurisdiction to grant relief under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.402.1 (2000), since the statute required only that the 90-day period elapse before a visitation order was entered; (2) Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 452.402 (2000) was constitutional; and (3) the trial court did not err in granting unrestricted visitation, since the trial court rejected the parents' concerns as pretextual in light of the evidence that they did not restrict visitation until one of the parents became angry with his brother and the grandparents over a matter unrelated to the grandchildren's health and well-being.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations argued the trial judge failed to fulfill her ministerial duty to transfer the case to the Circuit Court of St. Louis County. The appellate court agreed. The appellate court held that, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 355.176.4 (1994) and case law precedent, the hospital where the alleged negligence occurred could only be sued in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), as: (1) the alleged cause of action accrued in St. Louis County; (2) its registered agent was located in St. Louis County; and (3) its principal place of business was located in St. Louis County. The couple contended that, because of an affiliation agreement between the three corporations, the hospital was an agent of the other two corporations. The appellate court held that the affiliation agreement was intended for business reasons and not to assert control or right to control over medical care, nor did the couple allege any specific negligence against the other two corporations. The appellate court also agreed with the corporations that the trial judge erroneously granted the couples' request to conduct venue discovery related to agency and/or joint business venture issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens passed a sewage and water revenue bond and Sullivan, Mo. City Ordinance No. 2581 (1999), was enacted providing for the payment of connection fees to the new sewerage system. Residents were charged $ 3,750 for a gravity connection or $ 4,250 for a grinder pump connection. Prior to the ordinance, the connection fee was $ 75 for the old system. The residents argued that the fee imposed constituted a fee subject to the Hancock Amendment, and therefore the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was not approved by a majority of the voters. The appellate court considered five factors which were to be considered in determining whether a fee increase was a &quot;tax, license or fee&quot; requiring voter approval under the Hancock Amendment, and concluded the fees were not subject to the Hancock Amendment. The appellate court also held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 250.233 (Cum. Supp. 1999) plainly stated that charges for sewer services, including tap-on or connection fees, could be imposed in addition to charges collected for maintenance and repair of a sewage system, and there was substantial evidence that the increased fee was not an arbitrary or capricious exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

The inmate then filed this action, and the Board was granted summary judgment. The trial court erred in determining that the inmate's claims were barred by res judicata. Because the habeas corpus petitions were summarily dismissed, res judicata did not bar the claims. However, the court affirmed the ruling in favor of the Board, as the inmate's argument was based on a misunderstanding of the statute. When the inmate filed his action, he had not yet reached his conditional release date. Thus, he was not entitled to have &sect; 558.011 applied. He was released on parole, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 217.690 (2000), before his release date. The Board retained the authority to supervise him until the entire sentence expired. The board's discretion to return the inmate to prison was not affected by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 558.011 (2000).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Platte County, Missouri, granted respondent pipeline company, the easement owner, an injunction restraining appellants, the past and present landowners and the entity directing the landfill, from placing additional fill on the property and ordering removal of the fill from within 50 feet of the centerline of the pipelines. The appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellants challenged the judgment below contending that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to order equitable relief because there was an adequate remedy at law, condemnation; because all necessary and indispensable parties were not joined in the action; and because the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin those appellants with no ownership interest in the property subject to the easement. The appellate court found that appellants misconceived the nature of the action and the relief granted. The pipeline company's action sought to define the proper scope of the easement based on past use, not to broaden it, and the judgment in effect declared that the company had a 100-foot wide fixed easement based on the original placement of the pipelines. Thus, appellants' major premise, that the circuit court had effected a taking by changing a 30-foot easement into a 100-foot easement, was misplaced. The court also found that all parties necessary to enjoin encroachment on the easement were before the circuit court and that those appellants without an ownership interest in the property were persons in active concert or participation with the encroachment on the easement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, denied appellant student's request for injunctive relief against appellee Missouri State High School Activities Association from enforcing a bylaw prohibiting students from competing on both a school and a non-school team in the same sport during the school team's season. The student appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student argued that the association's by-law 235 was against public policy because it was arbitrary, capricious and violated her Constitutional rights to equal protection and free association as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The student maintained that the prohibition of simultaneous same-sport competition was irrational and unrelated to any legitimate goal of the association. The appellate court found that its inquiry was confined to whether there was a rational relationship between by-law 235 and any legitimate interest of the association. There were reasonable grounds for by-law 235 because a reasonable person could believe that a legitimate goal of the association was furthered by the rule. It was not in the best interest of the majority of high school students to compete in the same sport at the same time on two different teams. There was substantial evidence to conclude that the by-law was rationally related to the legitimate goal of protecting the best interest of the larger number of high school students. There was no First Amendment right for a high school student to associate simultaneously with both a school and a non-school swim team.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 491.015 (1994), Missouri's rape shield statute, was not applicable because he was not attempting to show that the victim had engaged in prior sexual activity, but that the victim had made allegations of sexual assaults that had not occurred. Defendant asserted this was a permissible challenge to the victim's veracity. The appellate court found that the statute did not preclude introduction of evidence of prior allegations by an alleged sexual abuse victim if that evidence was offered to impeach the credibility of the victim as a witness. However, there were more witnesses to defendant's acts than a single victim. All four girls witnessed the sexual acts committed and testified accordingly. The testimony of each girl was consistent with the testimony of the others. Even if the evidence was erroneously excluded, defendant was not prejudiced by its exclusion. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request for mistrial. Testimony that was contrary to defendant's pre-trial motion in limine was not prejudicial. Defendant did not preserve his argument of improper comments by the prosecutor for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner owned one-story commercial-type garage constructed of concrete blocks that the property owner used for storage. The garage was inspected on February 11. During the initial inspection, the inspector took photographs and completed a Dangerous Building Evaluation Form and a Feasibility Analysis Report. Subsequent inspections occurred on March 28 and July 12, with additional photographs being taken. On February 25, pursuant to Kansas City, Mo., Prop. Maint. Code &sect; 56-533(3), an order was issued to demolish the garage based upon the findings that the garage was a dangerous building, as defined in Kansas City, Mo., Prop. Maint. Code &sect; 56-532(a), and that the garage was damaged to a degree that it was not economically feasible to rehabilitate it. The appellate court held that, as the written findings by the inspector were conclusory and did not set forth the specific conditions or defects found by the inspector making it dangerous and requiring its demolition, the matter needed to be remanded back to the local agency to make the appropriate findings.</SPAN></P>
