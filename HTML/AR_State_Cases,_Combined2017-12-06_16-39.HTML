Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-105(a), because they fell within the coverage formula of the Act, even though the decedent was ultimately denied recovery due to his asbestos claim being time-barred under the Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-702(a)(2)(B); [2]-The Act covered occupational diseases and provided coverage, and thus a remedy, for asbestos-related claims, Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-9-601(a) and (g)(1)(B) and 11-9-702(a)(2)(B); [3]-Section 11-9-702(a)(2)(B) represented a policy-driven, legislative judgment to shield an employer from claims that arise three years after the last injurious exposure.</SPAN></P>

P. 37.1 because appellant did not provide any factual or legal basis in support of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to litigating the issue raised in the motion for a new trial either before the trial court or on appeal; [2]-The new-trial motion and lack of an order denying it was wholly irrelevant to the outcome of the appeal, and the motion did not create new issues that were ripe for appellate review that had been waived by appellate counsel; [3]-Appellant failed to allege or to provide sufficient argument establishing that an objection was made during the prosecutor's closing remarks, the trial court erred in its ruling on the issue, and an argument concerning the issue could have been raised on appeal to merit appellate relief.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) because an employee failed to state facts that would entitle him to relief under the Arkansas Whistle-Blower Act (AWBA), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 21-1-603 (2004), and that would constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity under that statute; [3]-The employee's complaint did not identify any conduct attributable to the university's board of trustees that violated the AWBA; [4]-Therefore, no exception to sovereign immunity existed, and the suit was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity as set forth in Ark.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">ISSUE: Whether a natural-gas compressor station operator was entitled to prohibit a circuit court from conducting proceedings on a complaint filed by landowners. HOLDINGS: [1]-The owners properly filed their action in the county of the operator. The circuit court had jurisdiction over the subject matter, and personal jurisdiction was not in dispute because the lawsuit was brought in the principal place of business of the operator; [2]-In their complaint, the owners stated sufficient facts to support venue in the county by asserting that the operator's principal place of business rested in the county. Thus, the circuit court properly confined its review to the pleadings and properly ruled on the operator's motion to dismiss; [3]-The operator was not entitled to a writ of prohibition because it failed to demonstrate that the county was wholly without jurisdiction on the issue of venue.</SPAN></P>

Acts 1116 (Act 1116) did not require that an order vacating the judgment be set aside because Act 1116 could not apply retroactively to the case as it created a new, substantive right; [3]-Putting third-party defendant doctor on the verdict form was not harmless because the physicians were allowed to file Ark. R. Civ. P. 14 third-party complaints less than two weeks before trial, prejudicing appellee representative, the jury was wrongly instructed on those complaints, and the jury was told the representative had to show the doctor's negligence when the physicians had the burden to prove this affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

Const. amend. 80, &sect; 16(B), due to not being licensed to practice law for the six years preceding taking office, because he remained licensed when his privilege to practice law was suspended, since his license was not terminated and his name was not removed from the list of licensed attorneys; [2]-Ark. R. Admis. Bar VII(C) (2013) was unconstitutional to the extent it provided for the automatic suspension of a lawyer's license without procedural due process because it deprived a lawyer of a protected property right to pursue his or her profession without notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 4, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2, because the general assembly did not provide this remedy, the ASBEC created a procedure that did not exist, and the legislature did not intend for it to exist, so, by promulgating the rules, the ASBEC was improperly legislating.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant construction company sought review of orders from the Faulkner Circuit Court (Arkansas), which dismissed its complaint against appellee homeowners alleging breach of contract, unjust enrichment or quantum meruit, promissory estoppel, and fraud or misrepresentation based on the homeowners' failure to disclose the inadequacy of financing for the construction of their residence. The circuit court awarded attorneys' fees to the homeowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Previous litigation between the parties had resulted in an agreed order to discharge a materialman's lien. In their motion to dismiss, the homeowners asserted the grounds of res judicata, failure to strictly comply with notice requirements for a lien, and failure to plead facts establishing a claim for fraud or misrepresentation. The circuit court based its ruling on the sole ground that the contractor's failure to strictly comply with notice requirements for a lien barred its action under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 18-44-115(a)(4) (Supp. 2011). Although the contractor had argued that the sale was a direct sale exempt from the notice requirement under &sect; 18-44-115(a)(8)(A), (B), the circuit court's order did not expressly address this issue. The court held that the contractor's failure to obtain express rulings from the circuit court precluded appellate review as to the direct-sale exemption, constitutional arguments, res judicata, and fraud. Thus, the court was precluded from reaching the merits of the arguments raised in the contractor's appeal, except for an attorneys' fees argument that was rendered without merit by the court's summary affirmance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the orders of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant juvenile was convicted of capital-murder and aggravated-robbery.

The United States Supreme Court held that Arkansas' sentencing scheme violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments as it pertained to juveniles.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court erred by denying appellant juvenile's petition for writ of habeas corpus; because he was only fourteen years old when he committed capital-murder and aggravated-robbery, his mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole violated the Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII. In considering the capital-murder statute as it pertained to juveniles, the Supreme Court of Arkansas severed portions of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-101(c) which provided that capital murder was punishable by death or life imprisonment without parole. For juveniles convicted of capital murder, the punishment had to fit the sentencing range for a Class Y felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A juvenile was convicted by a jury in the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) of capital murder and aggravated robbery. He received a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole for his capital-murder conviction pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-101(c) (Supp. 2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile, age 17, planned the robbery after learning that the victim was coming to the juvenile's family home and had received a significant amount of money from a tax refund. The juvenile and another juvenile attempted to rob the victim outside the residence; the other juvenile killed the victim. Following sentencing, the U.S. Supreme Court held that U.S. Const. amend. VIII prohibited a mandatory life without parole sentence for juvenile offenders in homicide cases, and that a judge or jury must have the opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before imposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles. The court agreed with the State that it should sever the unconstitutional language in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-101(c) as applied to juveniles convicted of capital murder. The juvenile should be resentenced under the discretionary range for a Class Y felony, as provided in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-401(a)(1) (Repl. 2006), and a sentencing hearing was required in which the juvenile could present for the jury's consideration any mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant police officer sought review of an order from the Prairie County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which denied his motion for judgment on the pleadings in an action by appellee for violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the Arkansas Constitution, and the Arkansas Civil Rights Act (ACRA), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-123-105 (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officer arrested appellee for disorderly conduct and refusal to submit to arrest. She was convicted in district court. The circuit court overturned the disorderly-conduct conviction. She brought an action against the officer in federal court. The federal court dismissed the case. She then brought an action against the officer in state court. The circuit court denied the officer's motion for judgment on the pleadings. On appeal, the court found that the issue of excessive force was the same in both causes of action, was actually litigated, and was determined by a valid and final judgment in the federal court. The federal court also resolved appellee's claim that the city had in place a policy or custom permitting officers to use excessive force to make an arrest. The issue of whether the officer violated her right to remonstrate was not resolved by the federal court, so she was not barred from raising the issue in state court. However, the lack of precedent alone made it clear that her right to remonstrate, as she understood it, was not clearly established at the time of her arrest. Accordingly, the officer was entitled to qualified immunity on the right-to-remonstrate claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that the circuit court erred in holding her in contempt because she complied with the visitation order after the first week and she refused visitation only one time when the grandmother allegedly did not have an appropriate car seat. The supreme court disagreed. The order granted the grandmother visitation while the mother was at work on weekdays from 4:45 p.m. to 7:45 p.m. The order permitted alteration of the schedule to weekend visitation should the mother's working hours change. The testimony established that the grandmother did not receive visitation on the Friday or Saturday after the visitation order was entered and that she was denied scheduled visits the following week. Although the mother testified that her work schedule had changed, the grandmother testified that she observed the mother's car at work during the hours when visitation was to occur. Therefore, the circuit court's finding of contempt was not clearly against the preponderance of the evidence. Additionally, a portion of the attorney's fee was improper because a review of the time sheet showed that counsel included hours devoted to the adoption proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment as to visitation rights following the adoption and a portion of the attorney's fees was reversed and remanded. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer pulled appellant over due to a severely cracked windshield. He was cited for driving without a license, and his motion to suppress was denied. He entered a conditional guilty plea, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court determined that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 27-32-101 concerned more than just mechanical deficiencies. Under the facts of this case, a windshield with a crack running from roof post to roof post across the driver's field of vision was the type of &quot;safety defect&quot; contemplated by &sect; 27-32-101(a)(2)(A). There were facts and circumstances within the officer's knowledge that were sufficient to permit a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense had been committed by appellant. There was nothing to suggest that the stop was based on profiling. The supreme court deferred to the trial court's determination of witness credibility, and the picture of the windshield showed a crack that ran completely across the vehicle from roof post to roof post. It appeared to be in a position that would obstruct a driver's vision and impair the structural integrity of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff school district sought declaratory judgment against defendant county, arguing that the county improperly applied a portion of a property tax increase to the retirement of redevelopment-district bonds. The Washington County Circuit Court (Arkansas) granted the school district's motion for summary judgment, finding that the tax collector improperly applied a portion of the tax increase to the redevelopment district. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Voters passed 2.75 new-debt-service mills that would, according to the ballot, be a continuing debt service tax until the retirement of proposed school bonds for $ 51 million. The school district argued that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-168-301(18)(B)(i) (Supp. 2011) excluded from the definition of &quot;total ad valorem rate&quot; any increases in the total millage rate occurring after the creation of the redevelopment district if the additional millage was pledged for repayment of a specific bond issue. Therefore, the county erred in including these 2.75 mills in the total ad valorem rate and in applying a portion of them to the redevelopment district. The court agreed, rejecting the city's argument that &sect; 14-168-301(18)(B)(i) impaired the bond-purchase contract and bond financing in violation of Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17, because the 2.75-millage increase had not been passed at the time the redevelopment bonds were authorized. Further, the official statement for the redevelopment bonds warned investors of the risk that legislation might restrict millages to be included in the applicable ad valorem rate. The ballot for the 2.75 mills clearly stated that they were for repayment of the school bonds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by striking the hospital's third-party complaint against the rehabilitation center because the hospital did not have a cause of action against the rehabilitation center under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-55-201 as it did not create a cause of action. The court held that the hospital did not have a right of contribution under the Uniform Contribution among  Tortfeasors Act (UCATA) because the hospital and the rehabilitation center were not joint tortfeasors under the UCATA, as there was only several liability following the enactment of the Civil Justice Reform Act of 2003 (CJRA). Because the hospital did not have a cause of action against the rehabilitation center, the hospital's argument that it was entitled to file a third-party complaint under Ark. R. Civ. P. 14 was also without merit, as the hospital did not have a right of contribution against the rehabilitation center. The trial court did not err by finding that the rehabilitation center was not a necessary or indispensable party under Ark. R. Civ. P. 19 because its presence was not indispensable to the determination of the hospital's separate liability under the CJRA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon stopping defendant and boarding his boat to perform a safety check, a sergeant with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission concluded that he was under the influence of alcohol. The sergeant arrested him, and he was charged with boating while intoxicated. Defendant entered a no-contest plea in a district court. The circuit court overturned his conviction. On review, the court found that granting a law enforcement officer the unfettered right to stop and check a vessel at will removed the requirement under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. IV, that the stop must be reasonable under the circumstances. The sergeant testified that, while he tried to stop and perform a safety check on as many vessels as he could in a given day, there was no plan and nothing to determine which boats he stopped. There were no specific, objective facts about defendant's vessel to indicate that society's legitimate interests required the seizure of defendant and his particular vessel. Defendant's vessel was being legally operated in an unremarkable fashion. The safety-check stops violated the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was employed by a staffing company and had been contracted to work at a rubber company when his right hand was caught under the cutting blade of a profiling machine. He brought an action against the consulting company, claiming it was negligent when consulting with the rubber company on safety-compliance issues. A jury found that appellant was a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the consulting company and the rubber company, but that the consulting company was not negligent and did not breach its contract. On appeal, the court found that although appellant filed a motion in limine challenging the admission of evidence or argument of non-party fault, the trial court's ruling did not address the specific constitutional arguments raised on appeal. Further, he failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the empty-chair defense. He did not object when the empty-chair defense and evidence were being presented and did not obtain a ruling that the trial court's prior ruling on his motion in limine was being violated. Appellant himself insinuated the fault of the rubber company when he elicited testimony of a subsequent remedial measure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An air-ambulance helicopter was involved in an accident after picking up an accident victim. The flight nurse and the EMT brought a negligence action against the pilot. The parties all worked for the employer, the owner of the helicopter. The pilot filed a motion to dismiss, claiming he was immune from suit under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-105 (2012). The Commission adopted an administrative law judge's finding that, at the time of the accident, the pilot was performing the employer's duty to provide a safe work place for the nurse and EMT and was therefore entitled to immunity. The court of appeals upheld the decision. On review, the court found that the Commission's decision was supported by substantial evidence. It was undisputed that the pilot was neither the nurse or EMT's supervisor nor their employer or employee. The record demonstrated that he was a co-employee charged with the employer's duty to provide a safe workplace. His sole responsibility was to operate the workplace, a roving helicopter, in a safe manner and to safely transport patients. The interpretation of &sect; 11-9-105 extending immunity to co-employees did not contravene Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>

The inmate filed motions for the appointment of counsel and to supplement the record with additional exhibits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was serving a life sentence. He filed a complaint against appellees, seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, costs, and attorney fees against appellees for civil-rights violations, and relief as a taxpayer for an illegal exaction based on claims concerning the procedures for submission of applications for clemency. The trial court granted appellees' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. On appeal, the court found that the inmate failed to plead any facts to establish that the statutes that the Arkansas Parole Board and Department of Correction used in determining the procedures, as applied to his submissions, for submitting requests for clemency, Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5-4-607 &amp;16-93-207 (2006), were punitive in nature. He therefore failed under Ark. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(1) to plead a basis to support his claim of an ex post facto violation, and it was not error for the trial court to find that no ex post facto violation had been set out in the complaint. Further, he did not plead facts that would demonstrate, if proven, that there was a state action that differentiated among individuals seeking clemency without a rational basis for the classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the inmate's motions to supplement exhibits and for counsel. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The parents cross-appealed the circuit court's order reducing the jury's verdict from $20 million to $11 million.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A surgeon employed by University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) had operated on the wrong side of the son's brain. The surgery was performed at the Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH). The court concluded that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to submit non-model jury instructions that would have required the jury to apportion liability to parties who were not defendants in the case. The court noted that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-55-201 (Repl. 2011) plainly provides that liability is to be apportioned with regard to &quot;each defendant.&quot; The circuit court properly instructed the jury not to attribute any fault of the UAMS physicians to ACH and to allocate the fault of ACH only to the insurer. Although the insurer argued the circuit court erred in excluding deposition testimony of appellees' medical expert, the court could find nowhere in the record where the insurer ever attempted to introduce such testimony and where the circuit court ruled that it was inadmissible. The circuit court did not err in reducing the jury's verdict to $11 million. There was one single medical incident, the surgery on the son's brain, that resulted in his damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant citizen sought review of an order entered by the Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which dismissed his action against appellees, a city, its administrator, members of the city's board of directors, and others, regarding alleged violations of the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 25-19-101 to 25-19-110 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2011). Appellees were also granted declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrator, prior to a board study session, prepared a memorandum and draft ordinance relating to the administrator's hire-and-fire authority and provided the documents to individual board members. Appellant claimed that such conduct violated the FOIA provision in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-19-106 regarding open meetings. Appellees sought declaratory relief with respect to the constitutionality of the FOIA. The circuit court found that no violation of the FOIA had occurred and that Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 25-19-104 and 25-19-106 were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed that no violation of &sect; 25-19-106 occurred because the administrator had only provided information to the individual board members rather than trying to solicit votes for his proposal. However, the court reversed the determination of the constitutionality of the noted FOIA provisions because declaratory relief was inappropriate under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-111-104 (2006) as appellees did not yet have a case or controversy ready for decision by the courts. Appellees received a legal opinion rather than resolution of an actual controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, an education commissioner, a department of education, and a state treasurer, challenged a decision from the Pulaski County Circuit Court, Arkansas, which, inter alia, enjoined them from seeking repayment of any portion of a twenty-five-mill uniform rate of tax (URT) revenues levied and assessed for school funding from appellee school districts. A cross-appeal was also filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that appellants were not authorized to recoup and redistribute any URT revenues received from school districts that were in excess of the foundation-funding amount. It also held that appellants lacked authority to withhold monies from the school districts based on the submission of allegedly deficient budgets. However, the trial court held that the revenues generated by the URT were state-tax revenues. On review, the supreme court held that appellants were not authorized to distribute the excess funds to another school district under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-80-101(b)(1)(B). Allowing the school districts to retain any URT revenues in excess of foundation funding resulted in variations, which were contemplated and permitted by Ark. Const. art. 14, &sect; 3(a). Next, the excess funds did not constitute an overpayment whereby the remedies set forth in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 6-20-2306 could have been utilized. The school districts' budget were not deficient, and the withholding of categorical funds from the school districts on this basis was error. However, the trial court erred in its conclusion that URT revenues were state-tax revenues; rather, it was a school-district tax.</SPAN></P>

The owner counterclaimed, challenging the validity and constitutionality of the city's ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses. The Johnson County Circuit Court (Arkansas) granted the city's motion for summary judgment; the owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner operated for three years as a nonconforming sexually oriented business, and once the challenged ordinance's three-year grace period ended, it applied for and received a single six-month hardship extension pursuant to the ordinance. The trial court held that the doctrines of waiver and estoppel prohibited the owner from challenging the ordinance because it sought and was granted a hardship license and because it had received the benefit of the ordinance's amortization period. The high court disagreed. The ordinance provided no benefits to the owner, only burdens. As violating the ordinance would subject the owner to criminal sanctions, its acceptance of the temporary hardship extension could not be considered voluntary. The owner was not estopped from challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance because its store was in already in operation when the ordinance was enacted, and the owner was not seeking to retain the benefits of the ordinance while at the same time seeking to rid itself of its burdens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for the trial court to decide the merits of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, opponents of a ballot measure, brought an original action requesting the court to review the legal sufficiency of the measure's popular name and ballot title after respondent, the Arkansas Secretary of State, certified the popular name and ballot title to be placed on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The measure was described, in a lengthy ballot title, as making the use of marijuana for medical purposes legal under state law and establishing standards for such use. The popular name included the phrase &quot;medical marijuana.&quot; The court found the ballot title sufficient under Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 1 (amended by Ark. Const. amend. 7) because it informed the voters in an intelligible, honest, and impartial manner of the substantive matter of the act. Although lengthy, the title was not unduly long, nor was it complex or misleading. The ballot title did not have to include every detail, term, definition, or possible consequence of the act. The popular name sufficiently conveyed to voters the topic of medicinal use of marijuana and was not misleading, partisan, or defective. Substantive constitutional challenges to the act raised issues that were not ripe for review, and the opponents' hypothetical scenarios describing possible consequences of the act did not show that the act clearly conflicted with any constitutional provisions or that it was clearly contrary to any state or federal laws. Therefore, inclusion of the act on the ballot was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied the petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the Arkansas Department of Correction (ADC) and its director, and appellees, a group of several prisoners awaiting execution on Arkansas's death row, appealed from an order of the Pulaski County Circuit Court, Arkansas, granting in part and denying in part cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoners asserted, inter alia, that the Method of Execution Act of 2009 (MEA), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-617 (Supp. 2011), was an unconstitutional violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine. The court declared the entirety of the MEA unconstitutional. It was evident that the legislature abdicated its responsibility and passed to the ADC the unfettered discretion to determine all protocol and procedures, most notably the chemicals to be used, for a state execution. The MEA failed to provide reasonable guidelines for the selection of chemicals to be used during lethal injection and it failed to provide any general policy with regard to the lethal-injection procedure. Injunctive relief was not proper. The prisoners prayed for an injunction to prevent the ADC from using sodium thiopental it obtained from a British vendor to execute the prisoners. Because all the sodium thiopental obtained from the vendor had been destroyed and could not again be obtained from that source, these prisoners no longer ran the risk of being executed with sodium thiopental obtained from the vendor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the circuit court's order to the extent it declared Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-617&nbsp;unconstitutional and found that certain claims presented by the prisoners were moot. It reversed the circuit court's order striking language from the statute and granting injunctive relief. The court remanded in part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants caused a writ of garnishment to be issued to reach assets held in an IRA account. Appellants argued that the exemption provided in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-66-220(a)(1) conflicted with Ark. Const. art. 9, &sect; 2, because the statute provided a personal property exemption in excess of the $500 personal property exemption referred to in the Constitution. The court held that the IRA exemption provided in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-66-220(a)(1) was not an absolute exemption of all personal property, and as such, did not offend Ark. Const. art. 9, &sect; 2. As long as the exemption at issue was not an absolute exemption of all personal property, but instead related only to exempting certain funds from general garnishment statutes, then the exemption did not violate Ark.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother appealed from an order denying her petition to terminate guardianship.

Therefore, the application of &sect; 28-65-401 violated the mother's constitutional right. The circuit court also failed to make the appropriate finding required by Ark. R. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A juvenile was charged in Jefferson County Circuit Court (Arkansas) with capital murder, three counts of aggravated robbery, first-degree escape, theft of property, and second-degree battery. The juvenile filed a motion to dismiss and to declare Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-318&nbsp;unconstitutional and a motion to transfer to juvenile court. After a hearing, the circuit court entered an order denying both motions. The juvenile appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-318, which vested prosecuting attorneys with the discretion to bring felony charges against sixteen-year-olds in the criminal divisions of circuit courts, was substantive law that was rooted in public policy and not a rule of pleading, practice, and procedure; therefore, the statute did not violate separation of powers under Ark. Const. art. 4, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. Also, &sect; 9-27-318(c) did not deny the juvenile equal protection of the law. Treatment as a juvenile was not an inherent right but one granted by the state legislature. Due to the well-documented rise in the violent crime rate among juveniles in recent years, the legislature was authorized to restrict or qualify the right of treatment as a juvenile by making the option of trying juveniles as adults available to the State. The circuit court did not err in denying the motion to transfer under the factors in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-318(g). The juvenile had an extensive record, and he brutally ambushed and murdered a guard before escaping from a juvenile facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision to try the juvenile as an adult.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that the circuit court's denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus was clearly erroneous. The petitioner's argument concerning the description of the crime contained in the information was, essentially, that the State failed to provide sufficient information to allow the petitioner to identify the crime with which he was charged. This type of claim was not cognizable in a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Also, the circuit court did not need to consider the petitioner's claim that he was never charged as a habitual offender, because the petition failed to demonstrate probable cause to believe that the petitioner's sentence was illegal. The petitioner's sentence was within the statutory range, irrespective of any enhancement as a habitual offender, and a sentence that was within the prescribed range was not illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant law firm sued appellees, several doctors, an attorney, and a hospital, alleging a violation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), specifically Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-19-105. The Saline County Circuit Court, Arkansas, held that the documents were not subject to disclosure under the FOIA. The court entered an order granting the law firm's motion to dismiss its complaint; however, counterclaims remanded pending. The law firm appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When a law firm nonsuited its FOIA claim against several doctors, an attorney, and a hospital, the circuit court did not err in permitting appellees to move forward on their counterclaim for declaratory relief. Under Ark. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(3), a defendant had the right to pursue a counterclaim even though the plaintiff had dismissed his original claim. The circuit court did not err in holding that the FOIA was not applicable, because the documents requested were not public records subject to the FOIA. The litigation file requested was created by an attorney hired by private medical malpractice liability insurance carriers and made in the course of representing doctors sued in their personal capacity; simply changing the records request to name the doctors in their official capacity did not convert the documents from private to public for purposes of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-19-105(a)(1)(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer began withholding a portion of wages from the employee's paycheck as the result of an income-withholding order received from a county located in the State of California. The employee argued that under the statutory scheme, once he filed an objection all deductions should have stopped until the county could prove the validity of its right to obtain income withholding. The reviewing court held that the circuit court correctly held that the employee was barred from bringing the instant suit against the employer. The applicable statutory scheme required the employer to comply with the withholding order, and by doing so, it could not be held civilly liable. The county was not required to register the income-withholding order because it decided to send the withholding order directly to the employer, as allowed under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-17-501. Also, there was no merit to the argument that the statutory scheme violated Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 13. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-17-506(a) (2009) allowed the employee a way to seek redress in the event the support order was defective. Furthermore, the circuit court was correct to dismiss the action with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The business argued that because it was under the threat of imminent prosecution, there was a justiciable controversy warranting declaratory relief.

The business sought a declaration that its conduct was legal and not subject to prosecution, and courts did not sit for the purpose of determining speculative and abstract questions of law or laying down rules for future conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The subsidiary publicly solicited and later accepted the contractor's bids for the construction of a twelve-mile, natural-gas pipeline. The contractor alleged that it had provided substantial amounts of labor and materials for the project, and that the subsidiary terminated the contracts. The subsidiary argued that the contractor was barred from asserting claims for breach of contract and a violation of the ADTPA, because the contractor failed to obtain a contractor's license from the Arkansas Contractors Licensing Board. The reviewing court held that the contractor's construction of a natural-gas pipeline wherein space was leased fell squarely within the ambit of the statutory definition of contractor in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-25-101(a)(1). Also, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-25-103(d) did not violate Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 13. The statute did not abrogate the right of all contractors to bring suit, but denied that right only to those contractors who did not possess a license. As designed to protect the public, the statute advanced the goal of providing an incentive for contractors to undergo the licensing process to ensure that the standards set by the licensing board were satisfied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought review of an order from the Lonoke County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which denied their Ark.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of methamphetamine, and possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver. The trial court denied their petitions for postconviction relief. On appeal, the court found that possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to manufacture methamphetamine was not a lesser-included offense of manufacturing methamphetamine, in violation of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-101(m). Hence, defense counsel was not ineffective for not objecting that defendants' convictions for both charges violated double jeopardy under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-110(b) (Supp. 2011). Further, the court found no merit to defendants' claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the constitutionality and effect of the 70 percent law, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-93-611 (2006), that was applied in their case via a jury instruction. The status of their parole eligibility was immaterial to whether the decision reached by the jury would have been different absent the alleged errors, which was the standard under Strickland.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, inmate and brother, challenged the order of the Newton County Circuit Court, Arkansas, reviving a 1999 decree and denying their motion for summary judgment, in the action with appellees, wife's siblings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1991, shortly after the inmate was convicted of murdering his wife and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, he executed a warranty deed conveying property to his brother. In 1990, the inmate had been sued by the siblings for wrongful death, which resulted in the entry of default judgment against the inmate in the amount of $1,350,000. In 1999, the trial court entered a decree finding that the conveyance had been fraudulent, and in 2009, the siblings filed a petition for writ of scire facias to revive the 1999 decree. The reviewing could held that the 1999 decree was entitled to the same footing as a judgment, and the circuit court did not err in concluding that it could be revived by a writ of scire facias under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-65-501. Also, the circuit court did not err in finding that the siblings timely revived the 1999 decree where they filed their writ of scire facias on May 13, 2009, within ten years from May 25, 1999, the effective date of the decree. Furthermore, appellants failed to preserve for review their assertion that the circuit court's 2011 order was vague, ambiguous, and lacked specific findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted after a jury trial in the Washington County Circuit Court (Arkansas) of four counts of second-degree sexual assault in violation of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-125(a)(6) (Supp. 2009) and one count of witness bribery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a high school teacher who engaged in a consensual sexual relationship with an 18-year-old student. Another student testified that, prior to charges being filed, defendant approached him and told him to tell the victim that he would give her money if she would drop the case. This evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for witness bribery under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-53-108(a)(1) (Repl. 2005). The court held, however, that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-125(a)(6) (Supp. 2009), as applied to a high school teacher who engaged in a consensual sexual relationship with an 18-year-old student, who was an adult under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-25-101(a) (Repl. 2009), infringed on the teacher's fundamental right to privacy and was not the least restrictive method available for the promotion of the State's interest; therefore, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and dismissed the convictions for sexual assault in the second degree. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion for directed verdict on the witness bribery charge but reversed as to the trial court's exclusion of evidence of bias of a witness and remanded as to that charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff city filed an eminent domain complaint against defendant landowner in the Washington County Circuit Court (Arkansas). The city also filed a motion for an order of immediate possession pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 18-15-303, which was granted. The city entered the property and commenced construction. The landowner filed a notice of interlocutory appeal; upon his payment of a bond, the immediate possession order was stayed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court had granted the order of immediate possession after a hearing at which it determined that the city had the right to take the property for a bicycle trail under Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 14-269-103, 18-15-201, and 18-15-301. The court held that because the issue of just compensation remained to be determined in the circuit court, the circuit court's order was not a final, appealable order. The court rejected the landowner's contention that failure to hear the appeal would divest him of a substantial right in such a manner as to put it beyond the power of the court to place him in his former condition. The easement for the bicycle trail did not bisect the property, but ran along its edge. The landowner produced no evidence that commencing construction of the trail would render it impossible to restore his property to its previous condition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The adoptive parents filed a petition for adoption. The putative father filed a complaint in intervention. The trial court determined that the father's consent to the adoption was not required. The trial court granted the adoption. On appeal, the court held that the birth mother clearly thwarted the father's efforts to comply with Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-9-206(a)(2) (2009). The father took steps to form a significant custodial, personal, or financial relationship with the child. He not only filed with the putative-father registries in four states but also filed paternity actions in both Texas and Arkansas. He provided some support to the mother during the pregnancy and established an account for the support of the baby. He did not furnish financial support to the mother after she left Missouri, but she refused to inform him of her specific location. His efforts to establish a significant custodial, personal, or financial relationship, in light of the mother's thwarting of his efforts, were sufficient such that his consent to the adoption was required pursuant to &sect; 9-9-206(a)(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A criminal case alleged that appellee corporation had violated two city ordinances. The trial court entered an order interpreting Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-266-105(a), even though the city no longer had a franchise agreement for ambulance service. The trial court found that the issue was capable of repetition, yet evading review, because the city could have entered into such an agreement with an entity other than the corporation sometime in the future. This appeal followed. In dismissing, the supreme court determined that, because the specific ordinances at issue had been repealed, the issue of whether the corporation was subject to those ordinances was moot, unless one of the two exceptions to mootness applied. No exception to the mootness doctrine allowed review in this case. Moreover, any opinion handed down based on repealed ordinances and a nonexisting franchise procedure would have been simply an advisory opinion. Because the case was moot when the trial court heard it in 2011, the trial court's decision was also advisory and had no effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeal was dismissed, and the case was remanded with directions for the entry of an order by the trial court relating to mootness.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 20-10-1204(a)(21) (2005).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The representative brought a suit against appellants, asserting that the decedent's caregivers at the nursing home were negligent in their treatment of a pressure sore on her coccyx and caused it to worsen. A jury awarded judgment to the representative. On appeal the court held that the trial court erred in denying a directed-verdict motion filed by the president because he owed no personal duty to the decedent. The trial court erred in granting a motion in limine during appellants' opening statement to exclude the decedent's postdischarge medical evidence. The excluded evidence related to the continued progression of the sore, as well as the development of additional, similar wounds that the decedent developed following her time at the nursing home. By excluding the evidence, which was relevant under Ark. R. Evid. 401, the trial court allowed appellants to, at the last minute, be stripped of an entire defense that had been clearly developed throughout the litigation to the full knowledge of the representative. The trial court erred in permitting the representative's expert to testify as to the meaning of dignity, as used in &sect; 20-10-1204(a)(21), because the word was not complex.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, dismissed the president from the action, and remanded the case for a new trial on the claims against the corporation and the leasing company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the Union County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which convicted him of capital murder, in violation of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-101(a)(1)(B) (Supp. 2011), residential burglary, and theft of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of capital murder, residential burglary, and theft of property. On appeal, he claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because the State failed to adequately corroborate his confession and the testimony of his accomplice. The court found that there was substantial evidence to support the convictions. The State presented evidence that the murder victim died at the hands of another, that a second victim's home was burglarized, and that guns were removed from the second victim's home. Thus, the State offered evidence to corroborate defendant's confession under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-89-111(d) (2005) by establishing that the crimes were committed. In turn, defendant's professed participation in the crimes, as well as a photograph of defendant and his accomplice at a convenience store just prior to the criminal activity, provided evidence tending to connect him with the commission of the offenses. Defendant's claim that the capital murder statute and the first-degree murder statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-102(a)(1)(A)-(B) (2006), were unconstitutionally vague was not preserved for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff patient appealed a decision by the Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas) that entered summary judgment in favor of defendant doctors in her medical malpractice action; the patient claimed that the trial court erred in finding Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-206(a) (2006) constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After her surgery, the patient developed what she believed to be a burn located near the surgical site. She went to an emergency room due to pain from the burn, but was admitted for conditions related to renal failure. Thereafter, the patient sued the doctors for negligence in treatment of the burn and in the operating room. The parties agreed that expert testimony was necessary. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that the challenged language, &quot;By means of expert testimony provided only by a medical care provider of the same specialty as the defendant&quot; in &sect; 16-114-206(a) added requirements to Ark. R. Evid. 702, attempted to dictate procedure, and invaded the province of the judiciary's authority to set and control procedure. As such, it violated the separation-of-powers doctrine in Ark. Const. amend. 80, &sect; 3, and the inherent authority of the courts to protect the integrity of proceedings and the rights of the litigants. As the question of whether the patient could amend her pleadings--to correct the assertion of negligence against one of the doctors--had not been addressed, remand was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff rice farmers brought an action against defendant, a manufacturer of genetically engineered rice, in the Circuit Court of Lonoke County (Arkansas), alleging negligence. A jury awarded the farmers $ 5.9 million in compensatory damages and $ 42 million in punitive damages, and the circuit court entered judgment on the verdict. The manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The farmers alleged that the manufacturer knew that the majority of American-grown rice was exported, that other countries did not import genetically modified rice, and that contamination of the United States rice supply with genetically altered rice would depress the export market, yet the manufacturer tested its genetically engineered rice without taking adequate precautions to prevent contamination of conventional rice seed, resulting in depressed exports and prices. The manufacturer argued that the cap on punitive damages of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-55-208 should apply. The court held that &sect; 16-55-208 was unconstitutional under Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 32, because it limited the amount of recovery outside of an employment relationship. The economic loss doctrine did not bar the farmers' recovery because there was physical damage to the farmers' crops, field, and equipment. The farmers' expert's testimony on damages was admissible under Ark. R. Evid. 702; the manufacturer's objections to his methods of calculation went to weight, not admissibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board increased the amount of monthly pension benefits by a fixed dollar amount per month for current retired members were receiving meager monthly benefits. The officers argued that the fixed dollar increases were not permitted by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 24-11-102 (Repl. 2002). The court disagreed, finding that the statute clearly allowed the board to increase benefits and did not require that the increase take any particular form. The statute also allowed benefits to be increased for some retirees and not others. The statute did not grant unfettered discretion to the board and was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Because the board increased benefits in 1996, the Arkansas Trust Code did not apply. The increased benefits for those members who had retired at an earlier time was based on the perceived need to assist those retirees who were not eligible to receive cost of living increases. As such, there was a rational basis for the board's disparate treatment of current and future retirees, and no violation of the equal protection clause, Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 26-35-901 and asserting an illegal exaction claim. Some appellees moved to dismiss; the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) granted the motion and dismissed the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant asserted that the Division violated Ark.

Const. art. XVI, &sect; 13. The trial court dismissed the case on grounds it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. The high court held that appellant's reliance on &sect; 26-35-901 was misplaced, because as a cable-services provider, its remedy for a challenged assessment was provided for in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-26-1610. Its claim that the PSC wrongly included its intangible personal property in its ad valorem assessments should have been brought before the PSC, which had exclusive authority over such assessments and challenges thereto under Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 26-24-103 and 26-26-1610. And as appellant did not challenge the validity of the underlying tax, but alleged that the assessment was carried out in an illegal fashion due to its property falling within a statutory exemption, its suit did not come within the illegal-exaction provision of Ark.

Although there was no proof offered as to the specific details of care the victim's parents expected defendant to provide, there was testimony that the victim's father trusted defendant to care for the victim. The trial court properly upheld the constitutionality of the rape shield statute. The court declined to address defendant's argument that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence a statement defendant gave to police while in custody because defendant made only a conclusory allegation that his waiver of his Miranda rights was involuntary due to the influence of drugs and alcohol. Regarding defendant's argument that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of defendant's friend on the subject of defendant's character for truthfulness, defendant's failure to proffer the friend's testimony precluded appellate review of this point.</SPAN></P>

He challenged an order of the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which ruled that the commission did not have to force voters to use voting booths.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The voter alleged that the commission breached the public's trust by &quot;community table voting.&quot; The supreme court held that in accordance with &sect; 7-5-309(a)(2), the commission had to situate the voting booths so as to permit a voter to prepare his or her ballot screened from observation, but &sect; 7-5-309(a)(2) did not require the commission to force a voter to prepare his or her ballot in a voting booth. Pursuant to &sect; 7-5-30(a)(2), the commission had to provide the opportunity for a voter to prepare his or her ballot in a voting booth. Section 7-5-309(a)(4) defined the immediate voting area and stated who could lawfully enter that area. However, it did not state that a voter could not mark a ballot outside of the immediate voting area. A voter could waive his or her right to vote in secrecy. No one could force a voter to cast an open ballot, and a voter could not be restrained from exercising his or her privilege of voting in secrecy, but if a voter desired to vote outside the confines of a voting booth, he or she could do so. A voter was not required to avail himself or herself of the methods in place to ensure privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An award of permanent custody of the children to their maternal grandmother was improper because the first statutory preference, Ark.

The first preference of the statute was not to return the child to the parent &quot;from whom he had been taken&quot; because that phrase was not included in the statute. The interpretation asserted by the children would have lead to an absurd result because a non-offending, noncustodial parent would be excluded from consideration under the first preference and instead considered under the fifth preference, which was afforded to a &quot;fit and willing relative.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of capital-felony murder and aggravated robbery. He was 17 years old at the time the offenses were committed. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the capital-murder conviction. On appeal, the court found that defendant's concession that he participated in the aggravated robbery presented adequate grounds to uphold his conviction for capital-felony murder. Because it was patently clear that the victim was killed in furtherance of an aggravated robbery that was planned and executed by defendant, the evidence was more than sufficient to convict him of capital-felony murder. The trial court properly denied his motion for a directed verdict. Further, the imposition of a life-without-parole sentence for a juvenile capital-felony-murder offender did not violate Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 9. Finally, the imposition of the mandatory life-without parole sentence was not illegal because it did not violate defendant's right to a jury trial under Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 10 and Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-103(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers argued that the city failed to comply with Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-235-223(a)(1) (Repl. 1998), and thus, that the fee was an illegal exaction. The taxpayers argued that the fee was an illegal exaction given that approximately 40 percent of the 25,000 sewage customers of the city were not required to pay it. The appellate court found that &sect; 14-235-223(a)(1) did not state that the fee had to be paid by any beneficiary, whether intended or unintended, of the sewerage system, and the code did not define &quot;sewerage system&quot; to distinguish between the wastewater sewer system and the stormwater sewer system. The trial court properly found that imposing the fee only on those customers over which the city had jurisdiction to operate the stormwater utility, even if some customers outside the city limits may have derived some benefit from the service, did not constitute an illegal exaction. In the exercise of its police powers, the city established the stormwater utility, and the fee charged was not a tax under &sect; 14-235-223(a)(1). The trial court's finding that the fee was not intended as a means of paying for already existing services was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Const. amend. 89.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ark. Const. amend. 89 concerned public and private debt obligations, as well as issuance of energy efficiency bonds. The ballot title was complete enough to convey an intelligible idea of the scope and import of the proposed amendment. Therefore, the alleged omissions did not constitute a manifest fraud upon the public. Nothing was offered in the case to show that there was an open and obvious fraud committed by the ballot title. Furthermore, the ballot title complied with Ark. Const. art. 19, &sect; 22 in that it identified and distinguished the amendment and was not worded in some way as to constitute a manifest fraud upon the public. In this case, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 7-9-204 (2007), was at variance with Ark. Const. art. 19, &sect; 22, and violated the Arkansas Constitution. Finally, each relevant section of Ark. Const. amend. 89 spoke to a form of economic development and debt obligations. Therefore, each relevant section related to the general subject of the amendment. Further, each relevant section was reasonably germane to the others. Therefore, there was no violation of the separate-issue requirement under Ark. Const. art. 19, &sect; 22.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Jefferson County Circuit Court (Arkansas) denied appellant juvenile's motions to transfer a case to juvenile court, to dismiss the case, and to declare the transfer statute,&nbsp;Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile was charged with capital murder, first-degree escape, three counts of aggravated robbery, two counts of theft of property, and second-degree battery. In the late afternoon before the transfer hearing, the defense received a fax with two names listed as additional, last-minute witnesses. The State blatantly violated Ark. R. Crim. P. 17.1(a) by refusing to offer these witnesses' names until the afternoon before the hearing. It also violated the circuit court's directive to complete discovery by a given deadline. As a result, the defense did not have time to interview the two key witnesses. Although the hearing was not a trial or an adjudication, the State's dilatory behavior nevertheless occurred at a pivotal point in the proceedings when the circuit court was deciding the critical issue of whether the juvenile would be tried as a juvenile or as an adult. Thus, under the circumstances, the State's violation of Rule 17.1 and the court's order not only offended notions of fair play but also was highly prejudicial and was not harmless error. Accordingly, the circuit court abused its discretion by not excluding the two witnesses' testimony.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The statutory provision was in direct conflict with Rule 3 that provided the specific type of interlocutory appeals that could be brought by the State, and an interlocutory appeal from a transfer order was not one of them. Where there was a conflict between procedural rules and a statute, statutes were given deference only to the extent to which they were compatible with the rules; conflicts which compromised the rules were resolved with the rules remaining supreme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs customers brought a class action against defendant automobile group. The Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) granted summary judgment on the class's claim based on the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (ADTPA), denied its motion to amend, and dismissed its claim for unjust enrichment. Customers appealed and appellee automobile group cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The class argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in granting the automotive group summary judgment on the class's ADTPA claim involving a documentary fee that constituted the unauthorized practice of law. The class argued that the circuit court's reliance on the supreme court's decision in Preston v. Stoops was misplaced, claiming that decision merely held that the ADTPA could not regulate an attorney's conduct and did not hold that the legislature could not prohibit nonlawyer corporations from providing legal services. The supreme court agreed. The power of the judicial department, acting through the supreme court to regulate the practice of law, was &quot;exclusive and supreme&quot; under Ark. Const. amend. 28. Yet, nonlawyers were beyond its purview for purposes of meaningful sanction. The supreme court held that, where the General Assembly saw fit to provide a cause of action when warranted for such activity by a nonlawyer, such as under the ADTPA, neither Preston v. Stoops nor Amendment 28 precluded such action, as long as the legislation did not hinder, interfere with, restrict, or frustrate the powers of the judiciary to define, regulate, and control the practice of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part on direct appeal. The judgment was affirmed on cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, state agencies and intervenor political action committee, sought review of a judgment from the Pulaski County Circuit Court, Second Division, Arkansas, which declared Initiated Act 1, codified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-8-301 to 9-8-305 (2009) (Act 1), unconstitutional as it violated fundamental privacy rights implicit in the Arkansas Constitution. Appellees, unmarried adults and parents and their biological children, cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Act 1 was a ballot initiative, approved by the Arkansas voters, which prevented unmarried adults that were cohabitating with a sexual partner from adopting or becoming a foster parent of a child. The court found that the fundamental right to privacy implicit in Arkansas law that protected all private, consensual, noncommercial acts of sexual intimacy between adults was at issue. The burden imposed by the State under Act 1 was direct and substantial. Thus, the court applied the heightened scrutiny standard. Because Act 1 exacted a categorical ban against all cohabiting couples engaged in sexual conduct, the court held that it was not narrowly tailored or the least restrictive means available to serve the State's compelling interest of protecting the best interest of the child. The court concluded that the individualized assessments of people wanting to adopt or become foster parents conducted by the Arkansas Department of Human Services and the trial courts was the least restrictive means necessary for addressing the State's compelling interest of protecting the welfare, safety, and best interest of Arkansas's children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed. The cross-appeal was moot.</SPAN></P>

In this case, it was undisputed that the insurer was not a party and would not become a party to the underlying lawsuit. Therefore, the insurer was prohibited by Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court described evidence that the former owner attempted to undermine the efforts of the new owners in bringing in new business, sabotaged the business in violation of his noncompetition agreement, and failed to perform his duties with diligence and competence. The court thus affirmed the jury's breach of contract verdict. Also, the jury heard dueling experts but chose to believe the testimony of the expert for the new owners on the subject of lost-profit damages and the court thus could not say that the jury's award of damages was in error. Regarding the new owners' claim of defamation, the former owner identified one of the new owners in his statements, implied that the new owner had substance abuse problems, and communicated those statements to third parties. The jury gave weight to testimony indicating that former owner's statements were not substantially true and it was up to the jury to judge the weight and credibility of the evidence. The court also held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in reading to the jury an Arkansas model jury instruction defining defamation.</SPAN></P>

The father sought review of orders from the Faulkner County Circuit Court, Arkansas, which denied his motion for a declaratory judgment and denied his motion for reconsideration of his discovery requests. He argued the circuit court erred in finding res judicata foreclosed his challenge to the paternity of a minor child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the divorce proceedings, the father sought paternity testing for the child. A divorce decree was entered, ordering him to pay child support for the child. His motion for paternity testing was denied. In the current action, he challenged having to pay support for the child on the basis of the child's paternity. The court concluded that the doctrine of res judicata barred the father from relitigating the issue of paternity. As the father did not appeal from the denial of his motion for paternity testing or from the divorce decree, he could not challenge paternity. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to modify the divorce decree under Ark. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(4) on the basis of fraud as the father admitted during the divorce hearing that he questioned the mother about the paternity of the child before they were married and she admitted there was a possibility the child was not the father's child. As his discovery requests sought evidence to collaterally attack the issue of paternity, they were properly denied. As the constitutionality of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-10-115 was an issue that could have been raised in the first litigation, it was barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action involved a dispute over child visitation. The mother argued on appeal that the partner had no recognizable right entitling her to visitation with the child, but the supreme court affirmed the circuit court's order that, in part, granted the partner visitation under a theory of in loco parentis or equitable estoppel. Considering the ample evidence about the relationship between the partner and the child, the circuit court did not clearly err in finding that she stood in loco parentis to the child. It was undisputed that she was the stay-at-home mom for over three years who took care of the child and the child called her mommy. The child thought of the partner's parents as her grandparents and spent holidays with the partner's family. The parties' intentions were always to co-parent, until the mother unilaterally determined that she no longer wanted the partner to have visitation.

Code Ann. &sect; 9-9-207(a)(2) (2009) because he failed, without justifiable cause, to establish communication or financial support to the child. He made no good-faith effort to locate the mother or the child from August 2006, when the mother moved to Arkansas, until late 2007. He could have located the mother at any time. A $ 750 check, dated May 2006, was the only form of financial assistance given to the mother for the child throughout the child's life. Section 9-9-207(a)(11) was not applied to the father in a discriminatory manner because he never registered with the Arkansas Putative Father Registry.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant tobacco products manufacturer sought certain advisory opinions from appellee Arkansas Tobacco Control Board (the Board). In response, the Board issued four separate opinions. The manufacturer sought judicial review and declaratory relief. The Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) affirmed the Board's opinions and denied declaratory relief. The manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">First, the Board was clearly wrong in interpreting Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-75-702, -708, provisions of the Unfair Cigarette Sales Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-701 et seq. (2001 &amp; Supp. 2009). A cooperative organization, by virtue of being considered a retailer, pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-702(8), was prohibited from providing rebates. The Board's consideration of cooperatives as buying pools exempt from the anti-rebating provision was clearly wrong. Second, the Board's opinion that the manufacturer could not meet cooperative-competitor's pricing by factoring in patronage dividends was neither arbitrary nor capricious. Because the patronage dividend paid to retailers by cooperatives constituted illegal rebates under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-708(b), any attempt by a wholesaler to match that price could not be made in good faith. Third, because the Board's Opinion 2007-004 was an advisory opinion, by which it took no action, it could not have been ultra vires. Finally, the circuit court did not err in denying declaratory relief. The manufacturer lacked standing because no justiciable controversy existed. It sought declaratory relief on events only hypothetical in nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the opinions of the Board, and affirmed the circuit court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant family trusts sought review of an order from the White County Circuit Court, Arkansas, which directed appellee pipeline company to take possession of a certain part of the trusts' land pursuant to the power of eminent domain to contract and maintain a pipeline for the gathering of natural gas. The trusts challenged the constitutionality of the delegation of the power of eminent domain under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-15-101 (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trusts argued that &sect; 23-15-101 was unconstitutionally vague and did not delegate the State's eminent domain power to pipeline companies. The court found that &sect; 23-15-101 did not require nor forbid the trusts to act in any way. Because the statute did not apply to the trusts' conduct, they had no standing to challenge &sect; 23-15-101 on the basis that it was void for vagueness under due process standards. The trusts claimed that the gathering pipeline was not a public use of their property. The court found that by electing to operate its gathering line as a common carrier, the pipeline company gave the public the equal right to use the pipeline to transport natural gas to the market. The stipulated facts indicated that the gathering line on the trusts' property would be used by several royalty owners and working-interest owners. Thus, the pipeline company was not in violation of Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 22. Because the court found that &sect; 23-15-101 was constitutionally applied to the trusts, the trusts had no standing to advance a facial challenge to the vagueness of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner lessor sought a writ of prohibition against respondent circuit court, arguing that the circuit court lacked personal jurisdiction over it due to a defective summons. Thus, it should have granted the lessor's motion to dismiss. The lessor sought to prohibit the circuit court from proceeding with respondent employees of lessees' negligence claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The summons issued to the lessor in the employees' action incorrectly stated that the lessor had 30 days, rather than 20 days, to answer the complaint. The lessor filed an answer objecting to personal jurisdiction for failure to comply with Ark. R. Civ. P. 4(b). The lessor later filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment, which was denied by the circuit court. The court found that the service requirements of Rule 4 had to be strictly construed. Thus, the summons was deficient under Rule 4(b), and the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the lessor. However, the court found that prohibition was not appropriate as the circuit court had already acted on the matter. As the circuit court was without jurisdiction to hear the matter, the court found that the issuance of a writ of certiorari was appropriate. The lessor argued that the complaint should be dismissed with prejudice as it was barred by the statute of limitations and because the savings statute at Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-56-126 was unconstitutional. The court concluded that those issues were premature.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P. 68 to appellee driver who made offers of judgment to the parents and the son that were greater than the amounts of the jury verdicts in their favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The award of costs to the driver was greater than the sum of the jury verdicts against the driver. The court rejected the parents' argument that Ark. R. Civ. P. 68 chilled their right to a jury trial given that the parents did in fact receive a jury trial. On a question of first impression, the court also rejected the parents' contention that Rule 68, as written, violated the equal protection clauses of the United States and Arkansas Constitutions because it allowed a defendant to make an enforceable offer of judgment but did not extend the same privilege to a plaintiff. Under the rational basis test, the policy of Rule 68 in encouraging settlements was neutral, favoring neither plaintiffs nor defendants. Also, plaintiffs and defendants were not similarly situated since plaintiffs were parties by choice but defendants were not. Plaintiffs could offer to settle or even dismiss their cases but defendants had no ability to enforce a settlement. Given the purpose of Rule 68 to foster settlement, it was rational for the rule to distinguish between plaintiffs and defendants.</SPAN></P>

After learning that he was on parole, the officers interrogated him and later searched his house. The trial court denied his motion to suppress. On appeal, the court found that the officers did not violate Ark. R. Crim. P. 2.2(a) by calling defendant to their vehicle and asking him his name. The totality of the circumstances provided the officers with reasonable suspicion under Ark. R. Crim. P. 3.1 to pursue and stop him when he ran. However, no investigation was taken prior to his arrest. The arresting officer first learned that he was on parole after the arrest when he read a printout at the police department. The stop and brief detention afforded by Wardlow was not undertaken by the officers. They simply arrested defendant for fleeing. While they had reasonable suspicion to make the stop, they transformed the stop into an illegal seizure by arresting him instead of carrying out the brief investigation permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Executive Director of the Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct filed a petition and an amended petition for disbarment against an attorney, alleging violations of the Ark. R. Prof. Conduct 3.1, 3.3(a), 3.4(c), 4.4(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). A special judge (Arkansas) entered an order recommending disbarment with respect to 32 counts charged in the petition and the amended petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The special judge concluded that twenty of the counts rose to the level of serious misconduct, as defined in Ark. Sup. Ct. Prof. Conduct P. 17(B). The court adopted the special judge's findings of fact and determined that the attorney violated the Rules as set forth in the petition and amended petition. For years the attorney refused to accept the finality of decisions rendered by courts of competent jurisdiction. Instead, he had consistently engaged in conduct intended to harass opposing counsel and judges with whom he disagreed. In so doing, he had wasted vast amounts of time and judicial resources. He had also been unwilling to obey direct orders of the court and had withheld material information from state and federal courts. Given the number of violations, the length of time over which the attorney had incurred such violations, and the attorney's repeated unwillingness to accept the finality of court decisions, his actions constituted serious misconduct and disbarment was the appropriate sanction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, an attorney and a circuit clerk, filed an application for a writ of mandamus, prohibition, or certiorari, seeking to quash in their entirety two orders of respondent, the Circuit Judge of Carroll County (Arkansas), which dissolved the Eastern and Western Judicial Districts of Carroll County. The circuit judge found that 1883 Ark. Acts 74 was unconstitutional and was repealed by implication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">1883 Ark. Acts 74 created the Eastern and Western Judicial Districts of Carroll County. Carroll County operated with split judicial districts and two separate courthouses. The supreme court held that the circuit judge erred in his construction of 1883 Ark. Acts 74 that two counties were created. The clear terms of 1883 Ark. Acts 74 created two separate judicial districts for circuit court within Carroll County and did not divide the county or attempt to create two separate counties. The Act specifically referred to the judicial districts in Carroll County. Neither Ark. Const. amend. 55 nor Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 14-14-101 to 14-14-1314 could reasonably be interpreted to repeal 1883 Ark. Acts 74 by implication. The basic requirements of a repeal by implication did not exist. Circuit court judges were not granted the power to establish or dissolve judicial districts in Arkansas under Ark. Const. amend. 80, although they had the authority to interpret state law. The sum total of what the circuit judge did was to act in contravention of Ark. Const. amend.  80 when he issued his standing order dissolving the Eastern and Western Judicial Districts in Carroll County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Saline County Circuit Court (Arkansas) convicting him, upon a jury's verdict, of capital murder, in violation of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-101(a)(4) (2006), and kidnapping, in violation of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-11-102 (2006), and sentencing him to death and life imprisonment, respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">First, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for directed verdict on the kidnapping charge because there was sufficient evidence to corroborate the codefendant's testimony that defendant restrained the victim to the point of interfering with his liberty. Second, the denial of a directed verdict on the capital murder charge was proper because there was sufficient evidence of premeditation and deliberation. While the majority of evidence to prove premeditation and deliberation was provided via accomplice testimony, that testimony was corroborated by forensic evidence and testimony from other witnesses. Third, the trial court did not err in refusing to declare defendant's girlfriend as an accomplice and in refusing to instruct the jury that her testimony required corroboration because there was no evidence to support a finding of accomplice liability. Fourth, Arkansas' death-penalty statues were not unconstitutional for lack of comparative proportionality, void for vagueness, or overly broad, and did not impose a mandatory death sentence. Finally, there was no prosecutorial misconduct that rose to the level to require the trial court to sua sponte grant a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, who included the administrator of a murdered woman's estate, the sister of the woman and the daughter of the sister, sought review of summary judgment by the Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas) for appellees police officer and police chief in a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action claiming that the officer should have followed the woman all the way back to a battered women's shelter after a confrontation with her husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court noted that there was no police department policy authorizing officers to provide private individual protection. It thus did not appear that a custom or policy was involved in the officer's decision to follow the woman only partly way back to the shelter before checking on children of the husband. Nothing in the language of the Due Process Clause required a law enforcement officer to protect citizens against invasion by private actors such as the husband. Assuming the officer heard the husband make a threat, he would have been under a duty to arrest him, but the benefit that a third party may receive from having someone else arrested for a crime generally did not trigger procedural or substantive Due Process Clause protections and could not be the basis for &sect; 1983 liability. The state-created danger exception to the absence of an affirmative right to safety under the Due Process Clause did not apply because the officer did not exhibit deliberate indifference to the woman's plight or otherwise put her at significant risk of harm. Also, there were no material facts to indicate he acted recklessly in conscious disregard of the risk so as to shock the court's conscience.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed summary judgment for the officer and the police chief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant claimed that circuit court (1) abused its discretion when it enjoined appellant from transferring assets; (2) abused its discretion when it enjoined appellant and its insurers from paying attorneys' fees for the defense of the case; and (3) lacked authority to order appellant to produce a history of attorneys' fees paid. The court found that the appeal from the first order enjoining appellant from transferring assets was moot as the circuit court later set aside the order. The second order restraining appellant from paying attorneys' fees was error as the administrator made neither a showing of irreparable harm, nor a showing of likelihood of success on the merits as required by Ark. R. Civ. P. 65 (2010). The most the administrator alleged was that appellant's insurance coverage consisted of a wasting policy, which, if depleted by the costs of the defense, could diminish any future recovery by the administrator. The court found that the third order was a discovery order and not appealable except upon final judgment. The appeal from the order seeking a history of attorneys' fees paid was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sole point on appeal was that the circuit court erred by reversing the Board's decision based upon its finding that the statute establishing the Board violated the constitution.

The challenge to the constitutionality of the Arkansas Professional Bail Bond Company and Professional Bail Bondsman Licensing Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-19-106 (2001), was based upon the requirement that one member of the Board be a municipal or circuit judge, allegedly violating the doctrine of separation of powers. The appellate court found that the constitutional challenge was not appropriately brought by a direct action but rather was presented as an argument in an appeal to a decision by the Board, an appeal specifically governed by the Arkansas Administrative Procedure. The circuit court specifically found that the actions of the Board were consistent with, and in compliance with, its rules and regulations, were not based upon unlawful procedure, were supported by substantial evidence, and were not arbitrary or capricious; thus, it should have upheld the Board's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas), pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-15-212, affirmed an order of appellee, the Arkansas State Board of Education (the Board), which granted appellee school district's petition to close a K-12 school campus, pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 6-20-602(a) (2007). Appellant parents, individually and on behalf of their minor children, sought further review. The Board cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Addressing the cross-appeal first, the circuit court did not err in denying the Board's motion to dismiss the parents' appeal because the approval of the petition for closure was sufficient injury to confer standing on the parents, and the parents were entitled to review under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-15-212. Next, on direct appeal, the parents alleged that the children would have been subjected to excessive transportation time of up to four hours on a bus, which denied the children a substantial equal opportunity to an adequate education. Instead of challenging the evidence before the Board, the parents urged that the State had the obligation to render a definition of excessive transportation time. However, the State was not a party in the case and the State's duty to provide an adequate education was not before the court. Accordingly, the Board's approval of the petition for closure was not in violation of the children's constitutional rights under Ark. Const. arts. II, &sect;&sect; 2, 3, 8; XIV, &sect; 1. Finally, the parents substantial rights were not prejudiced by the Board's closure decision and the decision itself was not in violation of any constitutional authority.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 18-15-1303, appellant property owners challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of White County (Arkansas), which found that appellee pipeline company had the authority to exercise the power of eminent domain over the property owners' land in order to construct and maintain a natural gas pipeline.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pipeline company failed in negotiations for a right-of-way agreement with the property owners, which it sought to construct a pipeline for natural gas transmission across certain lands. The pipeline company filed an eminent domain action, and the circuit court entered judgment in favor of the pipeline company. The property owners appealed, but the appellate court affirmed. The proposed pipeline was available to multiple natural gas producers who had working interests in the surrounding area, and the pipeline company planned to operate its natural gas pipeline as a common carrier, meaning that the public had the equal right to use the pipeline to transport natural gas. Thus, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-15-101 had not granted the power of eminent domain to the pipeline company for a private use in violation of Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 22. Because &sect; 23-15-101 neither required nor forbade the property owners to act in any way, they lacked standing to assert that &sect; 23-15-101 was vague as to their conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner bill sponsor instituted an original action pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 7-9-505 (2007) for the court's review of a Secretary of State determination of the legal sufficiency of a statewide initiative petition for an Arkansas Constitutional Amendment to repeal all state taxes and to replace them with a flat rate sales tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Arkansas Progressive Group submitted a proposed popular name and ballot title to change Arkansas tax laws to the Attorney General for review and certification pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 7-9-107 (2007). The Attorney General changed the popular name, certified the substituted popular name, and stated that the bill would not violate the Arkansas Constitution. The Secretary of State affirmed the certification. The bill's sponsor brought the instant original action to review that certification. The court granted the citizens' group's motion to intervene.  The citizens' group then objected to the sponsor's eligibility to seek either the Secretary of State's certification or the court's review and further challenged the certification of the popular name and ballot title on the basis that they were unfair and incomplete. The court held that, although the statute did not clearly prevent a sponsor from bringing the actions for certification and review, the statutory language supported such a conclusion because the sponsor was unlikely to challenge the petition's validity. Without the existence of adverse parties, statutory review would be meaningless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the petition for review and the cross-petition for review and vacated the Secretary of State's declaration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insureds contracted with the insurer for an actual cash value homeowner's insurance policy on their real and personal property that provided coverage for the replacement and/or repair of the insureds' property. The policy defined &quot;actual cash value&quot; as the replacement cost of the property at the time of loss, less depreciation, not exceeding the amount it would cost to repair or replace with material of like kind and quality. The insurer adjusted the repair estimates and depreciated both materials and labor on a repair for tornado damage. The insureds filed suit for failure to timely and properly pay insurance claims. The original action included claims for personal property that were not included in the amended complaints or the complaint for which certification was sought. The court held that the insurer's objection to the class action was improperly based on the personal property claim that was not part of the action. The insurer admitted that it had adjusted the claims of all class members in the same way that it had adjusted the insureds' claim, i.e. by depreciating the cost of labor. The court held that the action met all of the requirements for class certification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant former judge sought review of a judgment from the Pulaski County Circuit Court, Seventeenth Division, Arkansas, which granted the motion to dismiss of appellees, a county election commission, the Secretary of State, and the Arkansas Judicial Discipline &amp; Disability Commission (JDDC), his action to declare Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-10-410(d) (2009) unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The JDDC made findings that the judge had willfully violated the code of judicial conduct and the court removed him from office. He filed with the Secretary of State as a write-in candidate for the same office from which he had been removed. He filed his action for a declaratory judgment and sought a writ of mandamus directing the election commission to count his write-in votes. The trial court issued a writ of mandamus instructing the election commission not to count his votes. The judge argued that &sect; 16-10-410(d) was unconstitutional as it added a qualification to the office of circuit judge. The court agreed and held &sect; 16-10-410(d)&nbsp;unconstitutional because it encroached on the power of the judiciary to interpret the law. However, Ark. Const. amend. 66 gave the JDDC the authority to investigate complaints of judicial misconduct, hold hearings, and make recommendations, and the court could then take action, including removing a judge from office. The judge had been removed from the bench as a sanction for his misconduct. Because he was removed, rather then suspended, he could not seek election to a judicial office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the finding that &sect; 16-10-410(d) was constitutional. The court affirmed the dismissal of the complaint and affirmed the issuance of mandamus to the election commission not to count any votes case in favor of the judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action involving the judicial dissolution of a law firm, the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) denied appellant partner one's motion to vacate a judgment, approved appellant creditor's claim against the firm and denied his requests to unwind previous court orders and to require shareholders to return disburse funds. Partner one appealed. Appellees, the creditor's estate administrator, partner two, and partner three cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">First, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying partner one's motion to vacate a judgment on partner two's counterclaim. The judgment determined that partner two was entitled to a sum for office expenses incurred pursuant to an oral agreement between the two partners. On appeal, partner one argued that the order should have been vacated pursuant to Ark. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(4) on the basis of fraud and misrepresentation. But, the asserted link between partner two's allegedly perjured testimony and the trial court's entry of the judgment was too tenuous. Second, the creditor's estate was substituted as the appealing party because he was killed in an automobile collision on his way to a hearing. Because the trial court denied the creditor's right to due process on remand by failing to provide him with a meaningful hearing and by incorrectly determining that he was barred from seeking relief, the administrator was entitled to remand. Third, there was no merit to partner two's cross-appeal that the creditor failed to prove his claim. Partner two failed to cite any authority in support of his argument. Finally, partner three's cross-appeal was dismissed as untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed as to partner one's appeal, reversed and remanded as to the administrator's cross-appeal, affirmed as to partner two's cross-appeal, and dismissed partner three's cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant patient sought review of an order of the Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas) dismissing her medical malpractice claim against appellee medical providers for lack of proper venue pursuant to Ark. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3). On appeal, the patient claimed that the trial court erroneously interpreted and applied Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-55-213(e) (2005), or, in the alternative, that &sect; 16-55-213(e) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient contracted a staph infection following back surgery. She received treatment from medical providers in two different counties. The trial court held that pursuant to &sect; 16-55-213(e) each provider had to be sued in the county wherein the services were provided. While it might have been burdensome and failed to promote judicial economy to have two different trials in two different counties where there was an alleged course of conduct, &sect; 16-55-213(e) clearly required such action. There was no merit to the patient's argument that the plain reading of &sect; 16-55-213 demonstrated that &sect; 16-55-213(e) was inapplicable to the facts of her case. Similarly, there was no merit to her argument that the venue provision of &sect;16-55-213(e) was procedural and conflicted with Ark. R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owners sought review of an order of the Cleburne County Circuit Court (Arkansas) finding that appellee gas company had the authority pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-15-101 (2002) to exercise the power of eminent domain to construct and maintain a natural gas pipeline over the property owners' land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The gas company was a private, for-profit corporation and not a public utility company. However, the Arkansas Public Service Commission had determined that the gas company could use the eminent domain authority delegated by &sect; 23-15-101 as a common carrier without obtaining a certificate of convenience or necessity or other approval from the Commission prior to doing so. On appeal, the property owners assert that the trial court's order was in error because &sect; 23-15-101 was unconstitutional in that it granted private corporations the right of eminent domain to acquire property for private, rather than public, use in violation of Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 22. However, by exercising the right of eminent domain under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-15-101, the gas company elected to operate its pipeline as a common carrier, giving the public the equal right to use the pipeline to transport natural gas. Accordingly, &sect; 23-15-101 had not granted the power of eminent domain to the gas company for purely private use, and &sect; 23-15-101 was constitutional as applied to the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

They challenged a judgment of the Benton County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which granted the pilots motion to dismiss, finding that the tort immunity provided by the Workers' Compensation Act's exclusive-remedy provision, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-105 (2002), barred any claim against the pilot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The co-employees and the pilot were dispatched together by their employer to pick up a patient. The co-employees contended that the pilot did not safely operate the helicopter. The pilot argued that he was immune from suit pursuant to &sect; 11-9-105. The supreme court held that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the co-employees' injuries were covered under the Act. The co-employees were arguing that the pilot was a third person who did not enjoy immunity under the Act. However, the Workers' Compensation Commission had exclusive original jurisdiction to determine that issue. When a party to a lawsuit raised a question of whether a person enjoyed immunity as an employer under the Act, the Commission had to first decide the issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband sought review of an order of the Faulkner County Circuit Court (Arkansas) denying his motion for declaratory judgment and his motion for reconsideration of his discovery requests for the medical records of appellee wife, by which he sought to prove that he was not the father of a child born during the parties' marriage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the time of the parties' divorce in 2003, the husband denied that one of the parties' two children was his child and sought a paternity test. This motion was denied. The father later obtained a paternity test stating he was not the child's father. In 2007, the wife filed a motion for contempt because the husband had started paying a lesser amount of child support. The husband moved to set aside the establishment of paternity under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-10-115(f)(1). He served the wife with discovery requests also subpoenaed medical records. The trial court quashed all discovery. The husband sought a declaratory judgment that the common law presumption of paternity was unconstitutional as well as several paternity statutes. The circuit judge denied declaratory judgment, and the husband appealed. The court observed that the husband never obtained a ruling from the circuit judge on his motion to set aside the divorce decree on grounds of fraud. Accordingly, it remained pending before the circuit court, and because there was no certification under Ark. R. Civ. P. 54(b) from the circuit judge, the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant distributor appealed from the Pulaski County Circuit Court, Arkansas, which affirmed a decision of Appellee Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy to suspend the distributor's license to sell List 1 chemicals for a period of three years and to impose a $ 175,000 civil penalty. The Board found that the distributor had violated Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-1006 (2005) and related regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board determined that the distributor had by failed to report suspicious transactions involving List 1 chemicals and had stored List 1 chemicals in an unlicensed and inappropriately equipped facility. The distributor's first point on appeal was that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-1006 and the board's regulation 08-02-0008 were impermissibly vague as applied to it and therefore unenforceable under the Arkansas constitutional guarantee of due process of law at Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 8. The court did not decide whether &sect; 5-64-1006 was subject to the stricter vagueness review connected with criminal law enforcement, because even assuming arguendo that the made such a decision, the vagueness challenge would fail. Affirming, the court concluded that the challenged statute and supporting regulation were specific and sufficient to have put the distributor on notice that it should have reported suspicious transactions with its customers to the board. Section 5-64-1006 set forth a specific and detailed definition of the term &quot;suspicious transaction.&quot; In addition, the supporting regulation provided over twenty-five additional, specific criteria for licensees to use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner asserted that his petition satisfied the requirements of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-112-103 (Repl. 2006), the statute governing habeas actions, and that the trial court erred in declining to issue the writ. The court held that the prisoner failed to demonstrate that the judgment was facially invalid or that the trial court was without jurisdiction, and therefore failed to state a ground on which the writ was warranted. The prisoner argued that the original trial court lacked jurisdiction by proceeding without first determining his competence to stand trial. Because any claim regarding the evaluation of competency was one that could have been raised in the trial court at the time of trial, and on the record on direct appeal, it was not cognizable on a writ of habeas corpus. The prisoner argued that it was error to deny him an evidentiary hearing, which, with a mental evaluation, would have established the validity of his claim that he was not competent to stand trial. The court held that this claim did not demonstrate that the trial court was without jurisdiction or that the commitment was invalid on its face.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff car accident victims filed suit against defendants, a fraternity and its members, in the Clark County Circuit Court (Arkansas). The fraternity filed a motion to dismiss under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-126-106 (Repl. 2006). The trial court granted the motion, and the victims appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victims alleged that the fraternity, by and through their officers and members, hosted a party in Hot Spring County. The party was advertised on campus and admission was charged. At least five kegs of beer were actually served at the party. Approximately 100 persons attended the party and the majority of the attendees were either current, alumni, or future members of the fraternity. One member left the party intoxicated after dark and crashed into the victims. The victims argued that the social host statute,&nbsp;&sect; 16-126-106, should not apply and that the fraternity should be treated as a retailer under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-126-104 because they charged an entry fee to the party. The court held that &sect; 16-126-104 did not apply because the fraternity was not an &quot;alcoholic beverage retailer.&quot; A retailer was any person who held a permit under any alcoholic beverage control law of the State of Arkansas to sell at retail controlled beverages to consumers only. Because the fraternity did not have a permit, it was not a retailer and could not be held liable. The court rejected the victims' challenges to the constitutionality of &sect; 16-126-106.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the dismissal of the victims' complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of three counts of capital murder in the Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas). He was sentenced to death on each count, resulting in an automatic appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Officers went to defendant's home in response to a call from his father, who worried that defendant was suicidal. Defendant answered the door and immediately agreed to go with police. One officer noticed a photo of defendant with a woman and two children and also saw a dried blood stain six to eight inches in diameter on the door. Despite having a head cold at the time, he noticed a foul odor in the apartment. Before leaving with defendant, the officers walked through the apartment; in plain view, they saw a foot extending from a pile of blankets. Officers then discovered the bodies of defendant's girlfriend and her two children. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because the officers had reason to check the apartment pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 14.3 (2009). Evidence supported the finding that defendant was not mentally retarded under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-618(a)(2) (Repl. 2006). It was error for the victims' survivors to testify that they desired the jury to impose the death sentence. Because it was not clear that the jury would have imposed the death sentence absent their request, reversal was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the death sentence and remanded the case to the trial court to resentence defendant pursuant to the requirements of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-616. The judgment of convictions for capital murder was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The city and county filed a cross appeal challenging the circuit court's denial of their motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city and county asserted that the circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction. The taxpayers claimed that the circuit court erred in applying Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-14-904(b)(3) (Supp. 2009) to the facts of the case and that the city and county failed to adhere to the clear requirements of the statute. The court found that as the taxpayers did not timely appeal from the county court order, jurisdiction in both the circuit court and the court rested on whether they properly stated a cause of action in illegal exaction. However, the court was satisfied that the taxpayers stated a claim for illegal exaction based on a lack of authority to levy an increase in tax and properly filed their complaint in circuit court. Finally, the court had to reverse the judgment of the circuit court because the circuit court judge did not have statutory or constitutional authority to retroactively apply the millage-rate increase to 2007 library taxes after the special election. Once the city issued an ordinance authorizing the ad valorem tax rates for 2007, the quorum court had authority pursuant to &sect; 14-14-904(b)(1)(A)(i) to levy taxes for the current year in its November meeting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Despite finding that the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurer challenged the order of the Sebastian County Circuit Court, Arkansas, which awarded a statutory penalty and attorney's fees, pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-79-208(d) (Supp. 2009), to appellee insured. The complaint prayed for an amount that exceeded $ 75,000. Prior to trial, the insured filed an amended demand, which sought satisfaction under the underinsured policy of damages of $ 150,000. The insurer rejected the demand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer argued that the circuit court erred by awarding a statutory penalty and attorney's fees to the insured because the $ 135,000 she recovered at trial was not within twenty percent of the amount demanded or that was sought in her suit, as required by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-79-208(d)(1). The insurer argued that, during trial, the insured had actually demanded $ 250,000, regardless of what the written complaints sought. The insured averred that the circuit court was correct in finding that her only demand was for $ 150,000 and, therefore, her recovery of $ 135,000 did fall within the twenty percent required by the statute. Affirming, the court determined that the circuit court had not erred in finding that the insured did not change the &quot;amount demanded&quot; or the amount that she sought in the suit during trial. While the insurer argued that the insured's amended demand should not be considered because it was not a pleading recognized by the Arkansas Rules of Civil Procedure, no such requirement was included in &sect; 23-79-208. The amended demand was easily evidenced because it was in the form of a document filed with the court, and it clearly stated a reduced amount being demanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment and commitment order that convicted him of two counts of capital murder and sentenced him twice to death; the supreme court affirmed. Defendant contended that the circuit court erred in failing to suppress the telephone calls that he made from the detention center because he argued that they were monitored and recorded without his consent. However, because defendant was made aware that his telephone calls were monitored and recorded, he had no reasonable expectation of privacy, and the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting transcripts of those telephone conversations into evidence. The allowance of a detective's testimony did not violate defendant's right to confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI because the detective's testimony was not hearsay since it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Therefore, defendant's confrontation argument was misplaced. The circuit court did not err by refusing to submit a jury instruction on victim-impact testimony because its substance was covered by other instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer owned real property zoned as agricultural. He applied to the city council to rezone the property as residential. The planning commission approved his preliminary plat, subject to rezoning; however, the city council denied the rezoning request. The developer filed a complaint in the circuit court for de novo review under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-56-425. The circuit judge ruled that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-56-425 did not apply, because the city council's action was legislative in nature. The Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed. The judicial branch did not have the authority to review zoning legislation de novo, as that would constitute an unconstitutional taking of legislative power. Judicial review was limited to whether the city counsel's action was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. In this case, the city council expressed legitimate concerns about traffic and safety. The city council's denial of the rezoning request was not reverse spot zoning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents filed suit against the collective appellants due to the presence of dangerous levels of carbon monoxide in the apartment units and moved for class certification. On review of the circuit court order certifying Class A claims but denying certification as to Class C claims, the court held that certification of Class A was proper because the requirements of Ark. R. Civ. P. 23--which required a showing of numerosity, commonality, predominance, typicality, superiority, and adequacy--were met because the issues surrounding the construction defects were common to all residents. However, the critical distinction between Subclass A and Subclass C was that proximate causation was a foundational element of the torts of strict liability, negligence, and wrongful death. Therefore, the residents could not establish appellants' collective liability without addressing the individualized issues of proximate causation, which involved the extent of each resident's exposure to carbon monoxide and how that exposure caused damage to each class member.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court's rulings on class certification were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The member was served with a summons and an amended complaint while on uniformed duty. He asserted that the service of process was insufficient as it violated Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-62-403 (2003) and thus, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over him. Upon review, the court noted that relief in the form of a writ of prohibition did not lie because the circuit court had already acted on the matter by denying the member's motions to dismiss. The court determined that, contrary to the circuit court's ruling, &sect; 12-62-403 was constitutional, was substantive legislation, and thus, did not violate the separation of powers doctrine in Ark. Const. art. 4. Furthermore, because the parties did not dispute that service of process was improper under &sect; 12-62-403, the circuit court's continued exercise of jurisdiction over the member was a plain, manifest, clear, and gross abuse of discretion. Finally, the member was without an adequate alternative remedy, as the circuit court's refusal to grant the member's motion to dismiss was not a final appealable order. Thus, a writ of certiorari was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of capital murder while committing burglary. He sought leave from the court to proceed with a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Rule 37.1. The court found that defendant's petition provided no relief based upon the trial judge's alleged bias. The actions taken by the trial judge that defendant alleged were based upon bias presented issues of trial error, including evidentiary matters, and were conclusory and unsupported by the law or the facts. Further, trial counsel was not ineffective for not requesting that the jury be instructed on lesser-included offenses. Defendant argued at trial that he had absolutely no involvement in the victim's murder and was not present when it occurred. It would have therefore made no sense to instruct the jury on any lesser-included offense as a lesser-included offense was inconsistent with defendant's trial defense. Not requesting a lesser-included-offense instruction was likely a tactical decision. Overall, the allegations raised in the Rule 37.1 petition did not present questions of such fundamental or basic nature that the underlying criminal conviction was a complete nullity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient filed a complaint, alleging that the doctor and the medical center's nursing staff were negligent in connection with a fall she sustained. The medical center answered and pled that it was a non-profit entity insured by an insurance carrier; the carrier was named an as additional party defendant under the direct-action statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-79-210. At trial, the circuit judge did not err by prohibiting the patient from presenting to the jury the fact that the medical center's insurance carrier was a named defendant; this was not relevant evidence. The Supreme Court of Arkansas held that the circuit judge did not err by denying the patient's proffered instruction that would have allowed the jury to consider the testimony of her physician expert on the standard of care for the nursing staff; he was never qualified as an expert on nursing. The patient waived any objection to the admission of the video-deposition testimony of a nurse under Ark. R. Civ.

Code Ann. &sect; 16-55-202, that required a fact finder to consider or assess the negligence or fault of nonparties, violated the Arkansas Constitution, when considered along with the modification of &quot;joint and several&quot; liability, and whether Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, worker, wife, and bankruptcy trustee, argued that the nonparty-fault provision of the Civil Justice Reform Act of 2003 (CJRA), Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-55-201 to 16-55-220 (Supp. 2003), codified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-55-202, was unconstitutional because it violated the Arkansas Constitution. The supreme court found that the provision was unconstitutional and conflicted with Ark. Const. art. 4, &sect; 2 and Ark. Const. amend. 80, &sect; 3. Rules regarding pleading, practice, and procedure were solely the responsibility of the supreme court. The nonparty-fault provision bypassed the rules of pleading, practice and procedure by setting up a procedure to determine the fault of a nonparty and mandating the consideration of that nonparty's fault in an effort to reduce a plaintiff's recovery. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-55-202 violated separation of powers as well as Ark. Const. amend. 80, &sect; 3. The medical-costs provision, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-55-212(b) (Supp. 2003), also violated separation of powers under Ark. Const. art. 4, &sect; 2 and Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Committee notified appellant of his assessment as a level four sex offender. He was interviewed during the assessment process and given the opportunity to provide his version of the offenses of which he was accused. Accordingly, the Supreme Court of Arkansas held that he was not unconstitutionally denied a hearing. Because appellant was convicted of two separate sexual assaults on two separate women, admitted that he had been involved in forced sex acts, and thought about raping, there was substantial evidence to support the Committee's assessment of appellant as a level four offender. The Committee did not improperly base appellant's classification upon his demeanor. Because the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) was not criminal in nature, the Committee's use of statements appellant's made during the assessment process, under a grant of immunity, to assess him as a level four offender did not violate his privilege against self-incrimination. Likewise, the Committee's assessment as a sex offender as a level four offender based on convictions which occurred before the effective date of SORA did not violate the ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment. The habeas corpus petition was denied on its merits. On appeal, the court held that because petitioner was on probation, and therefore not in custody, he was not entitled to any postconviction relief pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.

Code Ann. &sect; 23-79-210, which permitted direct-action lawsuits against pooled-liability funds and deemed such funds to be liability insurance for such lawsuits, was remedial in nature, and, as such, should be applied retroactively so as to effectuate the intent of the legislation. The supreme court noted that the parents raised the issues at the March 11, 2008 hearing. The supreme court determined that the statute was remedial in nature. Act 750 did not create a new cause of action. The direct-action statute, codified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-79-210, was a statutory remedy because it provided a new or substitute remedy for the underlying claim of negligence in cases where the plaintiff could not recover directly from a negligent charitable hospital. The amendment did not create a new legal right for injured parties. Act 750 did not disturb any of the pooled-liability fund's vested rights.</SPAN></P>

The inmate did not have a liberty interest in the actual disciplinary procedures administered. Nor could he show a substantive due process violation as a result of the sanctions that were imposed in the proceeding. The inmate's petition did not set forth any conditions resulting from the proceedings that showed an atypical and substantive deprivation. The inmate's petition did not state that sanctions were imposed that were sufficient to compromise a liberty interest, and unless such sanctions were imposed, the ADC's disciplinary proceedings did not invoke due process so as to mandate notice and hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction and the constitutionality of the adult-abuse statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-28-103 (1997). The supreme court noted that although the judgment and commitment order did not specify the particular subsection under which defendant was convicted, the order did state that he was convicted of a Class D felony, and that it was a case of extreme neglect. Defendant was convicted under &sect; 5-28-103(c)(1). The State proved that the victim was an impaired or endangered adult. The victim's situation put her at imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm. There was substantial evidence that defendant voluntarily assumed responsibility for the victim's custody. Defendant was responsible for the care and supervision of the victim for purposes of the definition of &quot;neglect&quot; under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-28-101(10). Defendant should have been aware of the risk to the victim, and his failure to perceive the risk posed to his mother was a gross deviation from the care a reasonable, prudent person would exercise under the circumstances. Defendant could not complain that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-28-103 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient argued that the circuit court erred by granting the medical center's motion for summary judgment because the law of the case precluded the medical center from arguing that the patient's re-filed complaint against it was barred by the doctrine of charitable immunity. The supreme court found that there was an exception to the law of the case doctrine because the first appeal had been overruled. It did not prevent the circuit court from applying another decision, or from reaching the question of the medical center's entitlement to charitable immunity. There was evidence that the medical center was created and maintained exclusively for charity. The fact that the medical center received most of its funding through sources other than contributions or donations did not negate its overriding charitable purpose. Abolishment of charitable immunity was a public policy decision and was a matter for the General Assembly to decide. Ark. R. Civ. P. 56 was not unconstitutional. There were no factual disputes; instead, there were differing legal interpretations of undisputed facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the rape-shield statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-42-101 (Supp. 1999), which excluded inquiry at trial into a victim's irrelevant prior sexual conduct, was unconstitutional. The supreme court found that defendant's claim was not cognizable in an Ark. R. Crim. P. 37.1 petition. The contention advocated by defendant in the first point on appeal was the same argument made by him in the pretrial motion hearings, in the motion for new trial, and on direct appeal. Defendant could not use a Rule 37.1 petition to raise an issue again after previously raising it in the trial court. Defendant failed to show that a defense witness's testimony would have been allowed when the trial court ruled that the testimony was irrelevant. Counsel's failure to produce the expert's correspondence alone could not support a claim of ineffective assistance. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to move for dismissal based upon destruction of allegedly exculpatory evidence as the videotape did not contain either admissible or exculpatory information. Defendant had the ability to pursue a coram nobis writ while pursuing postconviction relief under Rule 37.1, but elected not to do so.</SPAN></P>
