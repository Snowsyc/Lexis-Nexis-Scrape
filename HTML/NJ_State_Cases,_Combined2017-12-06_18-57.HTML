Probation Association argued, the transfer was unconstitutional under N.J. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, para. 2, which required public employees to be selected on the basis of &quot;merit and fitness to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by examination, which, as far as practicable, shall be competitive,&quot; and because the AOC had not established a sufficient factual basis for the transfer under the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. HOLDINGS: [1]-The Commission failed to consider the constitutional issue at all; [2]-The AOC failed to establish a sufficient factual justification for the transfer under the applicable statutes and regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and remanded for further consideration by the Commission, which it instructed to consider the appropriateness of the proposed transfer for each title separately.</SPAN></P>

Because the trial court did not make adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning defendants' justification for maintaining the 21-day advance registration requirement in the face of the evidence submitted by plaintiffs that the requirement was no longer necessary to protect the integrity of the electoral process, the appellate court was constrained to reverse both decisions and remand for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Department exceeded its authority under N.J.S.A. &sect; 13:1E-125.4 by seizing control of the landfill without first obtaining judicial approval, and erred in basing the emergency order on past hydrogen sulfide emissions by applying a statutory emissions standard that did not yet exist until the applicable statute was enacted the same morning the order was issued; [2]-The Department had not made the requisite showing to justify an emergency order under &sect; 13:1E-125.9.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded that the Constitution did not compel that result because the certificates of relief did not alter the convictions, but merely removed certain disabilities normally attendant to them under New York law, and New Jersey was not constitutionally required to deem appellant not disqualified from obtain a firearm permit simply because New York saw fit to do so.</SPAN></P>

HOLDINGS: [1]-His Alcotest BAC reading was above the per se level of.08 prohibited by &sect; 39:4-50(a); he argued that admission of Alcotest results based on &quot;clear-and-convincing&quot; proof, coupled with the conclusively incriminating treatment of a BAC at or above.08, relieved the State of its constitutional burden of proving a guilt &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; He failed to distinguish the State's initial burden of establishing the Alcotest's admissibility from its ultimate burden of establishing guilt of a per se offense beyond a reasonable doubt; [2]-Even if a pretrial motion to suppress the BAC results was denied, a defendant could present evidence that the testing procedures were flawed and that his guilt had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landlords challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hudson County, in favor of plaintiff tenants. The tenants brought suit alleging that the landlords violated the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), N.J.S.A. &sect; 56:8-1 et seq., by charging rent in excess of that allowed by local rent control ordinances. The tenants had filed respective actions in lieu of prerogative writs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants had also challenged the local municipality's grant of the landlords' hardship rent increase request. At the hearing, the landlords claimed that the municipality's rent control ordinance was unconstitutional and that the legal base rent calculated under the ordinance was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. The trial court vacated the hardship rent increase and dismissed the landlords' challenge to the legal base rent calculations and, in ruling on motions for summary judgment, found in favor of the tenants on their CFA claim. The court entered final judgment in favor of the tenants for treble the amount of excess rent of $ 59,466, and for attorney fees and costs. The court upheld the grant of summary judgment to the tenants on their CFA claim because the landlords knew about the rent control ordinance, charged rent in excess of that ordinance, and were in the business of renting apartments. As such, the trial court properly concluded that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the landlords made an affirmative misrepresentation by raising the rents in violation of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court held that defendant was created pursuant to state law, N.J.S.A. &sect; 43:17-41, and was the direct recipient of taxes on certain fire insurance premiums, pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 54:18-1 and 54:18-2. The court further held that under N.J.S.A. &sect; 17:22-6.59, defendant was an independent State instrumentality and, therefore, a public agency, pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 47:1A-1.1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion judge found that plaintiff's complaint was not barred by the 2010 amendment to the Statute of Frauds, N.J.S.A. &sect; 25:1-5(h) (Amendment), requiring a writing memorializing palimony agreements and independent advice of counsel for each party in advance of executing any such agreement.

The court held that the trial court erred in finding that the Amendment applied only to palimony agreements entered after the January 18, 2010, effective date of the amendment. Since the purported palimony agreement between the parties did not comply with the Amendment, plaintiff's complaint failed to state a cause of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Camden County, which convicted him of harassment by communication, N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:33-4(a); harassment by alarming conduct, N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:33-4(c); bias intimidation, N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:16-1(a)(3); and, official misconduct, N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:30-2(a), following a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had worked for a township and his convictions arose from an incident in which an African-American co-worker was locked in an equipment cage and taunted. On appeal, defendant asserted that the bias intimidation statute,&nbsp;N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:16-1(a)(3), was unconstitutional. The court determined that &sect; 2C:16-1(a)(3) would be unconstitutional if it permitted a defendant to be convicted of a bias offense based on the victim's perception of the defendant's conduct, without requiring the State to prove defendant's biased intent in committing the underlying crime. Thus, to avoid an interpretation that would render the provision unconstitutional, and to effectuate the New Jersey Legislature's purpose in enacting the statute, as reflected in the legislative history, the court held that subsection (3) required proof of defendant's biased intent. Since the jury in the case was instructed that it could consider the victim's perception of the crime, rather than defendant's intent in committing it, that conviction required reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for bias intimidation as well as his conviction for official misconduct, because it was based solely on the underlying, invalid conviction for bias intimidation. The court affirmed the harassment convictions and remanded the case to the trial court for a re-trial on the charges of bias intimidation and official misconduct.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the ex-girlfriend asserted that the trial court erred in finding the evidence insufficient to support her complaint for domestic violence against the ex-boyfriend. The court disagreed, finding that the evidence established that she was not injured by the ex-boyfriend's vehicle but that she purposefully violated the order granting the ex-boyfriend exclusive possession of the home as she admitted the same, and the testimony from the ex-boyfriend was sufficient to show that she punched and smacked him in the face at least several times. The court also held that the ex-girlfriend understood her right to employ counsel and that she clearly and intentionally relinquished that right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A race horse breeders' association filed suit, seeking to reverse the New Jersey Governor's veto of the minutes of a meeting of the New Jersey Racing Commission and to remand the matter to the Commission with instructions to reconsider distribution of funds to stakeholders in New Jersey's horse racing and breeding industry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission decided to distribute $ 15 million collected by the New Jersey Casino Redevelopment Authority (CRDA) for the purpose of augmenting &quot;purse monies&quot; at New Jersey racing venues. The association challenged the constitutionality of the legislative scheme, adopted as part of the creation of the Atlantic City Tourism District, that expressly permitted the Commission to request the monies for this purpose and the CRDA to distribute them, but, at the same time, preserved the Governor's power under N.J.S.A. &sect; 5:5-22.1 to veto the Commission's minutes, thereby rendering any action taken null and void. The appellate court examined the various constitutional arguments made by the association and rejected them.  The association also argued that, even if the legislative scheme was constitutional and the Governor's veto permissible, his action was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. The appellate court concluded that its usual standard of review applicable to executive agency action did not apply to the discretionary actions of the Governor pursuant to the express legislative grant embodied in &sect; 5:5-22.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving under a suspended license in violation of N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:40-26(b). The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Ocean County, granted defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint; the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 2C:40-26(b), which became effective on August 1, 2011, made it a fourth-degree crime for a motorist to operate a vehicle at a time when his or her driver's license was suspended or revoked for a second or subsequent conviction for driving while intoxicated (DWI) or refusal to submit to an alcohol breath test. Defendant was charged with that crime, upon being found driving a car in September 2011 while his license was suspended due to multiple prior DWI offenses. The trial court dismissed the complaint, concluding that the application of &sect; 2C:40-26(b) to defendant violated ex post facto principles, essentially because his ongoing license suspensions had been imposed before &sect; 2C:40-26(b)'s effective date. The appellate court disagreed. It concluded that a violation of &sect;  2C:40- 26(b) comprised a new offense based upon new conduct, and that it did not impose retrospective punishment for a prior offense. Hence, the law could be constitutionally applied to drivers with suspended licenses, such as defendant, who were caught driving after August 1, 2011, regardless of whether their DWI-based suspensions were imposed before that date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing the criminal complaint was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Monmouth County, defendant was convicted of 10 counts of the second degree crime of endangering the welfare of a child (N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:24-4(a)). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a high school athletic coach, directed the student-victims to masturbate instead of having intercourse with girls, thereby avoiding unwanted pregnancies, and paid them to send him reports about their masturbatory practices. The appellate court held that the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant &quot;assumed responsibility for the care of a child&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 2C:24-4(a) by assuming the role of a regular supervisor in matters suitable for parental oversight and wholly unrelated to performance and behavior on the playing field. However, defendant's conviction for second-degree child endangerment could not stand because the trial court's jury instruction, patterned after the New Jersey Model Jury Charge, allowed for a conviction based on a relationship between defendant and student-victims not statutorily prescribed. The trial court directed the jurors that under appropriate circumstances, one who assumed responsibility for the care of a child could include a staff member of a school, but did not, however, explain what the &quot;appropriate circumstances&quot; were and effectively left the legal standard to the judgment of the jurors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The approved map established New Jersey State Senate and Assembly districts and the apportionment of State Senators and members of the General Assembly among those districts. Plaintiffs contended that the approved map violated various provisions of the New Jersey Constitution by failing to construct New Jersey Assembly districts as nearly compact and equal in the number of their inhabitants as possible and with no or as few as possible county or municipal splits. The trial court found that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim for relief. The court agreed with the trial court's dismissal, finding that it was obligated to follow New Jersey Supreme Court precedent which has established that counties cannot constitute separate districts and are not suitable building blocks for the formation of meaningful districts. The court found that the Commission reasonably viewed its task as unconstrained by a need to create districts within the borders of county lines and that plaintiffs did not make a showing that demographic data shifts had changed the facts from the 1970 Census in a way that would now allow for effective redistricting using county lines.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile commenced the action in the Family Part to contest the transfer, seeking return to the custody of the JJC and a declaration that the transfer regulations, N.J.A.C. 13:91-1.1 to 13:91-2.5, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether procedural due process rights should be accorded to an adjudicated juvenile prior to transfer from a juvenile facility operated by the JJC to an adult correctional facility operated by the DOC, pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. &sect; 52:17B-175(e), which permits such transfers. The court held that the rehabilitative purposes of the juvenile justice system combined with the importance of the decision in terms of the availability of rehabilitative services to juveniles at issue required due process at least as extensive as that required for prison discipline. The court held that at a minimum, before a juvenile can be transferred to custody of the DOC, there must be written notice of the proposed transfer and the supporting factual basis, an impartial decision maker, an opportunity to be heard and to present opposition, some form of representation, and written findings of fact supporting a decision to proceed with the transfer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with, inter alia, second-degree violation of a public safety law and recklessly causing death, N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:40-18(a). The predicate public safety law was the seat belt law, N.J.S.A. &sect; 39:3-76.2f.  Pursuant to a plea bargain, she tendered a guilty plea to a third-degree violation of &sect; 2C:40-18(a), which was accepted by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Sussex County. She then appealed her conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lost control of her car, which struck a guard rail; her 16-year-old passenger died of injuries sustained in the crash. Neither had been wearing a seat belt. Defendant was charged with her and her passenger's failure to wear a seat belt, in violation of &sect; 39:3-76.2f(a) and (b). She argued that the seat belt law was not a law &quot;intended to protect the public health and safety&quot; as contemplated by &sect; 2C:40-18(b). The appellate court disagreed. Section 39:3-76.2f was clearly a law addressed and enacted to protect the public health and safety, and &sect; 2C:40-18 had no express or implied limitations as to the type of public health and safety offense that could serve as a predicate violation. The appellate court rejected her claim that &sect; 2C:40-18 was unconstitutionally vague. It was not required to consider her hypothetical examples suggesting that violations of municipal ordinances that were arguably public health and safety laws could be elevated to more serious crimes through the application of &sect; 2C:40-18, as she could test the statute for vagueness as applied only with respect to her particular conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township argued that use of the equalization table was unconstitutional and statutorily prohibited. The township's expert did not know what impact there would be on the township's county taxes if the board uniformly stopped averaging in all county municipalities in which real estate markets were declining. As a result, the tax court found that the township had failed to proffer definite evidence that the average ratio promulgated in the county equalization table was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. It rejected the argument that N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 54:4-2.25 and 54:4-2.26 prohibited the board from apportioning the township's share of county taxes based on the average ratio of 94.34 percent since the ratio was based on an average true value in excess of the township's equalized true value. It clarified that &sect;&sect; 54:4-2.25 and 54:4-2.26 did not apply to the Director, but only to county boards of taxation. The tax court found that the township had failed factually to overcome the presumption in favor of the county equalization table, and rejected its statutory and constitutional arguments. The appellate court held that the tax court's analysis of the facts and the law was proper.</SPAN></P>

Taken together, they imposed no obligation on a registered mortuary to monitor unlicensed persons until after it assumed responsibility to direct the removal of human remains pursuant to &sect; 13:36-5.17(b) or did so at some later point between death and final disposition. Because the Board understood &sect;&sect; 13:36-4.9(c), 13:36-5.17(c), and 13:36-5.18(a) to require no more than reasonable efforts by registered mortuaries to ensure compliance with discernible objective standards in furtherance of the Board's obligation to protect the public health, these amendments were not impermissibly vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner parents, on behalf of themselves and their minor child, challenged a regulation enacted by respondent local board of education that allowed the board to suspend students from participating in extracurricular activities based on misconduct occurring off school grounds. The then acting commissioner of education invalidated the regulation. The board appealed and petitioners cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal presented a facial challenge to the validity of a regulation, promulgated by the board, that sought to control student conduct not only at school or during school related functions and activities, but at all other times and places. The regulation asserted this control by conditioning student participation in extracurricular activities on compliance with a specifically enumerated code of student conduct, without requiring a nexus between the alleged violation of law and school order or safety. The commissioner invalidated the regulation because it exceeded the authority conferred upon local school boards to regulate student conduct under N.J.A.C. 6A:16-7.1 and 6A:16-7.6. She found that &sect; 6A:16-7.6 allowed the board to suspend a student's participation in extracurricular activities for conduct away from school grounds only where 1) the activity substantially interfered with the requirements of discipline in the school's operation, and 2) the suspension was reasonably necessary for the student's physical or emotional safety and well-being or for the safety and well-being of other students, teachers, or school property. The appellate court agreed with this interpretation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner's determination was affirmed, and petitioners' cross-appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court approved the opinion of the tax court as consonant with the application of the doctrine of manifest injustice as expressed by a plurality of the New Jersey Supreme Court in its decision in Oberhand v. Director, Division of Taxation. Manifest injustice was an equitable principle that could be applied to relieve the adverse consequences of the retroactive application of amended tax legislation in circumstances in which such relief was warranted, and those circumstances were not present in the instant case. The tax court also properly ruled that the retroactive application of &sect; 54:38-1 did not violate the estate's equal protection or due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellant developers challenged the decision of respondent, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU), refusing to grant the case law decision entitled Centex full retroactive effect. In Centex, the court invalidated as ultra vires the 2005 BPU regulations known as the Main Extension Rules, N.J.A.C. 14:3-8.1 to 14:3-8.13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Main Extension Rules required utility companies to pay for the extension of utility lines to new homes in designated smart growth areas of the State of New Jersey, but forced the developer or the homeowner to absorb that cost in portions of the State that were not so designated. Despite the court's sweeping invalidation of the Main Extension Rules, BPU chose to afford the Centex decision only pipeline retroactivity, confining the benefit of Centex to only 18 developers, and denying the benefit of Centex to hundreds of others. The court held that because its opinion in Centex did not announce a new rule of law, but instead accomplished the reinstatement of a well-accepted and well understood century-long procedure, the pipeline retroactivity ordered by BPU was error. The court held that complete retroactivity of Centex was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed BPU's pipeline retroactivity decision. The court remanded the case to BPU for the adoption of a regulation establishing the procedures for granting refunds to all developers and homeowners affected by the ultra vires 2005 regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brother appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Family Part, Essex County, which granted plaintiff sister a final restraining order (FRO) against him under the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991 (the Act), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 2C:25-17 to 2C:25-35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were adult siblings who had not resided together since 1960, when they were both children. The court held that the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction even though the parties had not resided together for such a long period because the harassment of plaintiff by defendant over the intervening decades, although sporadic, conferred jurisdiction to issue the FRO in light of the fact that the present incidents arose directly from the parties' acrimonious family relationship and their status as former household members. The court affirmed the issuance of the ban on defendant from entering the township wherein plaintiff resided but found that a remand was necessary to hold a hearing to give defendant a fuller opportunity to describe his church attendance and any visits to his doctors. The court found no error with the trial court's findings that defendant's conduct constituted stalking and harassment as predicate findings under the Act, N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:25-19(a)(13)-(14), based on defendant picketing at plaintiff's residence as well as threatening plaintiff by means of offensive hand gestures, shouting curses at her, and blocking her exiting from her property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment but remanded the case to the Family Part for the limited purpose of entertaining defendant's request for a narrowing of the ban on his entry into the confines of the township.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed. In the context of publicly-bid contracts, the appellate court construed the term &quot;commencement of negotiations&quot; to be the date the bid was submitted. As appellant, because of its campaign contribution, was disqualified under &sect; 19:44A-20.14 on the date when bids were due, the Division properly ruled that it was not eligible to be awarded the contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Burlington County, which convicted him on drug offenses, in violation of N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:35-5(a)(1) and (b)(3) and, with regard to a 2009 indictment, third-degree controlled dangerous substance possession with the intent to distribute within 1000 feet of school property, in violation of N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:35-7, following his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from him following his arrest for defiant trespass because by the time of the search, the arresting officer did not possess probable cause that defendant had engaged in a defiant trespass because the owner of the property had posted a no loitering instead of a no trespassing sign. The court rejected defendant's arguments. The court found that the lateness of the hour, defendant's immediate departure from the property upon seeing the officer, and his excited and evasive demeanor when questioned were all specific and articulable facts that gave the officer a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Further, when defendant failed to assert that he was on the property with permission, the officer possessed probable cause to arrest him for defiant trespass. The court further held that no loitering was a message sufficient to convey the same meaning as no trespassing, therefore, such a direction did not preclude the officer from reasonably concluding that defendant was engaged in criminal activity by leaning against the porch of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a fair share housing organization, challenged an executive order of respondent, the Governor of the State of New Jersey, which abolished the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH), pursuant to the Executive Reorganization Act of 1969 (Reorganization Act), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 52:14C-1 to 52:14C-11.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">COAH was an administrative entity created and charged with implementing and administering the legislative mandates of the Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 52:27D-301 to 52:27D-329. At issue in the appeal was whether the Governor, pursuant to the Reorganization Act, had the power to abolish an independent agency created by the New Jersey Legislature that was in but not of a department of the Executive Branch. The narrower issue was whether the Governor could abolish COAH and transfer its duties, responsibilities, and obligations to the sole authority of an Executive Branch department. The court held that, in strictly construing the Reorganization Act, it did not grant the Governor the power to abolish a legislatively created, representative, independent authority that is in but not of the Executive Branch or any department in that branch of the government. The court held that the power to abolish COAH rested exclusively with the New Jersey Legislature and that, as an in but not of agency, COAH was not subject to the Reorganization Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff health service corporation (HSC) sued defendants, the New Jersey Division of Taxation, its Director, the New Jersey Department of Treasury, the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, and its Commissioner, seeking a tax refund and challenging N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:18A-6(b). The Superior Court of New Jersey, Tax Court, denied plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and granted defendants summary judgment motion. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, as the state's sole HSC, was required to serve as the insurer of last resort for the state of New Jersey. The appellate court concluded that New Jersey's Premium Tax Cap Statute,&nbsp;N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:18A-6, as amended by Assembly Bill A4401(A4401), L. 2005, c. 128, was not unconstitutional as a denial of due process or equal protection, a bill of attainder, or special legislation. By its terms A4401 eliminated the tax cap on premiums received by HSCs when at all relevant times, plaintiff was the only HSC in New Jersey. Among its other claims, plaintiff charged that it was singled out for retaliation after it refused to convert to for-profit status. The appellate court determined that A4401 was rationally related to the legislative goals of raising revenue to reduce a budget deficit as well as to eliminate a loophole in the tax law whereby HSCs had a lower effective tax rate than other health insurance carriers. It further concluded that plaintiff's claim of retaliation was likewise without merit. The trial court did not err in denying plaintiff's motion to compel discovery, and, in granting defendants summary judgment, did not improperly weigh the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Contending that the selective contracting law did not authorize the offering of the ancillary program in conjunction with a dental plan, the association brought the underlying action seeking to invalidate and enjoin the clauses in its members' contracts with the insurance carriers that were essential to the ancillary program. The association contended that by allowing the ancillary program for services, the Commissioner exceeded the authority delegated in the selective contracting law. The court disagreed and upheld the validity of N.J.A.C. 11:22- 5.10 and accepted the Commissioner's position that the Department had the authority to regulate insurance but not programs offering purchasers discounts on dental services under N.J.S.A. &sect; 17B:27A-54.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two appeals, defendant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Bergen County, which upheld her convictions finding her guilty of violating several city ordinances. The cases stemmed from the city's enforcement proceedings against defendant under its ordinance-based property maintenance code. Defendant was originally found guilty in a municipal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of defendant's convictions involved her refusal to let the city's construction and fire official inspect her rental property. The third conviction involved the municipal court finding defendant guilty of three property maintenance code violations. The court held that by exercising her constitutional right to refuse to participate in an unwarranted inspection, defendant could not be deemed to have created the circumstances that would criminalize her conduct and cause the forfeiture of the very rights she sought to exercise. The court adhered to the sentiment that an individual is not required to surrender her Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, protection on the say so of the inspector as the amendment gives her a constitutional right to refuse to consent and her asserting that right cannot be a crime. As a result, the court held that the city's criminalization of defendant's refusal to allow the inspections was not in accordance with the law. The court also noted that search warrants are required to conduct unconsented-to inspections. Thus, the ordinance was found unconstitutional as applied with regard to it authorizing warrantless inspections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and vacated defendant's convictions and sanctions for the ordinance violations and otherwise affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from shooting four people at an after-hours club. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred by imposing sentences of life without parole under the amended statute of N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:11-3(b)(4) in violation of ex post facto principles. The court disagreed, noting that the law in effect in 2005, when the murders were committed, provided that a person convicted of murder shall be sentenced to life without parole if the jury finds at least one aggravating factor, regardless of any mitigating factors. The court held that the jury found that the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed each murder while engaged in the commission of or attempt of the other murders and while engaging in a robbery, which were aggravating factors under the law in effect in 2005. As a result, the court was satisfied that the imposition of the four consecutive life sentences against defendant was not an ex post facto punishment. The court found no merit to defendant's other challenges raised on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff had been involved in a dispute for an unpaid bill with an electrician and filed a grievance against the electrician's attorney asserting that the attorney violated N.J.

The secretary of the district ethics committee advised plaintiff that his grievance was declined. Plaintiff asserted that R. 1:20-3(e)(6), which precluded an appeal of an undocketed grievance, violated his right to due process or equal protection of the laws. The court found that plaintiff failed to assert a viable constitutional basis for his challenge. The court found that plaintiff was dissatisfied with the procedure established by the disciplinary rules and the district ethics committee's decision but that did not translate into a cognizable claim in the court system.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Passaic County, which issued a judgment of acquittal on all counts of the indictment upon finding defendant not guilty by reason of insanity. Defendant was ordered committed to a psychiatric facility, pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:4-8(b)(3). Defendant had been indicted on charges of murder, unlawful possession of a knife, and possession of a weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from the stabbing death of his uncle. Defendant had pled not guilty to the charges and rejected the State's repeated overtures to agree to a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. After a bench trial, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Defendant had preferred and unsuccessfully sought to have a jury trial to seek acquittal on a theory of self-defense. The trial court followed State v. Khan, 175 N.J. Super. 72 (App.Div.1980), which prescribed a bifurcated procedure that gave primacy to the adjudication of an insanity defense. The court held that it declined to adhere to the bifurcation sequence set forth in Khan. Instead, the court held that a defendant who wishes to present a substantive defense based upon at least some evidence, or who otherwise wishes to put the State to its burden of proving the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, should not be required to first submit to a trial restricted to the issue of insanity. Thus, the court concluded that defendant was unfairly precluded from having a fact-finder fully consider a defense that could have resulted in his acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings on certain terms and conditions detailed in the opinion. The court also referred the many issues of procedural design and potential rule making implicated by the case for prospective consideration to the New Jersey Supreme Court's Committee on Criminal Practice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, representatives of a putative class of legal, resident immigrants who have resided in the United States for less than five years, sought emergent injunctive relief against defendants, various State of New Jersey officials and agencies, staying the enforcement of N.J.A.C. 10:78-3.2. That regulation adopted the standard of eligibility for federal Medicaid benefits and applied it to New Jersey's State-funded Medicaid program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.J.A.C. 10:78-3.2 adopted the standard of eligibility for federal Medicaid benefits contained in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), 8 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1601 to 1646, and applied it to New Jersey's FamilyCare Program, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 30:4J-8 to 30:4J-19, a State-funded Medicaid program. Pursuant to PRWORA, legal, resident immigrants who have not resided in the United States for at least five years were ineligible for federally-funded Medicaid benefits. Plaintiffs argued that N.J.A.C. 10:78-3.2 violated the FamilyCare program's enabling legislation and equal protection. The court determined, by applying the standards for preliminary injunctive relief, that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a legal right to relief and a reasonable probability of ultimate success. The court held that the means selected by defendants in adopting the federal eligibility criteria for aliens bore a real and substantial relationship to PRWORA's compelling governmental interest of assuring that aliens be self reliant in accordance with national immigration policy and New Jersey's interest in providing subsidized health insurance within the set appropriated limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Bergen County, which denied his motion to vacate his two convictions for failing to register as a sex offender, in violation of Megan's Law, N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:7-2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of it appearing that defendant, a juvenile, had not been adequately advised of the Megan's Law consequences of his plea of guilty to conduct that, if he were an adult, would constitute aggravated sexual assault, his plea was vacated and he was permitted to plead guilty to fourth-degree child abuse, an offense that was not subject to Megan's Law. Following that second plea, defendant moved to vacate two convictions that occurred in 1998 and 2000 for failure to register that had occurred in the interval between the first and second pleas. The trial court denied the motion to vacate upon concluding that the convictions for failure to register were based upon an adjudication that was in full force and effect at the time that the failures took place and were, therefore, validly entered. The court agreed, finding no statutory or equitable basis to vacate the two convictions for failure to register. The court found that nothing in Megan's Law suggested that the requirement of registration should be retroactively annulled because a plea to a crime subject to Megan's act was later withdrawn.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Somerset County, Municipal Appeal, which convicted him of being under the influence of a controlled dangerous substance (CDS) (N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:35-10(b)); possession of drug paraphernalia (N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:36-2); and operating a vehicle while knowingly having a CDS in his possession or in the motor vehicle (N.J.S.A. &sect; 39:4-49.1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first harmonize the two deadlines included in the Comprehensive Drug Reform Act, N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:35-19, and held that the 10-day period in which a defendant must object to the admission into evidence of a lab certificate, or else waive his right to confront the laboratory analyst, begins to run only after the State has provided all reports relating to the analysis in question. In doing so, the court resolved the ambiguity in the statute that required the State to serve its notice of intent to use a lab certificate and supporting data 20 days before trial, but required a defendant to object within 10 days of receiving only the notice of intent. As such, the court found that defendant's objection was timely with regard to the State's failure to comply with &sect; 2C:35-19 and that two of his convictions required reversal since both of those convictions may have rested, in part, on the lab certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part, the portion of the judgment convicting defendant for possession of drug paraphernalia. The court reversed defendant's convictions for being under the influence of a CDS and for operating a vehicle while knowingly having a CDS in his possession or in the motor vehicle and remanded that portion of the case to the municipal court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a decedent's alleged romantic partner, sued defendant estate, seeking palimony and other relief. The estate moved to dismiss the complaint and for leave to amend its counterclaim to include claims against plaintiff for fraud, perjury, attorneys fees, and punitive damages. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Family Part, Monmouth County, denied both motions. The estate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged she and the decedent had lived together in a &quot;marriage-like relationship&quot; and that he had agreed to take care of her financially. She alleged he told her that, in the event of his death, she would be cared for consistent with the lifestyle that they shared together. However, he did not provide for her in his will. After she filed the instant suit, the statute of frauds was amended to include palimony agreements among the types of &quot;agreements or promises&quot; that had to be in writing and signed by the parties in order to be enforceable (N.J.S.A. &sect; 25:1-5(h)). This case required the appellate court to determine whether to accord the amendment retroactive effect in a case filed against the deceased promisor's estate prior to the effective date of the amendment on an alleged palimony agreement enforceable when the complaint was filed. The appellate court concluded that the amendment applied prospectively and held that the trial court properly denied the estate's motion to dismiss the complaint. Plaintiff and decedent could not have anticipated the prerequisites to enforcement of a palimony promise when they were in a position to create such a document.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee prevailed in his suit against defendants, his former employer and its director, for violating New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 10:5-1 to 10:5-49. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Morris County, awarded him counsel fees but, pursuant to New Jersey's Punitive Damages Act (PDA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 2A:15-5.9 to 2A:15-5.17, remitted the jury's punitive damages award. Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants urged it was error not to either vacate the punitive-damage award or remit it to equal compensatory damages. The appellate court rejected plaintiff's claim that the trial court erred in remitting the punitive-damage award and using a multiplier of five times the compensatory damages, as this was allowed by LAD and N.J.S.A. &sect; 2A:15-5.14(b) of PDA. But, the emotional distress (ED) damages award had to be excluded from the multiplier on substantive due process grounds as he suffered no physical consequences from the distress caused by the discrimination and job loss and did not seek medical or psychological treatment, creating the inference that the ED award had a punitive component. As to attorney's fees, it excluded from the lodestar hours devoted to an unsuccessful motion--an unproductive use of time--but otherwise affirmed the lodestar.  The retainer agreement provided for an hourly fee plus a 100 percent fee enhancement, or one-third of the amount recovered, whichever was higher. These alternative fees in excess of the lodestar made an additional 25 percent contingency-fee enhancement inconsistent with the purposes served by such enhancements under Rendine v. Pantzer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The punitive damages and attorney's fees awards were reduced and the case was remanded to the trial court for entry of a judgment in conformity with the appellate court's decision.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were all females who were transferred from a prison for women to an all-male prison facility.

Thereafter, defendants transferred all women inmates back to the female facility and plaintiffs' action was dismissed as moot. Subsequently, plaintiffs moved from attorneys' fees as the prevailing parties. The trial court denied their application, finding they were not a prevailing party because they did not obtain a judgment on the merits. The court found error, concluding that the trial court erred by accepting at face value the factual allegations and legal positions advanced by defendants without affording plaintiffs the opportunity to challenge the veracity of the allegations proffered in an evidentiary hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, appealed the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Family Part, Camden County, which granted the motion of defendant, the New Jersey State Registrar, and determined that the New Jersey Parentage Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 9:17-38 to 9:17-59, did not permit the wife to be declared the parent of a child through a pre-birth adjudication commenced by plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife was infertile and plaintiffs arranged for the in vitro fertilization of an ovum furnished by an anonymous donor using the husband's sperm. Plaintiffs entered into a gestational surrogacy agreement with another woman, who carried the baby for them. Thus, the wife had no biological connection with the child. The State Registrar successfully moved to vacate the order declaring the wife as a parent. The court held that the provisions of the Parentage Act conferring paternity upon a husband either presumptively, pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 9:17-43(a), or by operation of law, pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 9:17-44, did not extend to automatically confer maternity on an infertile wife whose husband has a child via in vitro fertilization of a gestational carrier. The court held that neither statutory provision offended constitutional principles of equal protection because their different treatment of infertile married men and women was grounded in real physiological differences between the sexes and was necessary to protect the interests of the gestational carrier. Absent legislative reform, the wife's sole means of obtaining parentage to the child was through adoption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following trial, plaintiff homeowners appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Ocean County, which granted the motions for judgment filed by defendants, a borough, a township, and individual officers, and that awarded them $ 4,312.16 against defendant, the New Jersey State Police on their takings claim. The State Police cross-appealed the judgment. Plaintiffs alleged damages and constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs had filed suit against defendants alleging that in the course of executing a search warrant, defendants wantonly and maliciously inflicted damages on their premises, which was a multiunit boarding house.

Const. art. I, para. 20. Earlier, the borough, the township, and the individual officers were granted summary judgment and all claims were dismissed except the takings claim. The court reviewed case law holdings extensively and concluded that plaintiffs, as innocent property owners, were not entitled to compensation under the TCA, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, or, in the alternative, just compensation under U.S. Const. amend. V or N.J. Const. art. I, para. 20 since the property damage occurred as a result of the execution of a lawful search warrant. While the court recognized that plaintiffs suffered damages as a result of lawful government action, it held that such loss was not a taking and that the proper remedy must result from legislative action to provide relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, reversed the judgment on the cross-appeal and remanded the case to the trial court for entry of a judgment of dismissal. The court affirmed the judgment on the direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, 22 municipalities, challenged the validity of revised rules of respondent, the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing (COAH), adopted under the Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 52:27D-301 to 52:27D-329.19, which establish the obligations of municipalities to provide affordable housing during a third round period from 1999 to 2019. The court had previously invalidated substantial portions of the third round rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had remanded the case to COAH for the adoption of revised rules in conformity with the court's prior opinion. The revised rules were the subject of the underlying appeal. The court held that the growth share methodology for determining a municipality's share of the prospective regional need for affordable housing set forth in the revised third round rules were invalid. The court also invalidated N.J.A.C. 5:97-3.2(a)(4)(iv), which authorizes a municipality to obtain substantive certification of a compliance plan that proposes to construct municipally-funded affordable housing without any specifics regarding the location of the site or source of funding; those parts of the third round rules that fail to provide sufficient incentives for the construction of inclusionary developments. Likewise, N.J.A.C. 5:97-3.5, which governs rental bonuses for prior round obligations was invalidated as was N.J.A.C. 5:97-3.18, which authorizes compliance bonuses for affordable housing units approved during the period from December 20, 2004 to June 2, 2008.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court invalidated substantial portions of the rules and remanded the case to the COAH to adopt new third round rules that use a methodology for determining prospective need similar to the methodologies used in the first and second rounds. The court noted that the determination should be made on the basis of the most up-to-date available data and that the remand shall be completed within five months.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant club challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Middlesex County, which granted plaintiff borough's application to permanently enjoin it from operating its sexually oriented business at a particular location. The borough had filed a complaint alleging that the location and the nature of the club's activities violated N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:34-7 and the licensing requirements of its ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club operated a sexually oriented business featuring live nude erotic dancing. Applying N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:34-7 and the licensing requirements of the borough's local ordinance, the trial court permanently enjoined the club from operating that business at its location. The trial court also ordered that the injunction be recorded in the office of the county registrar of deeds as a restriction on the use of the property in perpetuity. The court identified a Supreme Court of New Jersey case applicable to evaluating an as-applied challenge to &sect; 2C:34-7. The court found that the trial court erred by concluding that the borough had met its burden of identifying the club's relevant market area since the two experts that testified did not address regional marketing patters or available public transportation and other factors. The court further held that the internet was not a reasonably viable alternative forum for the constitutionally protected form of expression at issue. The court also determined that the trial court had no authority to impose the deed restriction on the use of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for it to reconsider its ruling by applying all of the relevant case law factors. The court held that regardless of how the trial court ruled on remand, there was no legal ground for sustaining the order imposing a judicially crafted restriction on the use of the property that ran with the land in perpetuity. The court rejected the borough's cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A municipal court found defendant guilty of four counts of violating the New Jersey Smoke-Free Air Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 26:3D-55 to 26:3D-55-64. He appealed; the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County, convicted defendant on each of the violations and imposed the same sentences as had been imposed in municipal court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A health inspector issued four summons alleging that defendant violated the Act in his hookah bar. Defendant's wife testified that there was no tobacco in any of the products and that they did not permit smoking of any tobacco on the premises. The instant court held that the Act was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad under N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, para. 1 as applied to defendant's hookah bar. The Act provided &quot;fair warning&quot; by requiring prior written notification of prohibited conduct under N.J.S.A. &sect; 26:3D-62(b). No one of common intelligence had to guess at the Act's meaning. The Act did not deprive defendant of the right to acquire, possess, and protect property under N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, para. 1, but merely denied him the option of permitting smoking within his premises. In the absence of constitutional infirmity, the question whether the Act had to be amended to explicitly include or exclude defendant's conduct was left to the legislature. As there was no indication that the written notification required by &sect; 26:3D-62(b) was provided to defendant before the first summons was issued, the record was insufficient to support a conviction under that summons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, school superintendents, an assistant superintendent, and an association of school administrators, sued defendant New Jersey Commissioner of Education, challenged regulations adopted by the Commissioner in 2008 entitled &quot;Fiscal Accountability, Efficiency and Budgeting Procedures,&quot; N.J.A.C. 6A:23A-1.2 to -22.15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged N.J.A.C. 6A:23A-3.1(e)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) and (11) and certain provisions of N.J.A.C. N.J.A.C. 6A:23A-5.2(a). The appellate court rejected the argument that the regulations were an impermissible taking, unconstitutionally vague, a violation of equal protection, and ultra vires. Pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:7-8(j), the Commissioner had the authority to promulgate the challenged regulations. The appellate court agreed, however, that certain of the regulations violated the tenure statute,&nbsp;N.J.S.A. &sect; 18A:28-5, and were thus invalid. While superintendents had no property rights in future employment contracts, and untenured assistant superintendents had only contingent rights in such contracts, under &sect; 18A:28-5, tenured assistant superintendents could not be dismissed or reduced in compensation except for cause. Section 6A:23A-3.1(e)(3), (4), (5), and (6) improperly served to deprive certain administrators of vested rights and to reduce the compensation of tenured assistant superintendents. As &sect; 6A:23A-5.2(a)(2)(iv) and (a)(4) affected school districts, not plaintiffs, they lacked standing to challenge these provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Family Part, Hudson County, found that defendant husband had assaulted and harassed plaintiff wife, in violation of the New Jersey Prevention of Domestic Violence Act (PDVA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 2C:25-17 to 2C:25-35. It dismissed the wife's PDVA complaint, vacated a prior temporary restraining order, and denied her request to issue a permanent restraining order. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On three occasions, the husband physically abused his wife, leaving multiple bruises; he also had nonconsensual sex with her several times. The trial court found that the nonconsexual sex did not constitute sexual assault (N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:14-2) or criminal sexual contact (N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:14-3) because the husband did not have the requisite criminal intent, as he believed his conduct was permitted by his religion. The appellate court held that this was error. As neither crime specified a mental state, the husband's knowing conduct was sufficient to establish the elements of both offenses. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, did not require the trial court to exempt the husband, a practicing Muslim, from a finding that he committed the predicate acts of sexual assault and criminal sexual contact and thus violated the PDVA. The trial court erred in refusing to issue a final restraining order, as it inappropriately relied on restraints that may or may or may not have issued in the parallel criminal proceeding, and it failed to give sufficient consideration to the parties' future contact with each other due to the imminent birth of their child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for entry of a final restraining order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff students appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, General Equity, Essex County, which granted the motion to dismiss, pursuant to R. 4:6-2(e), filed by defendants, the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education and others. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 18A:36A-10 and 18A:36A-12, regarding charter school funding, violated their equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged N.J.S.A. &sect; 18A:36A-10, which barred charter schools from receiving state or local funding for facilities, and N.J.S.A. &sect; 18A:36A-12, which provided only 90 percent per pupil funding for operational costs to charter schools as opposed to 100 percent of eligible facilities costs provided to traditional public schools. Plaintiffs contended that the funding disparity violated their equal protection rights under N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted based on established precedent, which held that the equal protection analysis was not applicable to school funding issues and because the complaint failed to set forth a viable equal protection challenge. The court agreed, finding that plaintiffs' allegation of inequality between the charter schools and traditional public schools was based solely upon the disparity in funding. As a result, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate how they were deprived of the equal opportunity to attend the fully funded traditional public schools available to them in their city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee sued defendants, a township and police officers, alleging false arrest and false imprisonment under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act (TCA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 59:1-1 to 12-3, and asserting a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim for violation of his constitutional rights. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County, dismissed the TCA claim and granted defendants summary judgment on the &sect; 1983 claim. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was arrested based upon a mistaken identification. The appellate court held that the trial court properly dismissed plaintiff's &sect; 1983 claim on summary judgment because a careful review of the undisputed facts revealed that a reasonable police officer would have believed there was probable cause to arrest plaintiff. That was a determination appropriately made by the trial court. As plaintiff showed no link between the township's alleged absence of valid procedures and the asserted &sect; 1983 violation, the township was entitled to summary judgment. The trial court also properly dismissed plaintiff's TCA claim because plaintiff failed to provide timely notice pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 59:8-8. His receiving wrong advice from an attorney about the accrual date of his false arrest claim, and his desire not to aggravate police, were not &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; under N.J.S.A. &sect; 59:8-9 justifying his failure to file a notice of claim within 90 days of its accrual. After reviewing in camera the certain documents plaintiff requested in discovery, as the trial court concluded they were not relevant to his claims against the township, it properly denied his discovery request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Jersey Governor's Office of Employee Relations (OER) rejected the request of appellant, an independent police union, for paid leave for some of its members and trustees to attend a convention. Appellant sued respondent, the State of New Jersey, seeking a declaration that N.J.S.A. &sect; 11A:6-10 violated the ban on special legislation set forth in N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 7, as well as the equal protection rights of its members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant represented law enforcement officers holding the rank of captain or its equivalent. OER denied its request for paid leave for its members and trustees to attend as delegates a state convention hosted by appellant and another union, on grounds appellant was not affiliated with any of the unions named in &sect; 11A:6-10 or N.J.A.C. 4A:6-1.13.  Appellant argued that &sect; 11A:6-10 was special legislation as its limitation to four unions was arbitrarily exclusive, and, for the same reason, violated the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The court held that the police and firefighters paid convention leave statute,&nbsp;&sect; 11A:6-10, was not unconstitutional as special legislation and did not violate the equal protection rights of members of employee organizations not affiliated with the unions designated in the statute. As the vast difference in size and diversity sufficiently distinguished the groups excluded, the statutory classification was at least &quot;fairly debatable.&quot; And as the classification rested on a rational basis relevant to the statute's educational purpose, &sect; 11A:6-10 passed the rational basis test and therefore defeated appellant's equal protection claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">OER's ruling was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that EO14 was authorized both statutorily and constitutionally, despite &sect; 18A:7F-7's command that such excess surplus funds be used for the next year's school budget.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County, which denied his motion to suppress evidence. Defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty to second-degree possession of cocaine with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school, in violation of N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:35-5(a)(1) and (b)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from warrantless police searches of his person and his residence. Evidence of crack cocaine was found on defendant's person following his arrest and, after his wife consented to the search of their apartment, additional contraband was found. The court held that the evidence seized from the apartment should have been suppressed because in the absence of a warrant or a recognized exception from the warrant requirement under U.S. Const. amend. IV, the police could not lawfully enter defendant's home to conduct a Terry-type detention and investigation of him. The court found that a police officer's wedging herself in the doorway to prevent defendant from closing his front door was entry into the home and that the police failed to show either hot pursuit exigent circumstances or a community caretaking exception from the warrant requirement. Although the police entry was unlawful, defendant had no right to resist physically, and the search of his person incident to his arrest was lawful. However, consent to search defendant's apartment, given by his wife, was tainted by the unconstitutional police conduct and was not shown to be voluntary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff neighborhood association sued defendants, a city council and developers, challenged a redevelopment plan amendment relaxing height and density requirements that was proposed by the developers and adopted by the council. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hudson County, dismissed the complaint with prejudice; plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The council had designated an area as in need of redevelopment under New Jersey's Local Redevelopment and Housing Law (LRHL), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 40A:12A-1 to 40A:12A-1-73. The appellate court held that the trial court properly applied the arbitrary and capricious standard. It rejected plaintiff's claim that as the redevelopment plan was successful, it could not be amended; the LRHL neither precluded amendment of a successful redevelopment plan or required that it forever depend upon the initial impetus for the blight designation. The council's adoption of the amendment was not arbitrary or capricious, as it had adequate support in the record. Plaintiff's claim that the blight designation was stale when certain lots were included in the plan 29 years later failed. As approval of an amendment to a redevelopment plan was governed by N.J.S.A. &sect; 40A:12A-7, not N.J.S.A. &sect; 40A:12A-5, which governed only an initial blight designation, the council need not have reevaluated any of the properties under the criteria of &sect; 40A:12A-5 while it adopted a redevelopment plan under &sect; 40A:12A-7. And plaintiff's four-year acquiescence to the inclusion of those lots estopped it from challenging it later.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant labor unions brought suit against respondents, the Governor of New Jersey and others challenging Executive Order Number 7 (EO 7), signed by the Governor, which attempted to extend labor unions and labor organizations certain pay-to-play restrictions on political campaign contributions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants consisted of six labor unions that were representatives of more than 300,000 public employees. Appellants asserted that EO 7 was unconstitutional in numerous respects in that it conflicted with the terms of existing legislation and thereby infringed upon principles of separation of powers, in violation of N.J. Const. art. III, para. 1. The court held that paragraph one of EO 7 violated principles of separation of powers and invalidated it to the extent that it was written or intended to be construed to cover labor unions and collective bargaining agreements. The court concluded that paragraph one of EO 7, at least insofar as it was intended to treat collective bargaining agreements as contracts and labor unions as business entities, was so fundamentally incompatible with existing laws and statutes that it impaired the essential integrity of the constitutional powers of the New Jersey Legislature. The court held that an executive order could not bypass the Legislature and carry out what would be, in effect, an implied repealer of existing legislation addressing pay-to-play restrictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated paragraph one of EO 7 as exceeding the Governor's executive power. The court held that in the interests of accommodating potential review by the New Jersey Supreme Court, its determination was effective July 1, 2010, unless the Governor filed a timely notice of appeal or petition for certification, in which event the effective date shall be stayed pending further order of the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff recall committee appealed the final administrative determination of defendant, the New Jersey Secretary of State, declining to accept its notice of intention to recall a particular United States Senator. N.J. Const. art. I, para. 2 and the Uniform Recall Election Law, N.J.S.A. &sect; 19:27A-2, permitted such a petition, but the Secretary declined to accept the filing. Defendant, the Director of the Division of Elections, was also a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The particular Senator at issue was made an indispensible party and various amicus curiae participated in the case. The Secretary's decision was based on her determination that the qualifications and election of a member of the United States Senate was a matter of exclusive jurisdiction of federal authority and that neither the United States Constitution nor federal statute provided for a recall proceeding for a federally-elected official. The court acknowledged the overwhelming margin that the recall provision set forth in N.J. Const. art. I, para. 2 was approved by New Jersey voters. The court determined that the recall measures approved by the citizens of New Jersey, and implemented via N.J.S.A. &sect; 19:27A-2, were clear and unambiguous and authorized the recall of a United States Senator in New Jersey. The court found no federal constitutional provision precluding States from adopting legislation for the recalling of a United States Senator and that the New Jersey recall process was not so clearly invalid under federal law as to require a drastic, preemptive judicial declaration thwarting the will of the voters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the Secretary to accept and file the petition and to proceed under the statute. The court noted that in ordering that ministerial act, it was not passing on the ultimate validity of the recall process at issue. The court stayed its decision until such time as defendants or the Senator filed a timely notice of appeal or petition for certification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged the final decision of respondent, the New Jersey Department of Corrections, finding him guilty of disciplinary infraction *.011, which was defined in N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1 as possession or exhibition of anything related to a security threat group (STG).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On September 23, 2008, three handwritten letters were seized during a search of the inmate's cell. At the disciplinary hearing, the letters were received in evidence. An intelligence investigator who had received training as a gang investigator prepared a report, which stated that two of the three letters contained STG related material. The hearing officer found the inmate guilty of *.011, and he received a sanction of 15 days detention, 180 days administrative segregation, and 180 days loss of commutation time. On appeal, the inmate asserted that the regulation was unconstitutionally vague. The court reviewed disciplinary infraction *.011, as defined in N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1, and determined that it was neither facially vague nor unconstitutionally vague as applied. The court found that, at a minimum, the regulation provided proper notice of the prohibited conduct and what constituted prohibited literature related to STGs. In response to the inmate's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the court found that the evidence relied upon by the hearing officer provided the required substantial evidence to support the disciplinary violation against him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a teachers union and some of its members, sued defendants, the State of New Jersey, its legislature, and its current and former treasurers, seeking to redress shortfalls in the State's statutorily-mandated contributions to the New Jersey Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF). After a bench trial, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, that the legislature's failure to fund TPAF in the amounts certified by the TPAF actuary violated the Contracts, Due Process, and Unlawful Taking Clauses of the New Jersey and U.S. Constitutions; violated the Uniformity of Taxation and Debt Limitation Clauses of the New Jersey Constitution; and violated the New Jersey Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund Law, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 18A:66-1 to -93, -3 (TPAF Act). The appellate court held that members of TPAF, although entitled by law to the receipt of vested benefits upon retirement, possessed no constitutionally protected contract right to the particular level, manner, or method of State funding provided by statute. The New Jersey Constitutional created no contractual right to retirement benefits or to future legislative appropriations. Moreover, granting members the contract rights they claimed would run afoul of the Appropriations Clause, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, para. 2, and the Debt Limitation Clause, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, para. 3, which granted the legislature exclusive powers of appropriation and precluded one legislature from binding future legislatures regarding prospective appropriations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a limited liability company, appealed the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Burlington County, which dismissed its action in lieu of prerogative writs challenging the constitutionality and statutory validity of an ordinance adopted by defendant township, which imposed certain registration obligations and other regulatory requirements on landlords within the township.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owned and operated a 450-unit apartment complex located within the township. Plaintiff facially challenged the constitutionality and statutory validity of the ordinance, and argued that the ordinance was not for a valid public purpose; violated due process and separation-of-powers principles of the United States Constitution and the New Jersey Constitution; and that it was preempted by the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 55:13A-1 to - 28, and by other state statutes. The court upheld the dismissal of plaintiff's claims, essentially for the same reasons as the trial court. The court, quoting much of the trial judge's opinion, held that N.J.S.A. &sect; 55:13A-25(b) was clear and contained an explicit expression that preemption was never intended. The court held that not only did the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law not preempt municipal action, but that none of the rules or regulations promulgated pursuant to it could preempt a municipality from acting in the field. The court further found that plaintiff failed to provide any extrinsic evidence of an invalid purpose for enactment of the ordinance, therefore, the presumption of its validity remained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a deceased inmate's estate, sued defendants, New Jersey Department of Corrections officials and prison administrators and employees, alleging common law tort and federal civil rights claims based on defendants' alleged delayed response to another prisoner's attack on the inmate, resulting in his death. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County, granted defendants summary judgment; plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed the attack was delayed by a prison policy dictating supervision of the mess hall from protective cages above the floor rather than direct floor patrol, and by assembling two emergency response teams rather than one before interceding. Plaintiff also sought to hold defendants liable for failing to remove the attacking inmate from the prison's general population, as he suffered from psychological problems. The appellate court approved the summary judgment dismissal of plaintiff's complaint, finding the individual state defendants immune from state tort claims under N.J.S.A. &sect; 59:5-2(b)(4) in the absence of any evidence of willful misconduct. As to the federal civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the appellate court also found no proof of a constitutional violation, that is, no evidence defendants acted with a deliberate indifference to a substantial risk to decedent in violation of the &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; ban of the Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Moreover, because it discerned no violation of a clearly established constitutional right, it held the individual state defendants had a qualified immunity from liability under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a domestic violence complaint against defendant. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Family Part, Essex County, entered a final restraining order in favor of plaintiff pursuant to the New Jersey Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 2C:25-17 to -35.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the parties were in a dating relationship and that defendant made terroristic threats and harassed plaintiff. Defendant argued that plaintiff did not qualify as a domestic violence victim because he paid for her company. The appellate court examined the factors relevant to determining whether a dating relationship existed for purposes of the Act and concluded that plaintiff was not automatically disqualified from claiming a dating relationship solely because defendant may have paid plaintiff for her company. Defendant testified that his payments to plaintiff were meant to help her out financially and were not necessarily in exchange for her time. In response to questioning by the trial court, he agreed that he and plaintiff dated. Further, plaintiff testified she and defendant were girlfriend and boyfriend. The trial court's findings that defendant committed acts of domestic violence, in that his communications constituted terroristic threats or were otherwise acts of harassment, were supported by credible evidence. The legislature was not constitutionally required to impose a clear-and-convincing standard for adjudication of domestic violence matters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Rate Counsel was the statutorily designated representative of the State's utility ratepayers. Rate Counsel challenged the order on both constitutional and procedural grounds and also asserted that the BPU's decision was arbitrary and capricious. The court rejected Rate Counsel's arguments that the BPU's action should be reversed because it violated the contract clause of the Constitutions of the United States and New Jersey, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and N.J. Const., art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 3; it violated statutorily granted rights to notice of a hearing; it violated its procedural due process rights; and it was arbitrary and capricious and not based on credible evidence. The court concluded that the BPU properly approved the pass-through to utility ratepayers of a portion of the costs of the SRECs. The court noted that possible modification of the Supplier Master Agreement was expressly reserved by the enabling document. The court further noted the broad authority granted to the BPU over proceedings and decisions involving policy decisions by the BPU concerning the provision of electric supply and the allocation of costs under N.J.S.A. &sect; 48:3-57.</SPAN></P>

I, para. 7, defendant moved to suppress drugs seized after an investigatory stop. After the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County, denied the motion, defendant pled guilty to possession of cocaine. He then appealed the denial of his suppression motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a recent homicide at a housing complex, police went to the complex to deter a possible retaliatory shooting. When defendant recognized the officers as police, he pedaled away on a bicycle despite their commands to stop. After two officers grabbed him, he threw away a box of cocaine. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged or about to engage in criminal activity. However, the trial court erred in ruling that defendant's apparent violation of the obstruction statute,&nbsp;N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:29-1, provided sufficient grounds to justify the stop. Flight from an unconstitutional investigatory stop that could justify an arrest for obstruction did not automatically justify admission of evidence revealed during that flight. For such evidence to be admissible, there had to be a &quot;significant attenuation&quot; between the unconstitutional stop and seizure of evidence. As only four or five seconds elapsed between the order to stop and defendant's discarding the cocaine, and there were no significant &quot;intervening circumstances&quot; between the two events, the State failed to show significant attenuation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying defendant's motion to suppress was reversed and the judgment of conviction was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a financial company, appealed various orders of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hudson County, which awarded  injunctive relief and a civil penalty to defendant consumers, pursuant to the Truth-in-Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act (TCCWNA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 56:12-14 to -18. Plaintiff's suit sought collection of amounts due under retail installment contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The award to defendants was based upon violations of consumer rights provided in the Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 17:16C-1 to -61, and the Door-to-Door Retail Installment Sales Act (DDRISA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 17:16C-61.1 to -61.9. Plaintiff accepted assignments of retail installment contracts entered into by defendants for vacuum cleaners sold door-to-door. The court rejected plaintiff's claim that class certification was improper in the case because only one of the several sellers was involved in the purchase made by the class representative. The court found that the common nucleus of fact in the action was the content and form of the contract and notices by plaintiff and used in each transaction. Thus, class certification was held proper. The court affirmed the TCCWNA penalty because the contract violated a consumer right provided by RISA and the aggregate award was neither unconstitutionally excessive nor a basis for decertification of the class. The court did modify the injunctive relief to conform the same with federal regulations, which preempted and precluded enforcement of several but not all of the provisions of the DDRISA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, in part, the orders of the trial court with regard to finding a violation of the DDRISA based upon the typeface included in the contracts and the attorney fee award in favor of defendants' counsel. The court further ordered modification of the injunction. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant sought review of a police chief's denial of his application for a permit to purchase a firearm pursuant to to N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:58-3. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, affirmed the denial of the application. The applicant appealed; respondent State opposed the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court did not hear testimony, but based its ruling solely on documentary evidence, including letters from the applicant's references and the report of his psychiatrist. The appellate court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which held that the Second Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. II, protected an individual right to keep and bear arms, had no effect upon the constitutionality of &sect; 2C:58-3, which required a permit to purchase a firearm. The trial court's failure to conduct a hearing on the appeal from the denial of the application for a firearms purchaser permit within the 30-day period allowed by &sect; 2C:58-3(d) did not require automatic approval of the application. The trial court erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing on an appeal from the denial of the application for a firearms purchaser permit and instead deciding the appeal based on evidence submitted to the trial court ex parte in the form of telephone calls by the trial court to the applicant's former employers and an unsolicited letter submitted after argument of the appeal that commented negatively upon the applicant's fitness to possess a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's affirmance of the denial of the application was reversed and the case was remanded for an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff farmers appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, which dismissed their declaratory judgment action against defendants, the State of New Jersey, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council (Council), and the New Jersey Water Supply Authority. The farmers alleged statutory violations involving preserved areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farmers all owned tracts of land created by the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act (Highlands Act), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 13:20-1 to -35. In lieu of an answer, defendants moved to dismiss the farmers' complaint. The trial court upheld the Highlands Act on due process and other grounds, dismissed the challenge to the Council's action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the issue was a final decision of a state administrative agency, and that there was no legal merit to the remaining claims. The court held that the Council's failure to adopt a Master Plan within the statutory 18-month time period set forth in N.J.S.A. &sect; 13:20-8(a) did not invalidate any subsequent adoption of the plan. The court further upheld the trial court's finding that the economic activity of farming did not fall within a protected right or economic or suspect classification. The court rejected the farmers' equal protection arguments and held that the farmers failed to articulate how the Highlands Act impeded their right or ability to farm and noted that the farmers had the opportunity to seek waivers. The court further upheld the constitutionality of the Highlands Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hunterdon County, granted summary judgment to plaintiff township and entered a condemnation judgment granting it title to a portion of defendant condemnee's property. While the condemnee's appeal was pending, the trial court allowed the township to withdraw money from its trust fund in order to pay post-taking real estate taxes on the property; the condemnee appealed this order as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property the township condemned included an airport. The appeal raised two critical issues of law. The first was the preemptive effect of state aviation statutes, specifically the New Jersey Air Safety and Zoning Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect;  6:1-80 to 84, -88, and the New Jersey State Aviation Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 6:1-20 to -44, and regulations on land use authority. The second was the application of the principles enunciated in Mount Laurel Twp. v. MiPro Homes. The condemnee claimed that the taking was pretextual in an attempt to limit the use of airport property. As to this claim, the appellate court concluded that the condemnee presented a sufficient factual basis to overcome a motion for summary judgment; it further concluded that state statutes preempted certain aspects of local land use, constraining a municipality's exercise of its condemnation authority (Garden State Farms, Inc. v. Bay). In a consolidated appeal, the appellate court further concluded that under the New Jersey Eminent Domain Act of 1971, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 20:3-1 to -50, title passed to the township upon the filing of the declaration of taking, and the township improperly assessed taxes against the condemnee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the summary judgment and remanded for trial on the issues raised by its opinion, including which, if any, of the parcels named in the township's condemnation action fell outside of the airport facilities area and safety zone, and the condemnee's arbitrariness claim. The order for withdrawal of funds was vacated; the trial court was to ensure that the condemnee was reimbursed for any money paid from the trust fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borough contended that the facility was not organized exclusively for hospital purposes, was not used actually and exclusively for hospital purposes, and was designed to generate at profit. The borough also asserted that the facility made no provisions to provide for charitable care and provided none. In interpreting &sect; 54:4-3.6, the Tax Court found that nursing homes and assisted living facilities were eligible for exemption from local property taxes, even if not part of or integrated into a hospital facility, but only if those facilities provide some measure of charitable care. The court held that the Tax Court judge erroneously inserted an additional qualification in &sect; 54:4-3.6 that did not exist by imposing the charitable care component upon an assisted living facility for it to qualify for tax exemption under that hospital purposes provision. The court found that there was no ambiguity in the statute and that its plain language did not require an assisted living facility to provide charity care in order to qualify for the exemption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order denying the facility's tax exemption for tax year 2002 and remanded the case to the Tax Court for a determination of when the facility was substantially completed. The court further reversed the orders denying the facility's tax exemption for tax years 2003 and 2004.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police officers sued defendants, a city and others. Officer one alleged a N.J.S.A. &sect; 40A:9-6 violation; officer two alleged malicious prosecution and invasion of privacy. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County, dismissed officer two's non-economic damages claims as barred by the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 59:1-1 to 14-4. A jury returned a verdict for the officers. Defendants and officer two appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officer one alleged he was not compensated for his service as a de facto police sergeant or lieutenant. The appellate court held that the trial court was mistaken when it determined as a matter of law that defendants were liable in damages to officer one on his claim for service as the de facto supervisor of the traffic unit, because the proofs conflicted as to whether he held that office on a de facto basis. It rejected defendants' argument that his damages had to be limited to back pay, determining that if past and future pension benefits were found to be owing on retrial, defendants, not the New Jersey Division of Pensions, would be responsible for payment. Officer two sought economic and non-economic damages for malicious prosecution pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 2A:47A-1 and non-economic damages for invasion of privacy. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's determination that the claims were subject to the Tort Claims Act's injury threshold. Since that threshold was not met, officer two was entitled only to economic damages for malicious prosecution. It affirmed the dismissal of his non-economic damage claims based on malicious prosecution and invasion of privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of officer two's cause of action for invasion of privacy and his claim for non-economic damages arising from his malicious prosecution cause of action was affirmed. The judgment in favor of officer one was reversed and the matter was remanded for a new trial as to whether he was the de facto supervisor of the traffic unit, utilizing the standards expressed in Jersey City v. Dept. of Civil Service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Monmouth County, which convicted her of reckless driving, in violation of N.J.S.A. &sect; 39:4-96. In addition to a fine and costs, the municipal judge imposed a 45 day driver's license suspension pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 39:5-31. At issue in the case was the continued viability and constitutionality of &sect; 39:5-31.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to find her guilty of reckless driving and that if her conviction was sustained, the portion of her sentence imposing the 45-day driver's license suspension should be vacated. Defendant contended that &sect; 39:5-31 was antiquated and should be given no effect, and that it should be declared unconstitutional because it is vague, overbroad, provided insufficient notice to the public, and was capable of widely disparate application in that it gave judges unbridled discretion. The court found that the evidence supported the municipal judge's findings and conclusions that defendant was guilty of reckless driving, particularly based on the testimony of an officer, who observed her passing in a left turn lane in an intersection. The court rejected defendant's constitutional and repeal by implication challenges to &sect; 39:5-31. The court held that &sect; 39:5-31, and the point system under the Motor Vehicle Code set forth in N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 39:5-30 to -30.11, harmoniously coexisted, with each given effect. The court addressed the overbreath and vagueness arguments asserted by defendant and found no merit to either.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an insured's employee, sued defendant insurer to compel arbitration of her claim for underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits. Third-party defendant, plaintiff's personal auto insurance carrier, was made a party. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Camden County, applying the so-called &quot;Scutari Amendment,&quot;  N.J.S.A. &sect; 17:28-1.1(f), enacted after the suit was filed, granted summary judgment to plaintiff. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a passenger in her employer's car when she was injured in a collision caused by another motorist. She settled with the motorist for policy limits and then made a claim for UIM benefits under her employer's policy. Defendant denied the claim, contending that as her personal policy had a UIM limit of  $ 100,000, the step-down provision in the employer's policy became operational. As a result, the available UIM limit under the policy was  $ 100,000; thus, the motorist's vehicle was not underinsured, and plaintiff had no claim for UIM benefits. The trial court held that the Scutari Amendment, which required a business entity's insurer to provide the same UIM coverage to its insured's employees as it did to the named insureds, applied retroactively. Contrary to the result reached by its colleagues in Olkusz v. Brown, the appellate court concluded that the legislature implicitly intended the Scutari Amendment to be applied retroactively. However, under the facts of this case, to do so would have resulted in a manifest injustice to defendant, as prior law gave it a reasonable basis to believe that the policy provisions at issue were enforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings to resolve the issue of whether plaintiff was covered by third-party defendant's policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County, which committed him to the Special Treatment Unit, pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 30:4-27.24 to -27.38. Prior to appellant's release from prison, the State filed a petition to civilly commit him under the SVPA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had been incarcerated for various crimes, including sexual offenses. His primary contention on appeal was that the SVPA was punitive because he was not afforded sex offender treatment during his incarceration period and, therefore, the statute was unconstitutional. The court held that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in determining that appellant was a sexually violent predator based on the experts' testimony and reports and the finding that appellant in fact suffered from personality disorders that made him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence. The court found that the trial judge properly found clear and convincing evidence that appellant was a risk to reoffend unless he was confined. The court found no merit to appellant's ex post facto claim based on his failure to receive any treatment while incarcerated since he was found ineligible for treatment at the time of sentencing and, subsequently, he never made any attempt to utilize his statutory right to mental health services under the Department of Corrections regulations during his time of incarceration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sought review of defendant township's assessed value of its commercial property. In conformity with L. 1979, c. 91, N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:4-34, the Tax Court of New Jersey dismissed the action. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the taxpayer did not respond to the township's request for information on income derived from its property, the tax assessor valued the property using the information available to him. To show it was overtaxed, the taxpayer did not challenge the assessor's methodology but submitted to the tax court a valuation based on income it derived from leasing its property. The tax court held that under &sect; 54:4-34, the taxpayer forfeited its right to appeal the assessment by failing to respond to the request for information within 45 days. The taxpayer contended that its tax bill was a fine, forfeiture, or penalty imposed in violation of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VIII, and N.J. Const. article I, para. 12. The appellate court concluded that the tax court properly rejected this claim. The appeal-dismissal sanction of &sect; 54:4-34 was not punishment because it was rationally related to the need to efficiently assess and collect property taxes based on property value; therefore, it did not implicate the Excessive Fines Clause. Further, the taxpayer had the right to challenge the assessor's methodology at a reasonableness hearing, but failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a commercial tenant, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County, which dismissed its complaint against defendants, a city, its council, and its planning board. Plaintiff filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs seeking to invalidate a city council resolution that designated an area blighted under the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law (LRHL), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 40A:12A-1 to -49.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff operated a document storage and retrieval business in a six-story, 350,000 square foot building. The planning board recommended that all of the properties in a certain area, which included the building plaintiff rented, be designated blighted. The owner of the building, plaintiff's landlord, along with the other owners involved, were properly notified and defendant complied with all of the notice provisions of the LRHL. A hearing was held, with no one objecting to or commenting on the plan. Subsequently, the city council passed both an ordinance adopting the plan and a resolution. Plaintiff asserted that because it did not receive personal notice of the planning board's hearing on the blight resolution, it was unfairly deprived of the opportunity, and its right, to object to the recommended blight designation. The court held that the New Jersey Legislature did not intend to afford commercial tenants the right to individual notice with regard to a blight designation under the LRHL.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) entered into a settlement agreement that authorized respondent homeowner to tear down and reconstruct his oceanfront home without a permit otherwise required under the New Jersey Coastal Area Facility Review Act (CAFRA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 13:19-1 to -21, and the DEP's Coastal High Hazard Areas Rule, N.J.A.C. 7:7E-3.18. Appellant neighbors sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowner proposed to expand the size and footprint of his home. At issue was whether an administrative agency, through its dispute resolution process, could effectively override statutory, as well as its own regulatory requirements. Here, after initially denying a CAFRA coastal general permit for the tear down and reconstruction of an oceanfront home nine feet closer to the ocean, the DEP, finding a &quot;litigation risk,&quot; settled the homeowner's challenge to the DEP's denial by issuing a letter of authorization &quot;in lieu of permit,&quot; approving the development subject to conditions designed to meet several of the environmental concerns underlying the regulation's development ban. On the neighbors' challenge to the DEP's authorization, the appellate court held that, given the express language of the exception to the regulatory development ban, which the homeowner clearly did not meet, the DEP did not correctly assess its &quot;litigation risk,&quot; and that, in any event, the DEP could not use its settlement process to circumvent CAFRA's substantive permitting requirements to allow regulated development in a coastal region governed exclusively by CAFRA and its implementing regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DEP's decision was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, parents and their son, sued defendants, a school district superintendent, an assistant principal, and a board of education. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Atlantic County, granted defendants summary judgment, rejecting plaintiffs' challenge to the constitutionality of N.J.S.A. &sect; 18A:11-8, which authorized boards of education to adopt school dress code policies. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board denied the parents' request that their son be allowed to opt out from the dress code policy based on their &quot;constitutional rights&quot;; this suit followed. Plaintiffs claimed that &sect; 18A:11-8 was facially unconstitutional because it did not require school boards to adopt an opt-out provision, and violated privacy and freedom of expression rights. The appellate court found &sect; 18A:11-8 constitutional on its face and as applied to the parents' son, a student in a public school district which had adopted a school dress code policy five years before the suit was filed. Section 18A:11-8 was rationally related to the State's legitimate interests in protecting and preserving the quality of its educational system. As there was no fundamental right to be exempt from a school dress code policy, &sect; 18A:11-8's absence of a mandatory opt-out policy was constitutional. Dressing as one liked was not expressive conduct protected under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. Section 18A:11-8 was neither overbroad nor vague. The record showed that the board complied with the requirements of &sect; 18A:11-8(a) in adopting the dress code policy; plaintiffs presented no evidence to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer challenged the final decision of the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, which determined that the employer did not qualify as a trucking industry employer and, consequently, was not exempt from paying certain employees overtime at the statutory rate, pursuant to the New Jersey Wage and Hour Law, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 34:11-56a to -56a38.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from an employee complaint that the employer was not paying its delivery employees the statutory overtime rate. The Commissioner held that the employer did not qualify as a trucking industry employer under the exemption set forth in N.J.S.A. &sect; 34:11-56a4, allowing such employers to pay certain employees an overtime rate of not less than 1&frac12; times the minimum wage, rather than the statutorily required overtime rate of 1&frac12; times the employee's regular wage. The employer asserted that although it was in the retail industry, its facilities for delivery operations qualified as a trucking industry employer, as that term was defined under &sect; 34:11-56a4 as any business or establishment primarily operating for the purpose of conveying property from one place to another. The court upheld the decision of the Commissioner, concluding that the employer's facilities in which it conducted its trucking operations were not separate establishments so as to qualify for the trucking industry employer exemption. As a result, the employer was required to pay all employees 1&frac12; times the employee's regular hourly wage for each hour the employee worked in excess of 40 in any week.</SPAN></P>

The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a Commission detective, told a superior about a rat-infested dirt pile on Commission property near the employee's office building. Unsatisfied with the Commission's response, he contacted the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New Jersey Environmental Protection Agency. Since no regulatory action was taken, he contacted a television reporter, which led to the disciplinary proceedings. On appeal, he argued that his rights under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, had been violated. The appellate court held that the Commission's media relations policy, which prohibited employees from contacting the media without prior approval of the Commission's Executive Director, was overbroad and thus an unconstitutional prior restraint upon speech. It also held the that the policy had been unconstitutionally applied to the employee, who was disciplined for contacting the media to report a potentially toxic pile of dirt that had remained on the Commission's property for three years and the presence of dead rats in and around the dirt pile. He spoke to the reporter not only as an employee but also as a citizen on a matter of public concern.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a captain in a township's former fire district, sued defendants, township officials and the township division of fire, seeking reinstatement and alleging denial of due process and violations of N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 40A:14-19, -25. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, denied defendants' motion to dismiss, ordered reinstatement of plaintiff with back pay, but denied his request for counsel fees. Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township council adopted a resolution authorizing the dissolution of the fire district and applied to the local finance board of the department of county affairs, pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 40A:5A-20, to create the division of fire within the department of public safety. The township notified all fire district employees that they had to apply for employment with the township to serve in the division. Plaintiff filed a timely application, but was not offered employment. The appellate court held that plaintiff's right of review did not accrue when he received a letter notifying him that his employment would cease, but on the first day that he did not have a job. Therefore, his action in lieu of prerogative writs was filed within R. 4:69-6(a)'s 45-day time-limit. N.J.S.A. &sect; 40A:14-19 gave firefighters a constitutionally protected property interest in their tenure and conferred a reasonable expectation of continued employment unless just cause was established for termination. The creation of the division of fire to replace the previously existing fire district did not eliminate fire district firefighters' statutory tenure protections under &sect;&sect; 40A:14-19 and 40A:14-25.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he served the maximum term of a sentence imposed for kidnapping  and other crimes, appellant inmate was civilly committed to a Special Treatment Unit (STU) as a sexually violent predator, as defined by N.J.S.A. &sect; 30:4-27.26.  Respondent New Jersey Department of Corrections (DOC) denied his request for &quot;marital privacy&quot; and conjugal visitation. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that N.J.S.A. &sect; 30:4-27.34(d) of New Jersey's Sexually Violent Predator Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 30:4-27.24 to -27.38, required the DOC to adopt less restrictive regulations than those for prisons. He also argued that he was being denied his protected liberty interest in marital privacy and conjugal visitation. The appellate court that a sexually violent predator who was civilly committed to an STU had no constitutional right to marital privacy and conjugal visitation, and that DOC regulations that did not establish such a right were properly promulgated and in accord with legislative intent. Both the New Jersey Department of Human Services and the DOC participated in establishing N.J.A.C. 10:36A-1.1 to -4.6 and engaged in the appropriate rulemaking process. The regulations' prohibition of conjugal visits was not unreasonable, as it protected visitors from persons found likely to commit acts of sexual violence. His liberty interest in conjugal relations was outweighed by the State's interest in security and rehabilitation. As the State had a rational basis for treating repetitive-compulsive sex offenders differently than others, his equal protection claim failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff chiropractic group filed a demand for arbitration of its claim against defendant insurer for personal injury protection (PIP) costs incurred by a patient. Pursuant to N.J.S.A &sect; 2A:23A-13(a), plaintiff filed suit to vacate the arbitrator's decision. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Bergen County, affirmed the arbitration award. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was an assignee of the insurance contract. The insurer denied plaintiff's pre-certification requests for payment for the treatments it had provided to the patient. The insurer's policy allowed, but did not require, plaintiff to arbitrate its PIP claims. The arbitrator found that the insurer's reasons for the pre-certification denials were sufficient, denied plaintiff most of the payments it sought, and awarded the insurer costs and counsel fees. On appeal, plaintiff challenged N.J.S.A. &sect; 2A:23A-18(b) of the New Jersey Alternative Procedure for Dispute Resolution Act (APDRA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 2A:23A-1 to -19, which barred appellate review, arguing that &sect; 2A:23A-18(b) was unconstitutional as applied. The appellate court held that the statutory bar to appellate review was not unconstitutional as applied because the applicable insurance contract did not require the insured to file any claims it had in arbitration. The fact that plaintiff opted to arbitrate instead of sue amounted to a voluntary waiver of the right to appellate review. Plaintiff's claims did not involve a matter of public policy that warranted review under the appellate court's special supervisory function.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developer appealed the orders of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Civil Part, Monmouth County, which declared that defendants, a township planning board and the township committee, properly approved two ordinances, determined that the township mayor was not precluded from voting on them, and that a third permit application was subject to one of the ordinances. Defendants cross-appealed the dismissal of three complaints.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had been embroiled in litigation for a decade with regard to plaintiff's development, which involved the filing of various complaints and prerogative writ actions on plaintiff's part with regard to defendants' attempts to stop the development. The appeal at issue concerned the events occurring after the denial of plaintiff's first and amended second as-of-right applications for a development permit. The main issue addressed by the court was the propriety of the township mayor's voting on the enactment of the ordinances at issue since she owned a title company that had done work for plaintiff over the years. The court concluded that a direct financial involvement existed on the part of the township mayor under the Local Government Ethics Law, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 40A:9- 22.1 to -22.25, which required her disqualification from voting on the ordinances and the master plan. The court noted that the termination of the involvement in 2000 was not so remote in time that she was permitted to participate in the municipal actions in 2001 and 2004 involving the ordinances and the master plan to have freed her of any conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders, in part, and remanded the case to the trial court for entry of judgments in two related cases invalidating the 2004 Master Plan and, in another case, invalidating the 2004 ordinance.</SPAN></P>

He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a volunteer firefighter, admitted to making false fire alarms on three occasions. He argued that his convictions for misconduct and pattern of misconduct had to be reversed because as a matter of law, his conduct was not related to his office and he did not derive a benefit from his conduct. The appellate court held that when a volunteer firefighter called in a false alarm it was misconduct related to a public office or position, and  defendant received a &quot;benefit&quot; by the joy or gratification of participating in the response or even by giving the unit work to keep it in existence. Although he was unpaid, he was a &quot;public servant&quot; under &sect; 2C:30-2,  Thus, a volunteer fireman who called in false alarms and responded to the scene of the reported fires could be convicted of official misconduct under &sect; 2C:30-2. However, his conviction for setting false fire alarms, &sect; 2C:33-3, merged into official misconduct because the false alarm constituted the official misconduct. There was no insufficiency with the proofs as defendant was identified as the caller, independent of his statement or admission, and the reasonable inferences warranted a finding that he received a &quot;benefit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court ordered merger of the false alarm convictions with the official misconduct conviction and remanded for the correction of judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a civil liberties organization, challenged the final agency decision of defendant, the Department of Law and Public Safety, Office of the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey, which upheld a Directive issued by defendant, the Attorney General of the State of New Jersey, with respect to exit polling activities on election days. The organization brought suit asserting various objections to the Directive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Directive, issued to County Boards of Election and County Superintendents of Election, set forth various guidelines to adhere to with regard to exit polling. The organization specifically challenged the Directive's prohibition against distribution of voters' rights cards within 100 feet of the polls. The organization asserted that the Directive was not statutorily authorized and, even if it was, it was not adopted in compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 52:14B-1 to -25. The court upheld the Directive as a formal position of the Attorney General that was consistent with conduct allowed at exit polling. The court found that the Directive was an effort to improve procedures and was an attempt to provide greater access to entities such as the organization. The court rejected the organization's challenges regarding the failure of the Directive to comply with the APA since it did not constitute improper rule-making.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the organization's application to invalidate those portions of the Directive that barred the distribution of voters' rights cards within 100 feet of the entrance to a polling place and which required notification to an election board two weeks in advance of an election of those sites at which a non-partisan public interest group intended to conduct exit polling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Family Part, Somerset County, adjudicated appellant juvenile delinquent of offenses that would have constituted the following crimes if committed by an adult: third-degree resisting arrest (N.J.S.A.&sect; 2C:29-2(a)), fourth-degree aggravated assault (N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:12-1(b)(5)(a)), and the petty disorderly persons offense of defiant trespass (N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:18-3(b)). Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested for trespassing on public housing property, despite being notified that he was on a list prohibiting him from being on the housing complex property. Following his adjudication as a delinquent, appellant argued his inclusion on the list was unconstitutional as applied to him. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's finding of delinquency and found no constitutional infirmity as applied to him. Appellant did not contest the adjudication of delinquency for possession of a weapon that led to his being placed on the list, and made no effort to remove his name from the list. The appellate court did, however, caution public entities who maintained such lists to consider adopting regulations regarding one's placement on and removal from the list and establishing a procedure whereby one could challenge placement on the list. An officer's testimony that when he told appellant he was going to arrest him, appellant pulled back and struck the officer in the chest with his elbow; and that appellant refused to be handcuffed during a lawful arrest, was sufficient evidence to support appellant's adjudication for the resisting arrest and aggravated assault charges.</SPAN></P>

The issue was the authority of a municipality to require developers to set aside land for common open space or recreation, or make payments in lieu of those set-asides, as a condition of a development application. The Jackson Township trial court determined that the municipality's authority to make these exactions was limited to planned developments as defined in the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 40:55D-1 to -163. The Egg Harbor Township trial court concluded that the exactions were justified in other than planned developments.

The zoning officer denied plaintiff's application for a zoning permit, because it would violate the building line ordinance as well as a setback portion of the zoning ordinance.

The court found no impropriety with regard to the denial of the zoning permit since plaintiff was told from the beginning that his proposed pool project violated the building line ordinance. The court further found no due process violation and that CAFRA did not preempt the building line ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was granted leave to appeal the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County, which determined that defendant was only eligible for a maximum sentence of life imprisonment with 30 years of parole ineligibility, the maximum authorized sentence at the time of his offense. The State had moved to sentence defendant under the new law, codified at N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:11-3(b)(4), to life imprisonment without parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder, which was committed in 1994. On August 22, 2000, six years after the offense occurred, and six months before the penalty phase proceedings in defendant's trial, the New Jersey Legislature amended &sect; 2C:11-3 to permit a life sentence without parole in certain capital cases. Defendant endeavored to waive his rights under the ex post facto clause and asked that the new life-without-parole alternative be applied to him so that he could argue its application before the jury at the penalty phase. The trial court rejected the request and ruled that defendant could not waive an ex post facto objection to the new law. The court agreed and held that defendant was not subject to be sentenced to life-without-parole because, at the time of offense, the maximum parole ineligibility term was 30 years and under the December 17, 2007, amendments to the murder statute defendant was no longer able to present mitigating factors to reduce the sentence to such term if not outweighed by aggravating factors. The court noted that its holding was narrow in its application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order and remanded the case to the trial court for sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's motion for leave to appeal from the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Burlington County, which granted defendants'  motion to suppress. Defendants were indicted on various drug-related charges as a result of 1,400 pounds of marijuana being found in the truck-trailer they were operating.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' truck was stopped for an administrative search of the commercial vehicle, pursuant to federal and state law. The trooper conducting the search noticed the nervousness of one defendant and several irregularities existing with the trailer. After making those observations, the troopers arrested defendants. Thereafter, defendants' tractor-trailer was towed, and the troopers gained access to the secret compartment containing the marijuana. The trial court concluded that the safety inspection of defendants' truck was transformed into a search for evidence of a crime when the trooper discovered what appeared to be a hidden compartment at the front of the trailer, and therefore, the troopers should have obtained a warrant before taking steps to confirm the existence of the compartment and its contents. On appeal, the State argued that the troopers' search of the hidden compartment did not exceed the scope of the regulatory inspection of defendants' trailer. The court agreed and held that the warrantless search of the trailer, including the search of the hidden compartment, was during the course of a routine safety inspection and constituted a valid administrative search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order suppressing the evidence obtained in that search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant joint planning board and zoning board of adjustment declined to act on plaintiff developer's variance application. The developer filed an action in lieu of prerogative writs against the board and defendant borough, alleging various constitutional and statutory claims. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hunterdon County, dismissed the complaint without prejudice. The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borough designated a defunct paper mill as an area in need of redevelopment under the New Jersey Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 40A:12A-1 to -49. The borough adopted a redevelopment plan for the site, calling for both commercial and residential uses and large areas set aside for open space and wetlands. The plan required a party seeking to develop the site to obtain from the borough council a determination of consistency with the plan before submitting its proposal to the board. The developer wished to develop the site with much higher densities and more expansive uses than allowed by the plan. If the variances were granted, the area's permitted residential density would vastly increase. The appellate court noted that pursuant to the plan, the developer had to obtain from the borough council a determination of consistency with the plan as a precondition of having its development project considered by the board. Its proposal was not a &quot;minor exception&quot; to the plan, but rather an attempt to rezone, de facto, the entire redevelopment area. Further, the challenge to the merits of the plan, filed over two years after its adoption, was untimely under R. 4:69-6(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. However, the dismissal was without prejudice to future proceedings, including a potential inverse condemnation action if the existing plan ultimately deprived the developer, or the title owner, of all economically beneficial uses of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and fined in the municipal court for violating a town's noise ordinance. He appealed. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Warren County, reversed on the ground that the noise ordinance was preempted by a state statute and administrative regulations to the extent that it regulated noise emanating from a commercial entity. The town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant operated a roller skating rink; a neighbor, who lived 100 feet from the rink, complained that the music was too loud. The town's ordinance prohibited the making of loud, unnecessary noises likely to disturb others. The operation of a machine that was clearly audible 100 feet from the building in which it was located was prima facie evidence of a violation. Defendant failed to present evidence in the municipal court or in the intermediate appellate court indicating that the ordinance was not more stringent than the pertinent state regulation, N.J.A.C. 7:29-1.2(a), or that the ordinance had not been approved by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. The instant court held that based on defendant's failure to meet his burden of proving facts that would establish that the town's noise ordinance was preempted by the New Jersey Noise Control Act of 1971, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 13:1G-1 to -23, the ordinance was valid. However, local noise ordinances could require DEP approval to be enforceable at least with respect to certain facilities, such as commercial and industrial sites.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was reversed and the conviction was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a teacher and her husband, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hudson County, which granted summary judgment dismissing all of their claims against defendants, a board of education, a supervising teacher, a principal, a superintendent, a medical center, and a mobile crisis unit. Plaintiffs asserted claims of false imprisonment, assault, and other torts arising from her employment termination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cause of action arose from the teacher making a comment to the supervising teacher that she was under a lot of stress, and the supervising teacher accused her of threatening to kill students and faculty. The teacher was detained for several hours and transported against her will to a crisis center where she was discharged later that same day. The trial court dismissed all of plaintiffs' claims upon concluding that they were barred by qualified immunity. The court found that the trial court erred in finding that the supervising teacher and the principal were immune from liability for any of the intentional tort claims asserted and the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim since both of those individuals participated in the detention of the teacher. The court held that the medical center and the mobile crisis unit were not public entities and did not enjoy the immunities of the Tort Claims Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 59:1-1 to 12-3. The school board was properly found to be immune on the intentional tort claims since it had no liability for the willful misconduct of its employees but the breach of contract claim against it should not have been dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, in part, the dismissal of all claims against the superintendent and the dismissal of all of the intentional tort claims asserted against the school board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant gambler challenged the decision of respondent, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, which denied his petition for removal from the voluntary lifetime self-exclusion list (SEL). Following a series of letters and phone calls, the gambler filed his formal petition with the Commission seeking an order removing him from the SEL. The SEL was part of the New Jersey Casino Control Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 5:12-1 to 210.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The gambler had placed himself on the SEL. The gambler acknowledged that he voluntarily requested his placement on the SEL and understood that he would be under a lifetime ban from New Jersey casinos. The gambler sought removal from the SEL upon becoming aware that some out-of-state casinos affiliated with those in New Jersey would also exclude him from their gaming facilities. The Commission denied the application, concluding that the potential extra-territorial consequences of placement on New Jersey's SEL were collateral and do not negate the applicant's voluntary actions and that the harm was minimal when balanced against the statutory aims of the SEL. The Commission also determined that its revision of its form to include reference to that potential consequence after being informed of it by the gambler did not demonstrate an acknowledgement of a duty to disclose that information or the insufficiency of the prior form signed by him. The court found no discernible basis to second-guess the agency's decision and upheld the same and deferred to the Commission's expertise and experience in assessing the gambler's unique circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured's policy application stated he was single, and the only operator of the insured vehicle; in fact, he was married and his wife drove the vehicle. The insured, his wife, and child were injured in two separate accidents; the insurer refused coverage based on the insured's misrepresentations, and the matter was submitted to arbitration. Exercising its limited supervisory jurisdiction to review a trial judge's review of an arbitration award rendered under the New Jersey Alternative Procedure for Dispute Resolution Act (ADPRA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 2A:23A-1 to -30, the appellate court concluded that the trial judge acted within his statutory jurisdiction in finding the arbitrator's failure to consolidate two related arbitrations, which resulted in inconsistent awards, constituted &quot;prejudicial error&quot; as defined by N.J.S.A. &sect; 2A:23A-13(c)(5), thus permitting the trial judge's intervention. And, since the trial judge acted within his jurisdiction, the appellate court was precluded by N.J.S.A. &sect; 2A:23A-18(b), which declared that &quot;there shall be no further appeal or review&quot; of a trial court's review of an ADPRA award, from examining the correctness of the trial judge's determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The chiropractor's appeal of the order that reversed the arbitration award was dismissed pursuant to &sect; 2A:23A-18(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, eight rural and poor school districts, challenged the final decision of respondent, the New Jersey State Board of Education, which initiated a process to systematically remedy the deficiencies that were found to have existed by the implementation of a school funding statute, the Comprehensive Educational Improvement and Financing Act of 1996, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 18A:7F-1 to -42. The suit was initiated via a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board found that appellants' circumstances mirrored those of urban school districts receiving remedial relief in accordance with a series of New Jersey Supreme Court decisions, yet declined to require the same relief for appellants. The Board instead directed its Commissioner to design and conduct a needs assessment of each appellant, which the Commissioner failed to do, opting to await the fate of pending legislative proposals, which had since been enacted into law. The court, in recognizing the judiciary's stated preference for legislative and executive solutions to remedy constitutional violations, found no warrant to interfere with the approach ordered by the Board. The court also found no inconsistency in ordering the Commissioner to promptly proceed with a particularized needs assessment of appellants as a integral step in the Board's ultimate determination, on remand. The court noted that in making such an assessment, the Commissioner must determine whether the new funding formula, set forth in the School Funding Reform Act of 2008, L. 2007, c. 260, would afford appellants' students the thorough and efficient education to which they were constitutionally entitled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings, including the necessity of conducting a needs assessment of appellants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated cases, appellant landowner challenged the orders of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hudson County, which upheld the condemnation of his property by appellees, a town and its redevelopment agency, and that dismissed his counterclaim and third-party complaint. The property owner's claims were dismissed as untimely, pursuant to the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law (LRHL), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 40A:12A-1 to -49.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were also two consolidated companion cases involved, for a total of four cases before the court. The property owner contested the blight designation of his property under the LRHL. The trial court ruled that the property owner's defense was time-barred, because he had not filed a timely action in lieu of prerogative writs under R. 4:69-6 after the town designated his property for redevelopment. Although the property owner had received notice by mail of the town's preliminary investigation of the proposed blight designation under N.J.S.A. &sect; 40A:12A-6 of the LRHL, he and others in the proposed redevelopment zone were not individually notified when the town approved that designation. The court held that several deficiencies existed under &sect; 40A:12A-6, but upheld its constitutionality. The court set forth three mandates necessary in providing notice to a property owner to satisfy due process. The court noted that the trial court failed to consider N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, para. 1, the Eminent Domain Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 20:3-1 to -50, and other applicable court rules in making its decision.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County, ordered the township to issue lessee the required permits. The parties then settled. Later, the lessee moved to enforce the consent judgment, and the township moved for relief from it under R. 4:50-1. The trial court granted the lessee's motion; the township appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:34-7 barred sexually-oriented businesses in some locations, but could be constitutionally applied only if they were allowed elsewhere in the relevant market area. After the trial court ruled the ordinance banning such businesses anywhere in the township was facially unconstitutional, the parties entered into a settlement allowing the lessee to operate its business, but requiring it to apply for a nonconformity permit if the ordinance was amended to allow such businesses in other zones. The township enacted such an ordinance, and denied the lessee's permit application. The appellate court held that a governmental body had authority to enter into a settlement of a case challenging the constitutionality of a statute under which it agreed to an injunction against enforcement of the statute if it reasonably concluded there was a substantial question concerning the statute's constitutionality and the costs of the statute's defense were not justifiable. The governmental body could seek to vacate or modify the judgment memorializing such a settlement where it could show that enforcement of the judgment would no longer be equitable due to changes in the law or facts.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor's motion to waive the charges to the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Monmouth County, from the Family Part, was granted under the 2000 amendment to N.J.S.A. &sect; 2A:4A-26, L. 1999, c. 373, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also had a severe drug dependency problem. The Family Part concluded that defendant's psychological impairments were not encompassed by the Attorney General's Guidelines for determining whether a Chart 1 charge against a juvenile over the age of 16 should be waived to the Law Division and that the prosecutor's decision to waive the charges against him did not constitute a patent and gross abuse of discretion. The court agreed and held that the Family Part was not required to consider the juvenile's alleged psychological impairments as they were not included in the factors that the guidelines required a prosecutor to consider. The court noted that defendant could not prevent the waiver of the charge to the adult court under the amendment to &sect; 2A:4A-26(e).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, four individuals and an organization, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hudson County, which dismissed their suit against defendants, a city, its mayor, and three of its councilmen. By their cause of action, plaintiffs challenged the asserted lack of enforcement of an ordinance adopted by the city designed to curtail awarding municipal contracts to political contributors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance at issue restricted certain political contributors from negotiating or entering into certain contracts with the city. The trial court dismissed the action upon determining that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the asserted lack of enforcement of the ordinance. The court found error, concluding that plaintiffs had a sufficient particularized interest in the enforcement of the ordinance, beyond their status as mere taxpayers, to afford them standing to pursue the lawsuit. By seeking to compel defendants to enforce the anti-pay-to-play ordinance enacted as a result of an initiative effort in which all plaintiffs were heavily involved, the court determined that the individual plaintiffs had that slight additional private interest coupled with the great public interest in seeking the enforcement of the ordinance to establish standing. The court also determined that plaintiffs did not need to demonstrate any additional special damages. Further, because the four individual plaintiffs had standing, the organizational plaintiff had standing as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), and intervenor, a town redevelopment authority, challenged the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Mercer County, which denied DEP's motion to dismiss appellee remediator's complaint and granted the remediator's motion for summary judgment. The remediator initiated the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case actually represented a three year battle between the parties with regard to the DEP and the authority attempting to remove the remediator as the remediating party for the contaminated site at issue, without declaring it in default of its cleanup obligations.

The authority had obtained title to the property through eminent domain. The court held that the trial court properly had jurisdiction over the complaint and that it was properly framed as one seeking declaratory relief as an actual dispute existed between the parties. The court agreed with the trial court that &sect; 58:10B-3.1 did not authorize the DEP to remove the remediator as the remediating party for the property since no oversight document was executed but disagreed with the trial court's interpretation and application of the phrase without limitation set forth in N.J.A.C. 7:26C-1.3 and the term oversight document set forth in N.J.S.A. &sect;&nbsp;58:10B-3.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for failure to appear in court without lawful excuse, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;2C:29-7. He moved to dismiss the indictment on grounds &sect; 2C:29-7 was unconstitutional. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Ocean County, granted the motion. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 2C:29-7 was unconstitutional because it shifted the burden of proving the &quot;without lawful excuse&quot; and &quot;knowing&quot; mental culpability elements of the offense to the defendant. The appellate court noted that as &sect; 2C:29-7 did not describe the requisite mens rea, under the &quot;gap filler&quot; provision of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:2-2(c)(3), the State had to show that defendant's failure to appear was &quot;knowing.&quot; N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:29-7 was constitutional. Although a jury instruction in the language of the second sentence of &sect; 2C:29-7 would impose an unconstitutional burden upon defendant to disprove the &quot;knowing&quot; mental culpability element of the offense, this constitutional defect could be avoided by a jury instruction that omitted any reference to defendant's having the burden to prove that his failure to appear was &quot;not knowingly.&quot; Section 2C:29-7 was not unconstitutionally vague. A criminal defendant who had been directed to appear at a specified time and place was prohibited from failing to appear at that time and place. No person of ordinary intelligence would have any difficulty knowing what was prohibited by &sect; 2C:29-7, so that he or she could act accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County, which convicted defendant for first-degree aggravated sexual assault on a child. Defendant was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment with a nine-year parole bar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted based on the uncorroborated testimony of a child witness who had recanted her accusation and then withdrew the recantation. Prior to his arrest, defendant entered into a polygraph stipulation without advice of counsel. He failed the test, and the test result was admitted at his trial. The court determined that defendant's conviction required reversal because inducing an uncounseled defendant to sign a stipulation agreeing that polygraph results will be admissible at trial, violated an accused's Sixth Amendment right to trial counsel. In so holding, the court determined that State v. Reyes, 237 N.J. Super. 250, 567 A.2d 287 (App. Div. 1989) was no longer good law. The court further found that the trial court should have held a N.J.R.E. 104 hearing before barring defendant from introducing evidence that a few months after accusing him, the victim-witness accused another man of molesting her and then recanted her accusation. Because the polygraph evidence may well have made the difference between conviction and acquittal in the case, the court held that the conviction required reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case to the trial court for retrial. The court directed that, prior to retrial, the trial judge must conduct further proceedings to determine whether defendant was entitled to question witnesses about a subsequent incident in which the victim-witness accused another man of molesting her and then recanted that accusation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">On appeal from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County, Indictment No. 03-10-1325-I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County, which convicted her, following a jury trial, for second-degree conspiracy to commit both second-degree robbery and first-degree bias intimidation based on the victim's handicap, in violation of N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:5-2.  Defendant also appealed from the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from her attempt to collect back rent from the victim. The victim worked at a grocery store as a cart retriever and the evidence established that defendant and her two cohorts had visited the grocery store and attempted to retrieve money from the victim. In instructing the jury, the trial judge charged that to prove bias intimidation, the State had to prove that defendant committed the underlying crime of robbery and that she committed the crime with the purpose to intimidate the victim because of his handicap. The court held that the trial court erred in the jury instruction by not properly defining the term handicap because the trial court's instruction in no way connected the victim's disadvantage to his physical or mental disability as the victim could have been disadvantaged because he was outnumbered two to one by large assailants. In failing to properly define the term handicap, the trial court, in effect, relieved the State of its burden of proving a key element of the case. Since the verdict sheet required a separate verdict on the conspiracy to commit robbery charge, that conviction was sustained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, in part, the aspect of the conspiracy conviction that was based on bias intimidation as a predicate offense and vacated the associated seven-year sentence. The court affirmed, in part, defendant's conviction for second-degree conspiracy to commit second-degree robbery and affirmed the imposition of the sentence for that conviction. The case was remanded to the trial court for correction of the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction in municipal court, defendant had a trial de novo in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County. He was again convicted of violating Lawrence, N.J., Municipal Ordinance &sect; 535(L)(2), which banned the display of balloon signs. He appealed, contending the ordinance was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151-69, and was otherwise invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a senior union official. As part of a labor action, he authorized the union to display a balloon in the shape of a rat, as a symbol of protest against unfair labor practices. There was evidence that a rat was a well-known symbol of a labor dispute and a signal to third parties that there was an invisible picket line they should not cross. The focus of the appeal was the enforceability of the ordinance, which prevented the display of certain signs, including balloon signs. The appellate court rejected defendant's contention that an inflatable rat was not prohibited by the ordinance; &quot;balloon signs or other inflated signs&quot; designed to attract the attention of pedestrians and motorists were expressly banned. The ordinance, which did not affect the parties' rights in the labor dispute, was not preempted by the NLRA, nor did it abridge any party's freedom of expression. The ordinance's exemption for balloon signs for business grand openings did not violate the First Amendment. The ordinance was not void for vagueness. It was content-neutral and the record did not support a claim that it was selectively enforced against labor unions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 suit against defendants, the New Jersey Department of Corrections (DOC) and its Commissioner, alleging they imposed a substantial burden on his religious exercise, in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc-1 of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA). The New Jersey Superior Court, Law Division, Middlesex County, granted defendants summary judgment; the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate became a member of a group -- which he claimed was a religious group -- that was perceived by DOC officials to be a security threat, and he was disciplined administratively for possessing the group's materials. The trial court, in granting defendants summary judgment, made no mention of RLUIPA but relied solely case law addressing claims of First Amendment violations. The appellate court held that the inmate had standing to file the suit, as he suffered detention, loss of commutation time, and confiscation of items under the policy he challenged. The trial court erred by limiting its analysis to Turner v. Safley First Amendment standards; the inmate was entitled to a summary judgment evaluation by the separate standards of RLUIPA. The appellate court did not reject the DOC's contention that prison security was a compelling state interest. But in order to apply RLUIPA standards, a determination had to be made, not only that a compelling state interest was involved, but also as to whether the DOC's policies represented the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for a determination whether genuine issues of material fact existed in respect of the standards of RLUIPA, and for such proceedings as might be necessary to resolve those issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was transferred from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Civil Part, Burlington County. Defendant, the Bureau of Rooming and Boarding House Standards in the Division of Codes and Standards in the Department of Community Affairs, moved for a final remand and to supplement the record in the contested case involving plaintiffs, an individual tenant and a corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was transferred to the court due to jurisdictional considerations. The court found that the issues between the parties dated back to 2001, when they entered a settlement agreement in respect of alleged violations of the Rooming and Boarding House Act of 1979, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;55:13B-1 to -21, regarding property in which the individual plaintiff resided. The Bureau, based on an investigation, determined that the property was being used as a boarding house and that plaintiffs were violating N.J.S.A. &sect;&nbsp;55:13B-7. When plaintiffs resisted the citation, the case was transmitted to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) as a contested case. Plaintiffs raised a series of constitutional questions, and the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) determined that it had no jurisdiction to hear and decide the constitutional issues raised by plaintiffs. The court disagreed and held that it was unable to consider the constitutional issues without a well-developed record isolating the essential factual issues. The court clarified that constitutional questions necessary to complete resolution of a contested case may be considered in an administrative proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the Bureau for re-transmittal to the OAL for a contested-case hearing and initial decision on all issues and for reference, in turn, to the Bureau head for a final decision. The court dismissed the Bureau's pending motion to supplement the record, without prejudice, subject to such determinations as the ALJ made in the conduct of the hearing regarding the record and the receipt of evidence and argument.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the reporting requirements of &sect;&nbsp;2C:11-5.1 forced a driver involved in an accident that resulted in serious injury or a fatality to either abide by the statute and report his involvement, facing prosecution under other laws; or he could exercise his Fifth Amendment right to silence, facing prosecution under &sect;&nbsp;2C:11-5.1 and potentially other laws as well. The court disagreed and held that compliance with the reporting requirements would preclude prosecution under &sect; 2C:11-5.1 and that compliance with those requirements would not violate a driver's privilege against self-incrimination as disclosure of one's name and address was essentially a neutral act and most accidents occurred without creating criminal liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court denying defendant's motion to have the statute declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The property owner's suit challenged the constitutionality of the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 13:20-1 to -35, as it applied to its property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner had a 93 acre tract of undeveloped land located within the preservation area in the Highlands region. The property owner asserted that the Highlands Act was unconstitutional, as applied to its property, because it operated to bar its planned development as otherwise permitted by law and resulted in a taking of its property without compensation. Based on the alleged retroactive application of the Act to the property owner's subdivision approval, the complaint also asserted that the Act violated the equal protection and due process guarantees of the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. The court agreed with the trial court's determination that the property owner had yet to exhaust all of its administrative remedies before bringing suit. Specifically, the administrative hardship waiver remedy of the Act had to be exhausted before the property owner was entitled to assert a claim that the Act's restrictions upon development in the preservation area of the Highlands Region had resulted in a regulatory taking. The court also upheld the validity of the retroactive application of the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a final agency decision of respondent, the Department of Corrections, which upheld the following three regulations: N.J.A.C. 10A:18-9.6, N.J.A.C. 10A:16-4.4, and N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1. Appellant was incarcerated at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (ADTC) serving an aggregate sentence of life imprisonment with 25 years parole ineligibility for aggravated sexual assault and other crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged N.J.A.C. 10A:18-9.6, which allowed the ADTC administrator to prohibit ADTC inmates from receiving, possessing, distributing, or displaying not sexually oriented material that impeded the rehabilitation of inmates, as being unconstitutional because it restricted inmates' rights under common law and the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court held that the regulation was facially constitutional and was within the deference courts should give to the professional judgment of prison administrators obligated to further legitimate prison objectives dealing with rehabilitation. The court upheld the constitutionality of N.J.A.C. 10A:16-4.4, regulating exceptions to statutorily privileged inmate-therapist communications, as the regulation did not demonstrate deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners, as required to find an Eighth Amendment violation. The court summarily rejected appellant's challenge to N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1, since the Supreme Court of New Jersey recently upheld its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected appellant's challenges and held that all three regulations complied with the federal and New Jersey Constitutions. The court remanded the case to permit appellant to challenge the withholding of specific magazines, periodicals, and other material from him under the standards set forth in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a same-sex couple, challenged the final agency decision of the Acting Director of the New Jersey Department of the Treasury, Division of Taxation, which denied appellants' request to file a joint State of New Jersey tax return for their 2006 earnings. The couple were residents of New Jersey and were married in Canada on July 28, 2003.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the case really presented a timing issue, namely the transitional issue presented that was compelled by certain case law and the subsequent enactment of New Jersey's Civil Union Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;37:1-28 to -36, which permitted a same-sex couple, married in another jurisdiction before the statute's February 19, 2007, effective date, to file a joint New Jersey gross income tax return. The court held that appellants were entitled to declaratory relief concerning future tax years, which the Division did not oppose. However, the court held that the Division was not required to treat appellants' 2006 income as joint income. In contrast to appellants' assertion that they were entitled to full parity with married heterosexual couples on matters of taxation the moment that the case decision recognizing same-sex marriages and civil unions from other states and foreign jurisdictions was issued, the Division was entitled to a reasonable transition period to conform its forms and procedures to the equal protection constitutional and statutory principles espoused in the case law as to same-sex couples.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the Acting Director of the Division.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff construction company sued defendant township in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Camden County, contesting the township's designation of intervenor/defendant developer as master redeveloper for the township's redevelopment plan. The trial court dismissed the company's unconstitutional taking claim and its claim based on alleged political impropriety. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township determined that approximately 600 acres of waterfront property, including 137 acres owned by the company, were in need of redevelopment. The township designated a master redeveloper for the entire area. The company did not contest the township's determination that the area was in need of redevelopment or the township's redevelopment plan. The company said it should be permitted to develop its own property as part of the redevelopment project and not be subject to eminent domain proceedings to turn its property over to the master redeveloper. The appellate court held the company did not have a constitutional right to redevelop its own property, and, once it was determined that the property was in need of redevelopment, thus establishing a public purpose, the township had the authority under the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 40A:12A-1 to -73, to condemn the property and designate a master redeveloper to execute the redevelopment plan if the township reasonably concluded that such action was necessary or convenient. The record established a reasonable basis for the township's decision, and the court owed judicial deference to that legislative decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner intended to occupy the oceanfront home with her aged and ailing mother. The DEP concluded that the entirety of petitioner's property was a primary frontal dune and denied the permit. The court determined that it was called upon to interpret the regulations promulgated by the DEP that defined a dune under N.J.A.C. 7:7E-3.16(a) and a primary frontal dune under N.J.A.C. 7:7-7.8(d)(1)(ii). The court interpreted the regulatory definitions and concluded that petitioner's entire property was not a primary frontal dune as well as determined that the proposed construction area was not on a dune. As a result, the court held that petitioner's property was not subject to the regulatory restrictions the DEP used to deny the application. The court also concluded that the DEP's interpretation of the regulatory language resulted in a fundamental unfairness to petitioner, whose surrounding neighbors had constructed similar homes on their adjacent properties.</SPAN></P>

The committee was serving a state prison term of five years for tampering with a witness, in violation N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:28-5(a)(1), and an additional one year consecutive term for a probation violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committee asserted on appeal that he was wrongfully committed because none of his convictions were sexually violent offenses as defined by N.J.S.A. &sect; 30:4-27.26. The trial judge identified several convictions that established the committee as a sexually violent offender, including his last conviction for tampering with a witness. The trial judge underscored the circumstances involving that witness, which included the fact that the witness was an underage boy whom the committee had forced into bondage. The court upheld the commitment, concluding that &sect;&nbsp;30:4-27.26(b) was a catchall provision permitting the psychiatric experts and the trial court to consider the factual circumstances of the offenses in making the determination of whether sexually violent offenses were committed and whether the committee was a sexual predator under the SVPA. The court held that the use of force, coercion, threats of physical harm, lack of knowing consent, exploitation of underage victims, and grooming them with drugs or alcohol to satisfy his compulsive sexual gratification presented sufficient circumstances for the trial judge to have found the committee's offenses were sexually violent offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, parents of a deceased child, sued respondent county medical examiner and others, alleging he violated N.J.S.A. &sect; 10:6-2 of the New Jersey Civil Rights Act of 2004 (CRA). The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Camden County, dismissed the suit against the medical examiner on grounds the parents failed to file a notice against him under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act (TCA), N.J.S.A. &sect; 59:1-1 et seq. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The medical examiner performed an autopsy on the 13-year-old child and concluded that he died due to cardiac arrhythmia resulting from a congenital heart defect. The parents alleged he &quot;botched&quot; the autopsy to help a state trooper avoid liability for the child's death. They never filed a notice of claim against the medical examiner under the TRA. The appellate court held that the notice requirements of the TCA did not apply to a claim based on the CRA. The broad remedial purposes of the CRA were not the sort of claims to which the TCA was a legislative response. The TCA was not designed to vindicate societal interests or to rectify public or governmental misconduct or to protect any individual constitutional interest or civil right, all matters that were addressed by the CRA. The appellate court did not express any view on whether the parents' claim against the medical examiner came within the CRA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction entered by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Criminal Part, Sussex County, finding him guilty of speeding, in violation of N.J.S.A. &sect; 39:4-98. The municipal court judge fined defendant $ 400 and imposed $ 39 in court costs. Though defendant's license was originally suspended for 60 days, such suspension was vacated after a de novo review of the record by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from an officer observing defendant driving at a high rate of speed, specifically 66 miles per hour (m.p.h.) in a 40 m.p.h. zone. The officer testified that she lost sight of defendant's vehicle for 30 seconds. On appeal, defendant contended that the State failed to demonstrate what the lawful speed was along that portion of the road because the officer's testimony, which was the only evidence adduced on the issue, was legally insufficient to meet the State's burden. Defendant cited case law precedent to support his argument on appeal, but the court distinguished such case law as involving issues wherein no evidence of the applicable speed limit was offered. Contrary to defendant's assertion, the court held that the sworn testimony of the officer was admissible and was sufficient proof of the lawful speed limit in the area in question. The court noted that the State was not obligated to prove the applicable speed limit through the introduction of a certified copy of an ordinance or regulation. The court refused to address defendant's challenge to the suspension of his license since that issue was moot based on the suspension being vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two railroads, appealed the decision of the Tax Court (New Jersey), which affirmed the assessments imposed by defendant, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation, of the Railroad Franchise Tax (RFT), pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;54:29A-13 to -15. One railroad appealed the RFT assessments against it for tax years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, and the other challenged the assessments for tax years 2000, 2002, and 2003.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tax Court affirmed the assessments by granting the Director's motion for summary judgment. The tax was based on a calculation of each railroad's New Jersey-derived net operating income as a percentage of the net income the railroad derived operating world-wide. To compute the percentage of each railroad's net income attributable to its operations in New Jersey, the Director multiplied a fraction against each railroad's nationwide net income and then applied the statutory 10 percent tax rate to the railroad's income attributed to its New Jersey operations. On appeal, plaintiffs asserted that the Director's formula was facially unconstitutional and unconstitutional as applied to their operations and that genuine issues of material fact remained in dispute. The court held that the 10 percent RFT tax rate did not violate the 4-R Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11501, and that the Director's apportionment formula was not unconstitutional on its face. The court agreed that summary judgment in favor of the Director was inappropriate since plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to establish a genuine issue of fact as to whether the formula was unconstitutional as applied to their operations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, in part, the decision of the Tax Court upholding the constitutionality of the RFT. The court reversed, in part, the Tax Court decision affirming the tax assessments for the challenged tax years. The court remanded the case to the Tax Court for plaintiffs to have the opportunity to make a showing that the RFT was unconstitutional as applied to them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fair housing center sought invalidation of the master plan and zoning regulations adopted by the NJMC and wanted to ensure development of requisite affordable housing within its district. The builders association sought a judgment declaring that the NJMC and the Sports Authority had a constitutional obligation under the Mount Laurel Doctrine to provide low income housing opportunities. The builders association sought to have the regulations of both the NJMC and the Sports Authority declared unconstitutional. The court confirmed that under the New Jersey Constitution, as interpreted by the Mount Laurel cases, the NJMC was responsible for affirmative zoning and planning for affordable housing in its 21,000 acre district but that it had to act in consultation with the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH), with the NJMC's planning and zoning being based on municipal responsibilities for affordable housing as established by COAH. As such, the court held that the interim rules were held reasonable. The Sports Authority was held not to be responsible under the New Jersey Constitution for affordable housing within its portion of the Meadowlands District.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four cases were consolidated on appeal that raised a common question with regard to petitioner dependents' claims for death benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 34:15-1 to -142. In two cases, the dependents appealed and in the other two cases, respondent employers appealed the respective decision of the Division of Workers' Compensation, Department of Labor (New Jersey).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no dispute that each of the four dependents were eligible for death benefits as a result of the death of a worker. The common question in each case was whether the revised formula set forth in N.J.S.A. &sect; 34:15-13(a), as amended by L. 2003, c. 253, &sect;&sect; 1 and 4, should be applied to determine the amount of the benefit on a claim that arose prior to the effective date of the amendment. The two judges of compensation that decided the four cases answered that question differently. Under the revised formula, N.J.S.A. &sect; 34:15-13(a) was amended to provide a benefit based on 70 percent of wages for one or more dependents, as opposed to the prior amount of 50 percent of wages for one dependent. The court held that the revised formula applied in pending cases to calculate death benefits for dates on and after the effective date of the amendment, namely January 14, 2004. In making its decision, the court found that the legislative history suggested that the New Jersey Legislature intended to extend the enhanced benefit to the dependents of eligible workers who died before the effective date of the amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders entered by the judge of compensation with regard to the two petitions wherein the employers appealed. The court reversed the orders with regard to the petitions of the two appealing dependents and remanded those two cases to the Division for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

His obligation was to determine what ought to be, as opposed to whether the action or inaction of the board of freeholders was arbitrary or unreasonable. He did not exercise judicial power; rather, &sect; 2A:158-7 constituted him a legislative agent, and he exercised a delegated legislative function.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of fondling his seven-year-old piano student through her clothing. He asserted that as he suffered from Asperger's Disorder, a form of autism, he did not know it was inappropriate to have the child sit on his lap. He was precluded from offering expert evidence about this disorder as an explanation for some of his arguably inappropriate behavior with the child. The appellate court held that it was not necessary for this disorder to be a &quot;mental disease or defect&quot; under the diminished capacity statute,&nbsp;N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:4-2, for the evidence to be admissible; it was sufficient if it had probative value on an issue in the case. The prosecutor strongly argued that defendant's behavior constituted &quot;grooming&quot; as a prelude to a sexual assault. Hence, the error was not harmless. N.J. R. Evid. 803(c)(27), the so-called &quot;tender years&quot; exception to the hearsay rule, did not run afoul of Crawford v. Washington and its progeny, insofar as it permitted introduction of evidence of a &quot;testimonial&quot; out-of-court statement of the victim (her videotaped interview by an investigator), because the victim testified in court and was able to be fully cross-examined on her allegations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Cape May County, which granted summary judgment dismissal of their claims against defendant borough. Plaintiffs sought compensation for the physical taking of their property by the borough, together with damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' complaint concerned vacant oceanfront property that the parties stipulated was not capable of development, because it was situated directly between the borough's dune line established in 1968, and the ocean high-water line. The borough had previously rejected a proposed exchange of property by letter dated April 29, 2965, which was requested by plaintiffs' predecessors. The entire suit required a determination as to the applicable limitation period within which a private party must commence an action to challenge the taking of private property by a public entity, as an exercise of its police power, where the public entity's actions failed to comply with any of the statutory provisions governing the use of eminent domain and, therefore, presented an inverse condemnation matter. The court held that there was no question that the borough's actions in physically appropriating plaintiffs' property constituted a taking by inverse condemnation since no legal process was followed. The court also held that plaintiffs' cause of action accrued on or about April 26, 1965, and was, therefore, time-barred by the application of the six-year period set forth in N.J.S.A. &sect; 2A:14-1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sued defendants, a county and its director of public safety, alleging political discrimination. A jury returned a verdict in her favor, finding that her political affiliation was the reason she was not promoted. Ruling on her equitable claims, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County, granted a &quot;rightful place&quot; remedy but denied her request for instatement or front pay. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found that the employee was denied promotion to county superintendent of weights and measures solely due to her political affiliation, contrary to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The jury awarded compensatory damages and found that the employee was entitled to punitive damages. The parties reached a post-verdict settlement that resolved all issues except the official's claim for equitable relief, which they agreed to submit to the trial court. At the hearing, the trial court ordered that the employee receive salary and benefits comparable to what the incumbent superintendent was receiving at the time of the hearing. The appellate court concluded this &quot;rightful place&quot; remedy, which did not include front pay, failed to make the employee whole. As there was only one superintendent, instatement should have been viewed as a priority, even at the expense of the incumbent. The record did not support the trial court's findings that the incumbent was an &quot;innocent party&quot; who would be substantially harmed if demoted. Even assuming he was an &quot;innocent party,&quot; he was not vested with a greater entitlement to the position than the employee, the victim of illegal discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded for further fact-finding and reconsideration of the equitable remedies of instatement or, alternatively, front pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a citizen action group, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Bergen County, which dismissed its complaint against defendants, a county improvement authority, a health care group, and others, for failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of two loans made by the authority to the health care group as violating N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, para. 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county to whom the authority belonged decided to have its hospital managed by a private entity, the health care group. In establishing that contractual relationship in 1997, a lease was entered into which transferred operation of the hospital to the health care group for 19 years. Subsequently, the authority provided two loans to the health care group. One was a working capital loan of $ 6 million and the other was an accounts receivable loan of $ 27 million. The complaint alleged that the cash flow from the management fee and patient services established by the lease were sufficient for the operation of the hospital and that the loans were not needed for the public purpose of operating the hospital. Plaintiffs' complaint also alleged that the loans lacked consideration or lacked adequate consideration. In reviewing the complaint, the court was satisfied after viewing the lease and other documents to which the complaint referred, that it stated a cause of action for which relief can be granted. The court noted that factual findings were necessary as to plaintiffs' allegations as to no or inadequate consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment dismissing the complaint and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings, including the resolution of the factual issues as to whether any consideration was provided for with regard to the loans or, in the alternative, whether the consideration was inadequate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County, of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, and second-degree robbery. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial evidence showed that defendant tackled and punched a woman, unsuccessfully tried to find her money, and raped her. After his arrest, defendant admitted having consensual intercourse with the victim. Although his DNA matched DNA recovered from the victim's vagina and underwear, there was some evidence that the semen samples were contaminated. Defendant testified that he had never met or had sex with the victim, and denied telling the police otherwise. The appellate court held that application of the notice of alibi rule, R. 3:12-2, to bar defendant's own testimony as to his whereabouts at the time of the crime, because of his failure to comply with R. 3:12-2, unconstitutionally infringed on defendant's state and federal right to testify, a right emanating from the due process and compulsory process guarantees. The appellate court disagreed with its contrary rulings in State v. Francis, 128 N.J. Super. 346, 320 A.2d 173 (App. Div. 1974), and State v. Gonzalez, 223 N.J. Super. 377, 538 A.2d 1261 (App. Div. 1988). Combined with a highly objectionable prosecutor summation in which he vouched for the victim's credibility with evidence outside the record, the error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Criminal Part, Passaic County, which upheld his conviction of a first-time Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) offense, in violation of N.J.S.A. &sect; 39:4-50(a)(1)(i). Defendant was sentenced to serve 12 hours in treatment center; received a three-month driving suspension; and was ordered to pay fines, penalties and costs. Defendant's sentence was stayed pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence a laboratory report prepared by a State Police chemist and a blood test certificate prepared pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect;&nbsp;2A:62A-11 by a hospital employee who had extracted blood from defendant at the request of a police officer. The court agreed that the blood sample certification in the case at bar was not prepared to assist police with an ongoing emergency. Additionally, the primary purpose of the blood certificate was to preserve evidence for a future anticipated DWI prosecution and the samples were not extracted for purposes of medical treatment. As a result, because defendant was deprived of his constitutional rights of confrontation, the chemist's report and the hospital worker's blood test certificate were improperly admitted as part of the State's evidence at trial. Nevertheless, the court sustained defendant's DWI conviction under N.J.S.A. &sect; 39:4-50 on independent grounds, based upon the arresting police officer's numerous field observations of intoxication that were not contradicted by competing proofs at the municipal trial and were ratified by the lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and lifted the stay of his sentence.</SPAN></P>

The complaint also challenged the zoning board of adjustment's decision as unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious in that the city council did not make an independent determination and did not make sufficient findings to support its decision. The court agreed with the trial court that the the redevelopment plan was adopted as overlay zoning. As such, the court held that where a municipality adopts a redevelopment plan as overlay zoning in a zoning district, the zoning board of adjustment has jurisdiction to grant a variance from the provisions of the plan.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a Mexican hotel corporation, appealed, by leave granted, from an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County, which denied the hotel's motion to dismiss the complaint of plaintiff guest for lack of personal jurisdiction, finding New Jersey law applicable to the guest's personal injury action and declining to dismiss her action on the ground of forum non conveniens. Defendant, a travel agency, was also a party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While staying at the hotel located in Quintana Roo, Mexico, the guest slipped and fell on a wet exterior staircase and broke her ankle. Upon her return to New Jersey, she filed suit. The court agreed with the trial court's determination that the guest had sufficiently demonstrated that the hotel had contacts with New Jersey, consisting of a tour operator contract and marketing activities, which established that a causal relationship existed between those activities and the guest's vacation booking at the hotel to support the assertion of specific personal jurisdiction over the hotel. Traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice were not offended since the hotel was part of a world-wide travel empire well-equipped to defend litigation within the United States, which chose to market itself, through the travel agency, in New Jersey, and, thus, was deemed to have foreseen, and indeed to have induced, the presence of New Jersey guests at its Mexican facility. Though the court upheld the guest's forum choice, it disagreed with the trial court's choice of law decision since the law of Quintana Roo applied to the issues of apportionment of liability and damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff paternal grandparents filed a petition seeking visitation with their grandson. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division-Family Part, Passaic County, granted the grandparents unsupervised weekly visitation pursuant to the New Jersey Grandparent Visitation Statute,&nbsp;N.J.S.A. &sect; 9:2-7.1, and denied the mother's motion for reconsideration. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's mother had sole legal and physical custody; his father had supervised visitation on alternate weekends, monitored by the grandparents. The appellate court reversed the trial judge's grant of unsupervised weekly visitation to the grandparents under the grandparent visitation statute,&nbsp;&sect; 9:2-7.1, as the grandparents' sole proof was that they babysat the toddler on occasion, and the mother was amenable to supervised visitation, possibly once a month. The grandparents' proofs were clearly insufficient to satisfy the high burden of proof of harm required under Moriarty v. Bradt to rebut the presumption in favor of parental decisionmaking. The trial judge made no finding, and the record was devoid of evidence to support a finding, that visitation was necessary and the monthly supervised visitation schedule offered by the mother was inadequate to avoid harm to the child. The trial judge also violated R. 5:3-3 by admitting his appointed expert's report into evidence without offering the mother an opportunity to obtain her own expert, providing a copy to her before the hearing, giving her a reasonable opportunity to depose him, or making him available for cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a builders association and others, challenged the decision of respondent, the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing (COAH). In the appeal, the court addressed appellants' multifaceted challenge to the validity of the substantive rules of the COAH for the third round that calculated affordable housing needs from 1999 to 2014 and established criteria for satisfaction of the need between 2004 and 2014.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants' challenges focused on several rules that governed the calculation of housing need, the allocation of that need, and compliance mechanisms. Appellants contended that COAH's methodology was contrary to, and ill-designed to respond to the constitutional mandate to provide affordable housing to the residents of the State of New Jersey as required by the Mount Laurel doctrine. The court found merit in COAH's methodology for calculating a municipality's rehabilitation share; its decision to no longer reallocate present need; its continued use of regional contribution agreements; and its regulations awarding credits, bonus credits, and vacant land adjustments. The court directed that the subtraction of tax credit developments from statewide and regional housing need must be further addressed by COAH in its rule making and that COAH's use of filtering in calculating statewide and regional housing need was unsupported by the record and required reconsideration. COAH's reliance on unissued data was invalidated as were the regulations that permitted municipalities to provide affordable housing without offsetting benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, in part, certain portions of COAH's methodology but reversed, in part, other portions. The court remanded the case to COAH for promulgation of regulations in conformance with the Mount Laurel doctrine and the FHA within six months. The court also stayed the applications for substantive certification pending the amendment process on the part of COAH.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sheriff and respondent bank cross-appealed the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Morris County, which awarded the sheriff a percentage fee of $ 5,050 based upon N.J.S.A. &sect; 22A:4-8. The bank was a mortgagee and had obtained a judgment in foreclose on certain real property and issued a writ of execution to the sheriff. However, the bank settled with defendant mortgagors before the sheriff's sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff sought the amount of $ 730,000, which was based on the amount of the foreclosure judgment of almost $ 36 million. He asserted that sum was the settlement received by the bank from the mortgagors in consideration of the cancellation of the sheriff's sale. Alternatively, the bank argued that the sheriff was only entitled to the $ 50 minimum statutory fee or, at most, application of the statutory percentages to the $ 250,000 in cash it received from the mortgagors to cancel the sale, which sum, it asserted, was the settlement. Under that theory, the fee was $ 5,050, which the trial court had awarded. The court found N.J.S.A. &sect;&nbsp;22A:4-8 less than clear in that it did not indicate who paid the fee due to the sheriff, what sum the percentage fee was to be based upon, nor whether the percentage should be applied to the value of the property or to the amount of the settlement. The court determined that legislative intent and common sense required the fee for a cancelled mortgage foreclosure judgment to be based on the amount of the settlement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order awarding the sheriff a fee of $ 5,050, based on the settlement amount of $ 250,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two decedents executed wills before N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:38-1(a)(2)(a) was enacted and died after it went into effect. Respondents, the executor and executrix of the decedents' estates, sued appellant, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation, challenging estate taxes imposed under &sect; 54:38-1(a)(2)(a). The Tax Court of New Jersey held that the assessments had to be vacated because they were manifestly unjust. The Director appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 54:38-1(a)(2)(a) imposed a tax on the estate of every New Jersey resident who died after December 31, 2001 that would have been subject to an estate tax under the version of the Internal Revenue Code in effect on December 31, 2001. Section 54:38-1(a)(2)(a) was enacted to preserve the New Jersey estate tax as it existed before sweeping changes were made to the federal estate tax laws. The tax court held that applying &sect; 54:38-1(a)(2)(a) retroactively would be manifestly unjust under the circumstances. The appellate court held that this retroactive estate tax law, which was adopted on July 1, 2002, by L. 2002, c. 31, &sect; 1, applied without exception to all resident decedents dying after December 31, 2001, including those who, like the decedents in question, drafted their wills before the statute was adopted to avoid federal and state taxes in a manner then permitted by law and who died after December 31, 2001, and before the adoption of the statute. The tax court opinion erred in granting the estates exemption from the tax due under the new law by application of the equitable doctrine of manifest injustice because that doctrine had no place in retroactive-taxation cases.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's appeals were argued before the court on the same date, and the court consolidated its opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Camden County, a jury found defendant guilty of first-degree robbery and third-degree hindering prosecution. That trial judge found that defendant used a real gun and sentenced him as a second offender under the Graves Act, N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:43-6(c), (d), (g), and (h) and N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:44-3(d). In Essex County, defendant entered a guilty plea to two second-degree Graves Act crimes: aggravated assault and possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose. The court held that applying Apprendi to second-offender Graves Act mandatory extended-term sentences did not apply retroactively in the context of a collateral review. As to defendant's claim that counsel in both counties were ineffective for failing to move, pursuant to R. 3:25A-1, for consolidation of the indictments for purposes of plea negotiations and sentencing, the court agreed that counsel should have moved for consolidation. However, such failure only established the first prong of defendant's ineffective assistance claims as defendant failed to prove that his counsels' failures would have made a difference since he had rejected a plea offer that was as favorable as any he could have expected in a consolidated plea offer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both orders denying defendant's petition for PCR.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Civil Part, Warren County, granted respondents summary judgment; the landlord appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord owned more than 90 percent of the apartments in the township. The township rent leveling board ordered it to refund overcharges to tenants pursuant to the rent control ordinance. The landlord argued that ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and as applied and could not be extended to vacant apartments. The trial court disagreed. The monopolistic conditions of the rental market provided a rational basis for the ordinance under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:48-2. It interpreted the ordinance as allowing an increase on rents on apartments, occupied or vacant, by no more than three percent per annum per apartment. The appellate court rejected the landlord's constitutionally-based attack on the ordinance and upheld as well its application to vacant apartments. The landlord did not meet its burden to establish a lack of rational basis for the ordinance and failed to show it was denied a just and reasonable return on its investment because of the manner in which the ordinance was interpreted or applied. Its attack on the ordinance as applied for being unconstitutionally vague and overly burdensome was properly rejected as it failed to exhaust its remedies with the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a former real property owner, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Camden County, which dismissed his Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), N.J. Stat. Ann.&nbsp;&sect;&sect; 56:8-1 to -20, claim against defendants, an insurance company and its agent. The owner also appealed the summary judgment dismissal of his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims against defendants, a borough, a chairperson, and his secretary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner had purchased property in the borough with the intent to convert it from residential to commercial. Before the initial closing date, the owner contacted the agent to obtain insurance coverage for the property, paid a premium, and received a declaration sheet for a homeowner's policy. The policy was voided due to a delay in the closing date, and the agent allegedly never informed the owner that a commercial policy was required. Property damage occurred from a storm and allegedly from contractors for which the owner had no coverage. The court held that insurance brokers were semi-professionals who were excluded from liability under the CFA for the services they rendered within the scope of their professional licenses. Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed the CFA claims. The court further held that the owner's constitutional rights were not violated by any stop work orders issued, an alleged failure to give the owner a construction permit, nor for any delay in the borough issuing a resolution memorializing its approval of the owner's application for site plan approval since the owner failed to pursue any administrative and judicial remedies regarding such actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a deputy municipal court administrator, was arrested after a motor vehicle stop during which she caused damage to a police vehicle. Soon thereafter, the assignment judge directed the employee's employer, the city, to terminate her relationship with the municipal court. The city also terminated the employee from employment altogether. The employee's appeal to the Merit System Board resulted in a determination that a portion of her misconduct during the police encounter was brought about by a panic attack, although the Board did find that she engaged in conduct unbecoming of a public employee. The Board also found termination was unreasonable, directing instead that she be suspended without pay for six months. The appellate court held N.J. Ct. R. 1:33-4 did not give the assignment judge jurisdiction over this personnel decision and, if it did, principles of comity required deferral to the Merit System Board. The Board's findings and the six-month suspension were reasonable, in light of lesser sanctions imposed on municipal judges for similar conduct. The New Jersey Supreme Court did not intend N.J. Ct. R. 1:33-4 to envelop this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Ocean County, which convicted him of various crimes, including possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of a weapon while engaged in a drug activity, and child neglect. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of child neglect and that the anti-merger provision of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-4.1(d) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers, acting pursuant to a search warrant, raided defendant's home and obtained evidence against him. On appeal from defendant's convictions, the court held that (1) the failure to give Hampton and Kociolek charges instructing the jury to disregard the alleged oral admission by defendant to a detective that he possessed weapons found in the bedroom unless they found the admission credible did not constitute plain error since two detectives testified that they found the weapons in the room occupied by defendant, within easy reach; (2) that defendant's motion to suppress evidence was properly denied because mistaken or incorrect statements in a search warrant affidavit were insufficient to grant a motion to suppress unless they were intentionally false or made with reckless disregard of the truth; (3) that filthy conditions in defendant's residence were an insufficient basis for a conviction for child neglect; and (4) that the anti-merger provision of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-5(a), requiring separate, consecutive sentences for possession with intent to distribute and possession of a weapon while engaged in drug activity, was constitutional under N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an attorney and the New Jersey State Bar Association, sued defendants, the State of New Jersey and state officials, arguing that &sect;&sect; 5, 6, 7, and 27 (2004 N.J. Laws 17, &sect;&sect; 5, 6, 7, and 27) of the New Jersey Medical Access and Responsibility and Patient's First Act, 2004 N.J. Laws 17, were unconstitutional. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Union County, granted defendants summary judgment. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that certain provisions of the Act violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause; N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1; N.J. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, para. 3 (separation of powers); N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 9 (special legislation); and N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, paras. 2 and 3 (public spending for private purposes). The appellate court disagreed. The Act, (1) imposing a $ 75 tax on persons licensed to practice law in New Jersey; (2) directing complementary dispute resolution of certain medical malpractice actions; (3) authorizing the dismissal of a malpractice action upon a party filing an affidavit of non-involvement; and (4) specifying credentials of individuals executing an affidavit of merit or testifying as an expert witness, was constitutional. 2004 N.J. Laws 17, &sect; 27, imposing the tax on attorneys, was rationally related to a legitimate state interest in providing access to medical care. The Act's &quot;affidavit of noninvolvement&quot; procedure and its provisions for complementary dispute resolution in certain cases did not invade the judiciary's role of creating procedural rules. The Act did not authorize spending public funds on private purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant customer challenged the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Special Civil Part, Essex County, which granted summary judgment on the complaint and dismissal of the customer's counterclaim. The customer also appealed from the award of counsel fees against him. Respondent, a funeral home, had brought a collection action demanding full payment for funeral services rendered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer's counterclaim alleged that the failure to provide the required funeral services contracted for constituted negligence and breach of warranty resulting in emotional distress to the family. The cause of action arose from the customer contracting with the funeral home for the services involving his father-in-law, an orthodox Jew. Watchers, or shomerim, were to have conducted a continuous vigil over the body of the deceased until the time of the funeral. However, it was discovered that only three of the six shifts contracted for appeared. The customer asserted that he was entitled to a substantial discount due to the funeral home's failure to provide the full contracted-for services. The court found no evidential support for the motion judge's conclusion that the contract provisions regarding the enumerated goods and services was severable as such an intent clearly was not manifested by the parties at the time that the contract for services was executed. The court further found that the customer's counterclaim for emotional distress was dismissed in error as caselaw supported the recovery of damages for emotional distress arising out of a breach of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment entered in favor of the funeral home, reversed the dismissal of the customer's counterclaim for breach of contract, and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial. The court also vacated the award of attorney's fees for further determination upon retrial.</SPAN></P>

Following merger of the first two counts, defendant was sentenced to consecutive four-year terms of imprisonment on the second and third counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police executed a warrant to search an apartment that did not authorize a no-knock entry. Upon a look-out warning of the approaching officers, a detective admittedly attempted to gain access to the apartment using a battering ram, without first knocking and announcing his presence. Because the front and rear doors were barricaded, the officers were unable to gain access. The police eventually searched the apartment and seized several vials of cocaine. Defendant asserted on appeal that the evidence seized should have been suppressed because the police violated the knock and announce terms of the warrant. The court disagreed and held that, due to the circumstances, the police acted reasonably to disregard those terms as the look-out created the exigent circumstances by alerting defendant. No due process nor double jeopardy rights of defendant were violated as to the imposition of the consecutive four-year terms of imprisonment since the plain language of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-4.1(c) prohibited merger and ordered consecutive terms for fortifying or maintaining a fortified structure and also for possessing drugs with intent to distribute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two patients, challenged the respective orders with regard to each of them issued by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Camden County, which placed the two patients on continued extension pending placement (CEPP). The court consolidated the appeals to address the legal standards that governed a trial judge's discretion to extend CEPP under N.J. Ct. R. 4:74-7(h)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patients were each released but the court did not find the issues involving each matter moot since the issues raised were likely to arise again in other cases. The first patient sought release but received extended CEPP, despite that patient's mother being willing to have him return home temporarily for a maximum of 90 days. The second patient received CEPP despite her attending psychiatrist testifying that she no longer was a danger to herself by reason of mental illness and the patient's desire to return home to her husband. The court found that the trial judge over extended his discretion in as much as it was not for a trial court to have general responsibility or authority to approve living arrangements in an involuntary commitment matter. The questions the trial judge was required to resolve were limited, after finding that the person was not in need of commitment, to whether there was evidence that supported imposition of continued restrictions under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;30:4-27.15(c) and N.J. Ct. R. 4:74-7(h)(1), or a delay of release pursuant to Rule 4:74-7(h)(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the respective orders placing the two patients on CEPP.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pled guilty to absconding from parole (N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:29-5(b)), he moved to withdraw his guilty plea, to relieve assigned counsel, and to proceed pro se. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Cape May County, denied the motions and sentenced him to five years' imprisonment with a two and one-half year parole bar, to be served concurrent to any sentence imposed for violation of parole. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant maintained on appeal that his guilty plea lacked a factual basis. During the plea colloquy, he admitted violating &sect; 2C:29-5(b) by leaving his assigned residence and by failing to contact his parole officer or to notify him of his new address. However, in response to the trial court's further questioning, he denied that he left his assigned residence for the purpose of hiding. He claimed he did so and became homeless because he was penniless and did not have his psychiatric medication. He also claimed that he called his parole officer &quot;a couple times,&quot; but he was never in the office. The appellate court held that his subsequent admission, that he knew that by not telling his parole officer that he had moved, the officer would not be able to find him, was not sufficient to overcome the exculpatory information he had already placed on the record. When it became clear that he denied an essential element of the crime - hiding with the intent to avoid parole supervision -- the trial court should have refused to accept the plea as it lacked a factual basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Bergen County, which convicted defendant after a jury trial of second-degree robbery, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:15-1, and third-degree possession of a weapon without a permit, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-5(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from a convenience store robbery. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court improperly permitted the State to introduce a statement he made about the location of the gun used in violation of his Miranda rights and that the prosecutor's cross-examination and comments in summation violated his privilege against self-incrimination. The court held that the record developed before the trial court at a N.J. R. Evid. 104 hearing was insufficient, as a matter of law, to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant voluntarily and knowingly waived his constitutional rights under Miranda when he told the arresting officer where the gun was in the store. The court determined that reversal was not the appropriate remedy to correct the error but, rather, remand to the trial court for it to conduct a new hearing on voluntariness was required. The court further discerned no legal basis to reverse defendant's conviction based on an alleged Muhammad violation since defendant testified concerning statements he made to the police when he was arrested in support of his affirmative defense of duress, which the State was entitled to cross-examine him regarding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and remanded the case to the trial court to conduct a new hearing with respect to the admissibility of defendant's statements to the police.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a class action suit against defendants, the State of New Jersey and state officials, challenging a constitutional amendment, N.J.

The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, found the amendment and Act constitutional and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment authorized, and the Act implemented, the posting of identifying information and the whereabouts of sex offenders on the Internet. Plaintiffs alleged the amendment violated their rights under the federal Equal Protection, Ex Post Facto, and Double Jeopardy Clauses and the Act violated the ex post facto, double jeopardy, and privacy provisions of the N.J. Constitution. The appellate court disagreed. The amendment by its clear terms trumped &quot;any other provision&quot; of the N.J. Constitution. Therefore, although it applied to offenders convicted before its effective date, it was not invalidated by state constitutional provisions concerning retroactive impact. As the purpose of the amendment was not to punish, but to protect the public, it did not violate the federal Ex Post Facto and Double Jeopardy Clauses. As it served a legitimate state interest in public safety and did not irrationally target an unpopular group, it did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. It did not violate the federal right to privacy. Challenges to the Act under the ex post facto, double jeopardy, and privacy provisions of the state constitution failed since the amendment was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a pharmaceutical corporation, filed an interlocutory appeal of the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, which certified a nationwide class in the case, found that the common issues among all members of the class predominated, and that New Jersey's Consumer Fraud Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 56:8-1 to -20, applied. Plaintiff, a union welfare fund, had instigated the consumer fraud action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that while attempting to market and sell Vioxx, the pharmaceutical corporation fraudulently misrepresented and suppressed material information regarding the drug and its comparative safety and efficacy. According to plaintiff, third-party payors across the nation were specifically targeted with this false marketing, advertising, and promotion in an attempt to justify the high cost that was being charged for the new drug. The court upheld the certification of the nationwide class upon concluding that a common nucleus of operative facts predominated over questions affecting only individual members of the class. The court noted that although the amounts of loss may differ among the class members, such loss was ascertainable by a classwide expert and that, when aggregate damages were ascertained, a mechanism was easily established to calculate damages due to the individual class members. The court also agreed with the application of the Act to the case and the entire plaintiff class since New Jersey's interests in the litigation far outweighed the interests of all other states and New Jersey had the most significant relationship to the alleged fraud and the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's rulings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother appealed the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Family Part, Bergen County, which denied the mother's motion to assess interest on defendant father's overdue child support. The Bergen County Board of Social Services participated in the appeal, as it did at the trial level, and various amicus curiae were filed. The father had ceased to participate in the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and father were separated and had one minor daughter. The father's child support payment was set at $ 35 per week in 1986. After he moved out-of-state and fell behind in his support payments, the trial court ordered him to pay $ 100 per week, including arrears, collected through the Probation Division of the Administrative Office of the Courts. The trial court denied the mother's request for post-judgment interest upon determining that the Probation Division was not required to collect post-judgment interest on child support arrears and that it did not have the technology to collect the same. The court held that the mother's motion should have been granted and the interest was required to have been added to the child support judgment which was to be collected through the Probation Division. The court noted that the mother calculated the interest on the overdue child support, which was 17 years in arrears. As such, the Probation Division was not required to use its resources to make the calculation and federal law required it to document interest owed on child support judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the case to the trial court for entry of an order adding post-judgment interest to the father's Probation Division support account.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, attorney, appealed the decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Camden County, which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, a city, its council, and its mayor. The summary judgment dismissed the attorney's claims alleging violations of the New Jersey Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 34:19-1 to -8, and his claim against the city for a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney's &sect; 1983 claim against the mayor had gone to trial and the attorney was awarded over $ 300,000 in damages. The attorney had been the public defender for the city for seven years when the mayor terminated his employment. The attorney asserted that he was dismissed in retaliation for reporting an extortion attempt and for providing testimony that implicated the mayor in unlawful activity. On appeal, the attorney sought reinstatement of his CEPA claims and his &sect; 1983 claim against the city, asserting that the city was responsible for his judgment against the mayor under principles of agency and vicarious liability. The mayor was in federal prison and the attorney claimed the mayor was indigent. The court upheld the dismissal of the &sect;&nbsp;1983 claim against the city because the city council, the governing body of the city, never authorized the attorney's termination. The court found, however, that the trial court erred in dismissing the attorney's CEPA claim upon concluding that the attorney was not an employee because the attorney did fit the definition of an employee under the control and relative nature of the work tests and the city was required to have a public defender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, in part, the summary judgment dismissing the attorney's &sect; 1983 claim against the city and reversed, in part, the summary judgment dismissal of the attorney's CEPA claim. The court remanded the CEPA claim to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, former corporate counsel for defendant city, filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs against the city and defendant acting mayor to challenge her removal. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hudson County, granted defendants' motion to dismiss. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the mayor who appointed plaintiff died, the council president became acting mayor and removed plaintiff from her position. She claimed that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:9-131, which allowed the council president to serve as both acting mayor and council president, violated the separation of powers doctrine. The appellate court disagreed. That doctrine was not generally applicable to a mayor-council government, and the acting mayor's action did not encroach on the council's functions, as the council could have countered it under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:69A-43(c). N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40A:9-131 and 40A:16-12 were complementary, and the latter did not invalidate the former. Though N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:9-139 provided a one-year term, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:69A-43(c) authorized the mayor to remove plaintiff earlier unless two-thirds of the council opposed this. As to plaintiff's due process claim, since her employment was terminable at the acting mayor's discretion and her termination did not question her reputation and created no detriment to future employment, she had no property or liberty interest in her position. The acting mayor afforded her sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff consumer challenged the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County, which granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissal filed by defendants, a pharmaceutical company and its laboratory. The consumer had commenced a products liability suit against defendants, primarily asserting a failure-to-warn with regard to the drug Accutane. The consumer was a resident of the State of Michigan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consumer contended that, as a result of taking the prescription drug Accutane in 1997 for the treatment of his severe acne when he was 16 years old, he became severely depressed and attempted suicide several times. The consumer asserted that defendants failed to adequately warn him of the possible psychological side-effects of the drug. The trial court granted defendants summary judgment and dismissed the suit upon determining that Michigan law barred the consumer's claims since Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2946(5) provided immunity to defendants. The court stated that the sole issue on review was whether New Jersey or Michigan law governed the consumer's failure-to-warn claim since a true conflict existed. The court concluded that the quality of New Jersey's contacts in the case, when combined with its strong governmental interest in deterring the manufacture of unsafe products within its borders, substantially outweighed the countervailing Michigan contacts and governmental interests in application of the Michigan statute. As such, the court held that New Jersey law applied to the consumer's products liability failure-to-warn claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a committee of residents of a planned community and three individual members, and defendants, the community's homeowners' association, the community's trust, and the president of the association, cross-appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, General Equity, Mercer County. Plaintiffs sued for declaratory and injunctive relief regarding free speech and assembly rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' suit sought mandatory injunctive relief permitting the posting of political signs on the property of community residents and on common areas, use of the community room, equal access to the community's official newspaper, tape recording of board meetings, access to the association's financial records, and a list of all voting members. Summary judgment was granted to each party on the various counts of the complaint. The court acknowledged the growth of planned communities consisting of privately owned homes and commercial buildings that were open to the public but were trust-owned properties and facilities for the exclusive use of the residents and their invited guests. The main issue was that, much like a shopping mall, the community was like a town that delivered a broad range of traditional municipal services to its residents. As such, the community had a quasi-municipal status which subjected it to the constitutional limitations set forth in N.J. Const. art. I, paras. 6 and 18 as to the residents' expressive rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to defendants with regard to the financial records, alternative dispute resolution, and weighted voting issues. The court vacated the order dismissing the complaint and reversed the general ruling that the association was not subjected to constitutional limitations. Plaintiffs' expressive rights issues were remanded for reconsideration under the proper standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found a juvenile delinquent for criminal mischief with disposition adjourned for six months. He pled guilty to a later delinquency petition, resulting in probation on both delinquencies since the second occurred within six months of the first. He was ordered to submit a DNA sample under the Act. He appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the Act. He argued that his criminal mischief acts occurred before the effective date of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 53:1-20.20(h), which encompassed juveniles within the DNA sampling requirement, so the order violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws contained in either U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, or N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, para. 3. He also argued the sample was a violation of his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under either U.S. Const. amend. IV or N.J. Const. art. I, para. 7. The court found that the Act was not penal in nature, so ex post facto did not apply. It also found that taking the sample was a reasonable and minimal intrusion that was substantially outweighed by the State's interest in detecting recidivist offenders and in accurately identifying the perpetrators of crimes.</SPAN></P>

One defendant was also convicted of third-degree aggravated assault on a police officer and speeding, and the other was also convicted of simple assault. Each defendants' convictions were upheld on direct appeal. Defendants asserted in their post conviction relief motions that, the highway stop, subsequent questioning, and request from one defendant for consent to search were based upon unlawful profiling and should have been excluded as fruit of the poisonous tree. The court agreed with defendants that, without the requested discovery, including the trooper's individual records, defendants were unable to establish unlawful profiling and were denied the opportunity to challenge the trooper's credibility on the basis of his alleged history of profile stops.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's motion to suppress the gun found in that search should have been granted. The tipster's physical description had been general, and there was not enough detail about the alleged criminal activity to provide corroboration. The location, the hour, and even defendant's nervousness did not provide a sufficient basis to believe criminal activity was afoot. The State had also argued that the search was incident to a lawful arrest, but that argument also failed. Defendant had a right to try to leave an unlawful detention, so he should not have been arrested when he ran. Since the arrest was not lawful, neither was the search.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a school district, challenged the final determination of the Director of the Division on Civil Rights (New Jersey), which found that the district violated the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;10:5-1 to -49, because complainant student was subjected to harassment by other students on the basis of his perceived sexual orientation. The director imposed equitable relief and awarded compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was subjected to numerous instances of bias-based harassment at his intermediate school by at least 18 different students in less than four months. The student also experienced such harassment while in high school and had suffered several physical assaults. The harassment revolved around the student's alleged perceived sexual orientation of being homosexual and he was repeatedly called a homo, fagot, and other derogatory terms. The director awarded the student $ 50,000 for emotional distress and his mother $ 10,000. The district was also ordered to take certain remedial actions in the nature of strengthening its anti-discrimination policy by explicitly stating such discrimination was prohibited, establish written procedures for staff to follow, to post such procedures, and distribute the same to all staff. The court upheld the viability of the claim and the award to the student but found that the director was required to reconsider the remedial measures ordered and to, instead, consider the statutory mandates set forth in N.J. Admin. Code tit. 6A, &sect; 7-1.4(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, in part, the decision with regard to the remedial measures ordered and remanded the case to the director for reconsideration of those mandates in light of the educational equity policies adopted by the district and any other actions taken to address peer harassment on the basis of sexual orientation. The court also reversed the award of damages to the mother. Otherwise, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He also appealed the denial of his motion for discovery that led to the dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief. He sought discovery to support his claim that he had been the victim of racial profiling in the stop of a motor vehicle that had led to the discovery of the drugs on which the CDS charges were based and to the events that generated the other charges. Asserting the attenuation exception to the exclusionary rule defendant sought to rely on, the State filed a counter-motion to remove the case from selective discovery proceedings. The trial judge ruled that defendant was not entitled to discovery by reason of the attenuation exception as defendant and codefendant acted illegally in resisting arrest after they were unlawfully stopped based on their race. The matter was remanded back to Passaic County for disposition on the merits of the postconviction relief application. The appellate court held that while it rejected the practice of racial profiling, it also disfavored resistive and threatening conduct by a person unlawfully stopped or detained against the offending police officers. No good public purpose was served by ignoring or rewarding such anti-social acts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed both as to the denial of the requested discovery and the dismissal of defendant's petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:47-1 to -10 (the Act); defendant claimed, inter alia, that the Act was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Between 1991 and 1997, defendant committed one or more acts of sexual abuse upon his nieces, who were less than 13 years old at the time. Defendant claimed that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time. At a hearing to determine defendant's eligibility for confinement to the ADTC, the parties' experts used the common English language definitions of &quot;repetitive,&quot; meaning something that happens more than once, and &quot;compulsive,&quot; meaning an irresistible urge to perform some irrational behavior. The appellate court held that although the Act did not define the terms &quot;repetitive&quot; or &quot;compulsive,&quot; they were to be given their ordinary and well-understood meanings. Because the definitions were not abstract and could be understood by a citizen of average intelligence, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:47-1 to -10 were not unconstitutionally vague. The trial court found that defendant's conduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior at the time it found him qualified for confinement at the ADTC as well as at the time the offenses were committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grandmother appealed from an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Family Part, Morris County, that dismissed her complaint under the New Jersey Grandparent Visitation Statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2-7.1, seeking visitation with her grandchildren despite the objections of defendant parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother and the parents had always differed in their child-rearing ideas, and the parents had never encouraged contact between the grandmother and the grandchildren. The grandmother brought an action under the Visitation Statute, indicating in her pleadings that contact with grandparents was a good thing and that the children were being deprived of potentially happy memories. The court followed New Jersey case law that interpreted the Statute in a manner that did not violate parents' due process rights to raise their children as they saw fit. Therefore, a grandparent seeking visitation had to show that failure to order visitation would actually harm the children; this would also normally entail a showing of a close relationship of long standing. The grandmother argued that she needed discovery to show that harm could result, but the court held that such a requirement would put too heavy a financial and psychological burden on families. Since the grandmother had failed even to allege that harm would result, dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a Superior Court, Law Division, Bergen County (New Jersey), order quashing a subpoena issued by the State requiring an investigator for movant New Jersey Supreme Court Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct (ACJC) to testify, and produce records, regarding a disciplinary investigation of defendant judge, one of three defendants in the underlying criminal action. The ACJC claimed confidentiality under N.J. Ct. R. 2:15-20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a municipal judge and two other local officials, had been accused of tampering with public records in order to do an illegal favor for a jail inmate. The ACJC had commenced a judicial disciplinary investigation at the same time the State commenced its criminal investigation. Defendants were eventually indicted, and the State subpoenaed the ACJC's investigation results. The trial court based its decision to quash the subpoena on the N.J. Ct. R. 2:15-20 designation of such materials as confidential, but the court held that the rule did not apply once the reason for its existence could no longer be served. The rule protected the privacy of judges until they had actually been found to have engaged in misconduct, at which point the ACJC's findings were no longer protected by confidentiality. Once a judge had been indicted in the same matter, there was no privacy protection, as in the case of any other defendant. At that point, the strong public policy favoring disclosure trumped the rule's protection.</SPAN></P>

The lower court judge invalidated the ordinance. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county passed an ordinance directing contractors to provide an increased minimum wage and mandatory health benefits to their employees providing food, janitorial, unarmed security guard, and home health care services. On appeal, the court found that the provider's equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1 were not violated as the county did not arbitrarily target the contractors but investigated the stability and needs of contracting industries and enacted the ordinance appropriately. Further, the ordinance rationally related to a legitimate government purpose and was not arbitrary or discriminatory. While the appeal was pending, the New Jersey Legislature amended N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:11-56a4 to permit political subdivisions to establish standards providing wages and protections greater than those required by state or federal law. As a result, the county was then proposing a new ordinance reestablishing a living wage and providing for defined health benefits. Accordingly, the issue of impermissible vagueness in the ordinance was rendered moot by the amendment to &sect; 34:11-56a4 and the county's consideration of a new ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient received treatment from the physician following an automobile accident. At the time of the accident, the patient was insured for Personal Injury Protection (PIP) benefits under a policy issued by the insurer. After the insurer denied coverage, the physician took an assignment of the patient's claim and filed a demand for PIP arbitration seeking to recover medical expenses totaling $ 5,494.44. An umpire was appointed. The insurer defended, claiming that the physician violated the Patient Records Rule, N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13, &sect; 35-6.5(b), requiring physicians to maintain contemporaneous permanent treatment records. Accepting the insurer's defense, the umpire found that physician's failure to satisfy the requirements of the Patient Records Rule precluded his recovery of PIP benefits. A new umpire subsequently found that the insurer acted in bad faith by allowing its counsel to raise that Rule when it had the records in its file. That decision of bad faith was reversed by another umpire, and the attorney fee award was adjusted. The court held that the reasonableness of the bad faith decision was not within its purview of review but that the attorney fee award was.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant convicted of drug possession appealed from a Superior Court, Law Division, Passaic County (New Jersey), direction that he submit to collection of a biological sample pursuant to the New Jersey DNA Database and Databank Act of 1994 (DNA Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 53:1-20.17 to -20.20. He argued that the DNA Act violated his state and federal rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DNA Act had been expanded far beyond its original focus on violent offenders and sex offenders. Defendant argued that as a small-time drug offender the law was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court held, first, that under a special needs analysis used to determine whether a particular intrusion violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 7, it was clear that the minimal intrusion necessary to collect DNA samples accomplished many purposes beyond ordinary law enforcement. Furthermore, persons convicted of crimes or found not guilty by reason of insanity had greatly diminished privacy expectations. To determine whether requiring defendant to provide a sample violated his equal protection guarantees under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, the court looked to whether the law had a rational relationship to the public interest that outweighed private interests. It found that the public interest in reducing recidivism as to all types of crimes justified the classification used.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the challenged portion of the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted interlocutory review to appeals by both the State and defendant from an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Morris County, establishing procedures for determining whether defendant's alleged mild mental retardation made him ineligible for the death penalty, setting a preliminary hearing before the court and a later proceeding before a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the nation's highest court, in Atkins, held that execution of mentally retarded defendants violated the Eighth Amendment, it left it to the states to determine how to assure that such executions did not occur. The trial court, the first in New Jersey to confront the issue, eager to resolve such issues as early as possible, ordered a pretrial hearing, before the judge, at which defendant would have an opportunity to show retardation by clear and convincing evidence. In the absence of such a showing, and if defendant were found guilty, he would have another opportunity, before the penalty phase, to argue mental retardation, at which point it would be the State's burden to show absence of retardation beyond a reasonable doubt. While the first proceeding put an improper burden on defendant, the second was affirmed as an appropriate means of implementing the Atkins directive. The Sixth Amendment probably, and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 9 certainly, required a jury finding on the issue of mental retardation as its absence was a trigger for death penalty eligibility and thus a fact affecting sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the order that required a pretrial hearing on the retardation issue but affirmed that portion of the order that directed a jury determination of the issue between the guilt and penalty phases of defendant's trial, if he were found guilty at the guilt phase. It remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Morris County, which found him guilty of reckless manslaughter and robbery and sentenced defendant to consecutive nine-year terms of imprisonment for reckless manslaughter and robbery with 85 percent parole disqualifiers on each count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went to a pub and met up with the victim. The victim offered to pay defendant for sex and suggested that they have sex by the nearby railroad tracks. The two men went to another bar and then went to the railroad tracks where, according to defendant, the victim told him that he was either going to have sex voluntarily or be forced. The men started fighting, and defendant struck the victim in the throat with a karate chop using the side of his hand. The victim fell face down in the river, and defendant then stole the victim's necklace. The victim died from fatal injuries to his throat and neck. A jury convicted him of reckless manslaughter and robbery. On appeal, the court found that the robbery conviction could not stand because it was based on an erroneous jury instruction that allowed the jury to convict based on the &quot;afterthought concept&quot; not found in N,J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:15-1. However, the court found that the elements of third-degree theft were clearly present, as defendant admitted he stole from the victim. Because defendant had no prior convictions, the court found that the recidivism exception expressed in Blakely was inapplicable and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and vacated the robbery conviction and remanded for entry of a conviction on the third-degree offense of theft from the person and sentencing on that charge. The court vacated the sentence for reckless manslaughter and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An openly gay student at a Catholic university applied to the university's department of student affairs for provisional recognition of a gay and lesbian student organization. The vice president of student affairs denied his application, stating that the guidance from the Catholic Church opposed an exclusive focus on a person's sexual orientation. Although she stated that the department was prepared to work with gay and lesbian students to meet their needs, the student filed suit. The suit was dismissed but reinstated. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that it was not error to dismiss the complaint because the LAD's prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orientation, N.J. Stat. &sect; 10:5-3, did not apply to religiously affiliated institutions such as the university. Although the student claimed that the university waived its religious exemption by publishing its antidiscrimination policy, the court held that the exemption under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-5(1) could not be waived. The court found also that the university's antidiscrimination policy did not create a unilateral contract, because a contractual relationship could not be based on isolated provisions in a manual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff couples sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, dismissing their action brought against defendant government officials alleging that the denial of their applications for marriage licenses violated their due process and equal protection rights under the New Jersey Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The couples, all homosexual couples, applied for marriage licenses, which were denied by the government officials. The couples brought an action contending that the denial of the licenses violated their due process and equal protection rights under the New Jersey Constitution. The government officials responded with a motion to dismiss, which was granted, and the couples appealed the judgment. The court noted that N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1, protected both substantive and procedural due process rights, which included the right to privacy. While privacy considerations protected the right to heterosexual marriage, the court concluded that homosexual marriage was not a right rooted in the traditions and collective conscience of the people of New Jersey as to be ranked as fundamental. Evaluation of the equal protection clause, N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1, required a balancing test that considered the nature of the affected right, the extent to which the governmental restriction intruded upon it, and the public need for restriction. Here the couples failed to meet the first prong of the test and show an affected right. Accordingly, the dismissal of the action was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue in the instant appeal was whether money judgments issued by courts in foreign nations could be filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court and enforced in New Jersey without a prior judicial determination recognizing the judgments and authorizing their enforcement within the State. The appeals court agreed that they could. Further, although reduced by order of the English court, the judgments had not been vacated in their entirety and remained on file with the Clerk of the Court. Therefore, the issue as to whether the English judgments should have been filed without prior judicial authorization was not moot. Third, the court was not convinced that the Legislature intended that the Act would be merely a means to obtain recognition of a foreign country's judgment. Finally, concerns about the constitutionality of the filing pursuant to N.J. Stat.

First Amendment case law suggested that requests by candidates that names of allied candidates be bracketed together constituted protected political speech. When they attempted to lay out a ballot for an upcoming primary, the clerks decided that it would not be possible to place seven names of candidates for high office in the manner required by the statute, while also leaving bracketed groups together, so they produced a variant, partly in reliance on opinions of another trial court and New Jersey's Attorney General that questioned &sect; 19:23-26.1's constitutionality. The appellate court considered the issue de novo and held that it had by no means been shown that the statute could not be enforced without violating the First Amendment. Therefore, despite the discretion normally accorded to county clerks in performing their election-related duties, the court ordered them to comply with the statute by conducting a new drawing and abiding by the results.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's order and remanded the matter with directions to have the candidates draw lots for ballot positions, while continuing to do whatever could be done to protect the candidates' rights to have bracketed placement with any associated candidates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission, adopted resolutions amending a redevelopment agreement with intervenor developer. The agreement related to a portion of a district. Petitioner radio stations owned land in the district to operate their radio stations and wanted building height limited to prevent interference with radio signals broadcast from their towers. The stations invoked &quot;Rule 2:2-3(a)(2)&quot; and appealed from the resolutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The redevelopment agreement initially addressed plans for commercial, recreational, and residential uses but did not establish a particular project design or site plan. The Commission held hearings on proposed amendments to the redevelopment agreement to define more specific uses. The stations appeared, testified, and submitted expert opinions that the taller proposed buildings in the project area could interfere with their radio stations' broadcast signals to the extent, possibly, of requiring the radio stations to cease operations. The stations' objections to the Commission's resolution included that it did not fully consider the stations' evidence. However, since the Commission's actions were quasi-legislative, rather than quasi-judicial, the Commission complied with procedural due process requirements by giving public notice and holding a public hearing. Even though the Commission was a state agency, it was compared to a municipality that was enacting a zoning ordinance. If the stations wanted to litigate that the planned development of the district effected a taking or a reverse taking of their pre-district property rights, then their proper forum was the court's law division.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court dismissed the appeal without prejudice to the rights of the stations to vindicate their claims in a proceeding in lieu of prerogative writs in the law division.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of New Jersey in the Law Division at Morris County, which convicted him on a downgraded charge of harassment in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:33-4(a) in connection with a call he made to 9-1-1 and which sentenced him to a fine and three days of jail time already served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially charged with an improper 9-1-1 call in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:33-3e for a profane call he made to 9-1-1 complaining about a police roadblock that delayed him on the way to his mother's medical emergency. The prosecutor downgraded the charge to harassment under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:33-4(a). Defendant appealed his conviction on several grounds, including a challenge as to whether the language he used could be considered harassment under the statute. The court found that defendant's language in venting his frustration about the roadblock, while impolite and rude, was not evidence of a purpose to harass another within the meaning of &sect; 2C:33-4. The State conceded that the call was not at an inconvenient time where 9-1-1 was a 24-hour service. Moreover, the profane language, standing alone, did not establish defendant's intent to harass. The trial court improperly inferred a purpose to harass merely since defendant committed one of the stand-alone offenses listed under &sect; 2C:33-4(a). Finally, all the evidence in the record contradicted any finding of an intent to harass, which was a required element for a conviction, or that the operator felt harassed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
