</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed an order from the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), which reduced a charge against defendant for trafficking in cannabis in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(a) (2002) to a charge of possession of cannabis. Defendant filed a motion for rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested and charged with trafficking in cannabis in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(a) (2002) after officers recovered 55 cannabis plants, weighing 30 pounds total. Defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that 300 plants were needed to sustain a trafficking charge. The trial court granted defendant's motion and allowed him to plead guilty to a possession count. The State appealed. Defendant filed a motion for rehearing of the court's reversal of that order. He challenged for the first time whether the court had jurisdiction to review an order reducing a criminal charge. The court noted that on prior cases, it had ruled that it did have jurisdiction. The court adhered to its prior determination that the statutory definition of cannabis under Fla. Stat. ch. 893.02(3) (2001) did not distinguish between processed and unprocessed cannabis. Therefore, 25 pounds of cannabis, which was the statutory minimum for a trafficking offense, was 25 pounds of cannabis either in processed or unprocessed form. The court held that since defendant had 30 pounds of cannabis, albeit in unprocessed form, the trial court erred in reducing the trafficking charge to a possession charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted defendant's motion for rehearing, withdrew its previous order, and entered a new opinion which, nevertheless, reversed the order reducing the charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owners sought review of the dismissal of their complaint with prejudice by the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida). The property owners argued that the trial court erred in dismissing the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim as well as the remaining counts for declaratory relief. The property owners had challenged the facial constitutionality of certain statutes and ordinances dealing with code violation procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners began evicting a tenant for unpaid rent from their trailer park. A county code inspector, whom they had seen coming and going from the same tenant's trailer, told the property owners that if they moved forward with the eviction, he would &quot;cause them many problems.&quot; Immediately thereafter, the property owners were cited for code violations. A code inspector filed affidavits of noncompliance. Relying solely on that affidavit of noncompliance and without conducting any further hearing, the code enforcement board imposed fines on the property owners. The appellate court concluded that the property owners' allegations sufficiently alleged a cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The allegations were sufficient to invoke the trial court's jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of the challenged statutes and ordinances. The property owners' facial constitutional challenges could not be barred by failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The evidence of a code violation and failure to cure the violation in the first action was not essential to the second action. Thus, the actions were not the same and res judicata did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for Osceola County (Florida), which summarily denied his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his motion, defendant challenged the three-year mandatory minimum sentence which was imposed on his conspiracy to traffic in cocaine conviction pursuant to the sentencing enhancements set forth in 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188, arguing that the sentence was illegal because 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 had been held unconstitutional. The appellate court concluded that, in denying defendant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800 motion, the trial court relied upon a decision from which the appellate court had since receded. Thus, defendant's sentence was illegal and he was entitled to have it corrected. The State argued that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800 relief was not warranted because defendant could not demonstrate any prejudice resulting to him from the imposition of a three-year mandatory minimum sentence where he had to serve 85 percent of his 48 month sentence pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 944.275(4)(b)3 (2001). However, even though the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment would have no impact on the length of defendant's incarceration, the trial court was nevertheless required to strike the mandatory minimum term from defendant's sentencing documents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to strike the mandatory minimum term from his sentence. The appellate court certified a conflict with another case.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 188.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Chapter 188 provided for mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offenses. For a certain period of time, ch. 188 was an unconstitutional violation of the single-subject rule of the Florida Constitution. In 2002, the Florida Legislature reenacted the substantive provisions of ch. 188 and cured the single-subject violation. The Legislature also purported to make the new law retroactive to the date of the 1999 statute. However, the court found the retroactive reach of 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 212 in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the U.S. and Florida Constitutions. Thus, 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 was void, and 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 212 applied prospective only from the date of its enactment. The State conceded that the date of defendant's offense fell within the window for asserting challenges to the minimum mandatory sentence and agreed that defendant's sentence was illegal. The court ruled that those persons committing offenses between July 1, 1999, and April 29, 2002, should be sentenced under the 1997 Florida Statutes. Accordingly, the court ordered that defendant should be resentenced under Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court reversed defendant's sentence and remanded the cause for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

After defendant's sentence was corrected twice, an agreed order was entered by the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), which imposed a sentence of five concurrent 39-year sentences and an eight-year mandatory minimum. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court incorrectly scored all five attempted murder convictions as primary offenses. The appellate court held that any scoresheet error was not harmless, as the most recent sentencing order imposed a guidelines sentence. Defendant was a Heggs defendant and was sentenced under the 1994 Florida Sentencing Guidelines. Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.702 applied, as it was specific to the 1994 Guidelines. Under Rule 3.703(d)(3), only one offense could be scored as the primary offense. Even if the &quot;one offense&quot; language was construed to include multiple counts, the language was at least ambiguous and under the rule of lenity, it was construed most favorably to the accused. The grid and the Commission Note relied on in cases decided under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.701 to find that multiple counts should be scored as primary offenses were inapplicable to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.702 cases. Further, the form associated with Rule 3.702 did not show a calculation method for additional counts of a primary offense and had only one blank for the primary offense. Only one of defendant's attempted murder counts should have been scored as a primary offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sentencing order was reversed on the multiple conviction ground and the case was remanded. The order was affirmed on all other issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction from the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida) denying his motion to correct illegal sentence, filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a). His plea colloquy established that he understood that he could be habitualized and he was sentenced on each count as a habitual violent felony offender with a mandatory minimum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In three counts, defendant was charged with attempted first degree murder with a firearm, a life felony, and attempted robbery with a firearm. The State agreed to omit the firearm so that he could receive an enhanced sentence for that count as a habitual felony offender. He entered no contest pleas and the colloquy established that he knew that he could be habitualized. He was sentenced on each of the two counts to 25 years' imprisonment as a habitual violent felony offender with a 15-year mandatory minimum. A firearm mandatory minimum was imposed only with respect to the second count. On appeal, the court rejected his contention that his first count was reduced from a life felony because he possessed a handgun instead of a firearm, holding that the two were synonymous as a matter of law. As for his sentence, the court held that he had pleaded to a first degree felony, and his habitualized sentence was not improper. As for his 15-year mandatory minimum for count two, because attempted robbery with a firearm was a second degree felony, he was subject only to a mandatory minimum 10-year sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 812.155(3) (2001) unconstitutional because it created a special law, which was prohibited by Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 11(a). A special law was one relating to, or designed to operate upon, particular persons or things, or one that purported to operate upon classified persons or things when classification was not permissible or the classification adopted was illegal. A general law operated universally throughout the state, or uniformly upon subjects as they might exist throughout the state. The appellate court held that the statute was not a prohibited special law, as it did not operate only upon particular persons or things, nor did it operate only in a specially indicated part of the state. Rather, Fla. Stat. ch. 812.155(3) (2001) operated on all those persons who failed to return leased property under the circumstances specified in the statute. The appellate court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 812.155(3) (2001) was not a constitutionally prohibited special law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State challenged the judgment entered. In response, defendant argued that the phrase &quot;in excess of 25 pounds of cannabis&quot; referred only to processed cannabis and that unprocessed cannabis plants, though weighing more than 25 pounds, did not meet the statute's requirements for trafficking unless they reach 300 in number. The appeals court disagreed. The statutory definition of cannabis did not distinguish between processed and unprocessed cannabis. Therefore, 25 pounds of cannabis was 25 pounds of cannabis, whether it was in processed or unprocessed form. Since defendant had 30 pounds of cannabis, albeit in unprocessed form, the trial court erred in reducing the trafficking charge to a possession charge. Defendant's alternative argument that Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(a) was unconstitutional failed, as 2002 Fla. Laws 212, and not 1999 Fla. Laws 188 governed.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 289 unconstitutional as a special or local law which had not been adopted in compliance with Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10, and permanently enjoined the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) from issuing any exemptions pursuant to that law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">2003 Fla. Laws ch. 289 authorized the AHCA to issue hospitals in Palm Beach, Polk, Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River Counties exemptions from certificate of need review for the establishment of open-heart-surgery programs when the applications for exemption complied with certain criteria. On appeal, appellees, hospitals and other healthcare-related entities, argued that, because the Attorney General of Florida had elected not to participate in the appeal in any capacity, Fla. Stat. ch. 86.091 (2003) required dismissal of the appeal. The appellate court concluded that appellants were entitled to prosecute the appeal. The Attorney General participated in the litigation at the trial level, as counsel for the AHCA, and he was aware of the appeal. Thus, the requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 86.091 had been met, and the presence of the Attorney General was not required in the appeal. In addition, the trial court correctly held 2003 Fla. Laws ch. 289 unconstitutional as a special or local law which had not been adopted in compliance with Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. The law created a closed class limited to five counties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that his classification as a prison releasee reoffender (PRR) was improper because 1999 Fla.

Defendant alleged that he committed his offense during the period between the unconstitutional enactment of the amended statute and the legislature's reenactment of the changes curing the constitutional infirmity. The appellate court could not determine from the limited record before it whether defendant was adversely affected by the unconstitutional amendments to the PRR statute. 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 did not create the PRR statute. It simply made some changes to a preexisting PRR statute. If defendant qualified as a prison releasee reoffender under the prior statute, he was not adversely affected by the unconstitutional revision and would not be entitled to relief. The Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion filed by defendant did not demonstrate that his sentence was illegal on its face.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Miami-Dade County (Florida), which denied his motion to correct illegal sentence. Defendant was convicted on two counts of robbery with a pistol, burglary without a firearm, and two counts of kidnapping with a pistol, and was sentenced to concurrent 10-year terms for robbery and burglary convictions, and to life for the kidnapping convictions, to be served consecutive to the first robbery count.</SPAN></P>

Procedural due process challenges had previously been rejected by the instant court and other district courts of appeal. Concerning substantive due process, defendant argued that ch. 943.0435 improperly lacked any requirement of guilty knowledge, scienter, or mens rea. However, the Florida Supreme Court rejected this argument, and held that ch. 943.0435 had to be construed as including a knowledge requirement. Finally, defendant's remaining arguments lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant raised numerous issues on appeal. Affirming the circuit court's decision, the court held, inter alia, that (1) the trial court did not err in allowing the testimony of a psychologist who employed three actuarial instruments in determining appellant's likelihood of recidivism; (2) appellant failed to state an equal protection claim based on his contention that he was forced to testify against himself because he did not demonstrate that he was similarly situated to defendants in other types of civil proceedings; (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the admission of hearsay evidence, and appellant's constitutional challenge to Fla. Stat. ch. 394.9155(5) (1999) had no merit; and (4) appellant failed to show that the Department of Family and Children Service's failure to promulgate rules under the Act, as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 394.930 (2000), violated equal protection principles. The court also certified the following question to the state supreme court: May an individual be committed under the Act in the absence of a jury instruction that the State must prove that the individual has serious difficulty in controlling his or her dangerous behavior?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company challenged a tax assessed against it based on a lack of a tax exemption for failing to be a registered dealer. At the same time, it filed a motion for the court to approve an alternative security arrangement under Fla. Stat. ch. 72.011 (1995) wherein the company would pay the amount of the assessment it did not dispute. That arrangement was approved, the company filed a motion for summary judgment in its favor, which was granted, and the Department appealed. The Department claimed the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction because the company failed to satisfy the statutory jurisdiction requirements of paying the entire taxes due or else obtaining the Department's approval for the alternative security arrangement. The court found that the statute allowed the trial court to approve the alternative security arrangement regardless of approval by the Department. Therefore, the jurisdictional requirements were satisfied. Moreover, since the evidence showed that the company was a registered dealer, was designated as such on the Department's own records, and no proof that the registration was cancelled existed, the summary judgment decision was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in the company's favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A few days after his birth, the child was taken into the Department's custody. Both the child and his mother had tested positive for cocaine. A few months later, the Department placed the child with the foster parents. At the same time, the Department contacted the mother's cousin, who lived in Tennessee. She and her husband were interested in adopting the child. Three months later the guardian ad litem reported that the child was being well-cared for and loved by his foster parents, who were planning to adopt him. The guardian also reported that she had met with the cousin and her husband and that they also seemed to be loving and caring people. The Department selected the relatives as the adoptive parents. The foster parents appealed, and the trial court ruled that they did not have standing to appeal and that it did not have authority to interfere with the Department's selection of the adoptive parents. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that the foster parents had standing to appeal under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.230 and that the trial court should have conducted a hearing to consider whether the change in placement was in the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order and remanded to the trial court to hold a hearing to determine whether the change in placement was in the child's best interests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was originally convicted for attempted second degree murder of a law enforcement officer. A new trial was granted. Defendant was then convicted for aggravated assault on an officer. The State requested at least the mandatory minimum sentence under Fla. Stat. ch. 784.07(2)(c) (1999), but the trial court downwardly departed by sentencing defendant to time served. Both parties appealed. The court found the departure was authorized at the time by case law holding that ch. 784.07(2)(c) was unconstitutional. But, subsequent case law upheld the statute and defendant had to be resentenced to the mandatory minimum. Defendant argued the State had to file an amended information prior to the new trial. The court held that an amended information was not required since defendant was tried on a lesser included offense and the last information alleged all the elements of aggravated assault. The court also rejected defendant's argument that marijuana found in his car should have been excluded under the Williams rule as overly prejudicial. The evidence was a conceivable motive for defendant's attempt to evade officers and a limiting instruction was delivered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed two orders by the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida) which granted defendants' motions to dismiss on the grounds that the statutory scheme they were charged under was unconstitutionally vague. Defendants were charged with keeping a gambling house, contrary to Fla. Stat. ch. 849.01 (2003), and possession of coin-operated devices (slot machines), contrary to Fla. Stat. ch. 849.15 (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants operated an arcade amusement center with at least 50 amusement games, which they believed to be permissible under the Fla. Stat. ch. 849.161 (2003) arcade amusement center exception to Fla. Stat. ch. 849. The player inserted cash into the machine and depressed a button, whereby a series of rotating icons began to spin. The player then depressed the button to stop the spinning icons, attempting to line up the icons in certain combinations. A certain number of credits could be exchanged for gift certificates redeemable at various businesses. Some businesses redeemed the gift certificates for merchandise and cash. While skill affected the outcome, there was also an element of chance. The appellate court held defendants' conduct was clearly not protected under Fla. Stat. ch. 849.161(1)(a)(1). Thus, defendants could not sustain a void for vagueness claim, and the court did not reach defendants' argument that Fla. Stat. ch. 849.161(1)(a)(1) was vague when read in conjunction with Fla. Stat. ch. 849.15. Defendants' machines were not coin operated, as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 849.161(1)(a)(1) since they did not accept quarters and were operated by cash bills.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The orders of the trial court were reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court for Osceola County (Florida) dismissed all of the counts set forth in the third amended complaint, with prejudice. The property owners appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners wanted to borrow approximately $ 600,000 to be used in a business venture. The investors executed an agreement which created a land trust, in which they invested money in return for proportional interests. The terms of an option to repurchase stated that if the owners exercised their right to repurchase in the first year following the sale, the repurchase price was to be $ 1.2 million, and if they exercised the option in the second year following the sale, the price would be $ 1.8 million. If the property was not repurchased in two years, the land trust had the right to sell its one-half interest. The owners experienced financial difficulties, and later deeded their remaining one-half interest in the property to the trust. The owners were unable to exercise the repurchase option. The appellate court held that the allegations were sufficient to plead a cause of action in usury. The court held that the transaction constituted a loan, and that the return expected by the investors, either double or triple their investment, equated to an interest rate which exceeded the permissible amount in Fla. Stat. ch. 687.071(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for St. Johns County (Florida) summarily denied defendant's motion for post-conviction relief, filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a), in which he alleged that a 15-year sentence imposed against him upon a conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon was illegal. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment entered against him. It was not clear from the record whether he was sentenced as an habitual felony offender or a violent felony offender for the aggravated assault with a deadly weapon conviction, but the maximum sentence for a habitual felony offender was 10 years, with a five-year minimum mandatory sentence if he was found to be a violent felony offender. While defendant agreed to the longer 15-year sentence, such did not bar him from attacking the same as an illegal sentence. Because the aggravated assault with a deadly weapon count was only one of several counts that resulted in consecutive and concurrent sentences totaling 75 years, the appeals court only vacated the sentence for the aggravated assault with a deadly weapon count, rejecting defendant's claim that his sentence for aggravated battery was also illegal. But, on remand, the State was allowed the option of agreeing to a legal sentence on the aggravated assault with a deadly weapon count, or withdrawing from the plea agreement and proceeding to trial on all counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sentence was vacated in part, and the matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant parents appealed from a judgment entered by the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) terminating their parental rights to three children upon the petition of appellee Florida Department of Children and Family Services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The children were removed from their home when the mother brought the infant to the hospital with three broken bones consistent with shaken baby syndrome. The appellate court held that the infant's abuse constituted egregious conduct that threatened the health of the child, and that the parents were the only persons with the opportunity to inflict the injuries. However, there was not substantial evidence that the parents posed a substantial risk of significant harm to the two older children. The two older children had not been abandoned, abused, or neglected. They were well cared for and were closely bonded to their parents. The parents did not suffer from any physical or mental illness that would inhibit their proper care of the older children. Further, there was no indication the older children were aware of the infant's abuse, or that it had any psychological impact upon them. The finding that the termination of the parents' rights to the two older children was the least restrictive means of protecting them was clearly erroneous. Finally, the Department failed to show that termination of the parents' rights to the older children was in their manifest best interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed as to its termination of the parental rights to the youngest child. That portion of the judgment that terminated the parents' rights to the two older children was reversed. On remand, if the children were readjudicated dependent, the Department was directed to develop, and the trial court was directed to adopt, a case plan for the parents with a goal of reunification of the parents and their two older children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant arranged, over the Internet, to meet with a detective, who was posing as a 14-year-old boy, for the purpose of participating in illegal sexual activities. On appeal, defendant challenged the facial constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 847.0135(3) (2001) and also contended that the statute was invalid for failure to state a mens rea or scienter requirement. The appellate court ruled that even if ch. 847.0135(3) was considered a content-based restriction on constitutionally protected speech, it passed the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; test because it promoted a compelling state interest in protecting children from persons who solicited or lured them to commit illegal acts and was narrowly tailored to promote that interest, specifically limiting its prohibitions to communication intended to solicit or lure a child to commit illegal acts. The terms of the statute were sufficiently precise. The State's traverse adequately demonstrated a material dispute of the ultimate facts and that the Internet communications alone constituted a prima facie case of guilt under Fla. Stat. ch. 847.0135(3) (2001). Defendant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190(c)(4) motion to dismiss was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State of Florida sought certiorari review of a pretrial order by the Circuit Court for Pasco County (Florida), which required the State to provide defendant with notice of the aggravating factors it intended to prove in his capital murder trial and which required that the jury would be required to complete a specific interrogatory verdict form regarding the aggravating factors it found.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with first-degree murder. Defendant filed a pretrial motion to bar imposition of the death penalty. That motion was denied, but the State was ordered to provide the defense with adequate notice of the aggravating factors it intended to submit in support of the death penalty. The trial court also announced it would submit a special verdict form for the jury to fill out regarding the aggravating factors. The State appealed. The court found that requiring the State to provide advance notice of the aggravators was a departure from the essential requirements of law because the aggravating factors were limited to those listed in Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5) (1987). However, the State was not entitled to relief from the trial court's order regarding the verdict form. Florida law did not specifically prohibit a trial judge from using a special verdict form such as the one ordered, so the order did not depart from the essential requirements of law. The court certified the questions presented to the supreme court if that court wished to review the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court denied certiorari as to the portion of the order requiring the special verdict form, but the court granted certiorari as to the portion of the order requiring notice of aggravators. The court quashed that portion of the trial court's order and remanded. The court also certified questions to the state supreme court for its review if it chose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the guardian obtained the trial court's authorization to remove the nutrition and hydration tubes sustaining his wife, the Governor entered a stay and directed that the nutrition and hydration tubes be reinserted pursuant to 2003 Fla. Laws ch. 418. The guardian filed an action, inter alia, for a temporary injunction to prohibit the Governor from enforcing the statute. At no time during a hearing on the Governor's objection to the injunction did the Governor's counsel object to the trial court's jurisdiction or the guardian's failure to effect personal service. The appellate court held that by participating in the hearing and receiving material benefits thereof, the Governor submitted to the trial court's jurisdiction. Because the matter concerned the wife, who was in Pinellas County, the sword-wielder doctrine applied and Pinellas County was the proper venue for the litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During defendant's trial for sexual battery of his stepdaughter in the home, two other children testified that defendant had molested them when they spent the night at his home. Defendant objected, claiming that Fla. Stat. ch. 90.404(2)(b) (2001) was unconstitutional for violating both due process and constitutional ex post facto prohibitions and for permitting the introduction of irrelevant evidence. The trial court denied the motion and admitted the testimony. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 90.404(2)(b) (2001). The appellate court ruled that Fla. Stat. ch. 90.404(2)(b) (2001) was constitutional in cases where identity of the perpetrator was not in issue. Further, Fla. Stat. ch. 90.404(2)(b) (2001) did not violate the ex post facto clause because it was a procedural change. The trial court carefully and repeatedly instructed the jury as to how to use this evidence. It did not become a feature of the trial. The trial court did not err in admitting this evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant homeowners appealed from a summary judgment entered by the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) ruling that appellee Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association's (FWUA) rate increase did not have to be refunded, denying injunctive relief, and declaring that FWUA's rate increase was approved by appellee Florida Department of Insurance as a result of an arbitration, which had been affirmed in the Department's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The homeowners were aligned with the Department in asserting that arbitration was an improper means of deciding whether a rate hike in the FWUA's premiums should be allowed. The appellate court held that the Department had never given its approval of the rate hike, and that the FWUA's resort to arbitration as a means of raising rates was a material error made by the insurer under Fla. Stat. ch. 627.062(2)(g) (2003). The FWUA's rate increases had to be approved by the Department under the FWUA's Plan of Operation. The FWUA's resort to ch. 627.062(6) after the Department disapproved the request for rate increases was not authorized as the Plan of Operation required Department approval, not an arbitration award. The statutory amendment permitting rate arbitration was permissive, not mandatory, and did not alter the FWUA's Plan of Operation. Neither the FWUA's Plan of Operation nor the Department's rule had been amended to allow the FWUA to elect rate arbitration. As the Department had not acted, the trial court could not order the monetary relief sought by the homeowners. The homeowners were directed to seek any credits or refunds from the Department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's refusal to order refunds and the denial of injunctive relief was affirmed. The judgment and declaration were reversed insofar as it declared that construed the statute and the administrative code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant injured party appealed from a final judgment incorporating his settlement with appellee rental car lessor, entered by the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), in the injured party's suit against the lessor for vicarious liability, negligent entrustment, and a derivative claim on behalf of the injured party's minor children, after the negligent entrustment count was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured party argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 324.021(9) was unconstitutional as violative of his right of access to the courts. The appellate court noted that the state's highest court had approved of ch. 324.021(9)(b)1, which eliminated the vicarious liability of long-term lessors provided the lessee maintained certain levels of insurance coverage. Limiting the liability of one vicariously liable did not equate to denial of access to court as ch. 324.021(9)(b) did not limit the injured party's right to recover damages from the actual driver. Nor did it place a cap upon those damages. The statute also did not limit the injured party's right to a jury trial. Finally, the statute was rationally related to the legitimate legislative goal of shifting some of the responsibility for damages due to the operation of the motor vehicle from the owner of a motor vehicle to the driver of the vehicle, who was the actual tortfeasor, in short term leases. The statute did not discriminate against plaintiffs suffering the worst injuries as the damages cap applied to all plaintiffs and did not contain any arbitrary or oppressive classifications.</SPAN></P>

The husband joined appellee wife's parents as parties to the action, and filed a motion to vacate a prior order which gave custody of his daughter to his wife's parents. The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) denied the husband's motion, and the husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A husband and wife let their daughter live with the wife's parents and subsequently executed an agreement which gave the parents custody of their daughter.

Six months later, the wife filed an action seeking dissolution of her marriage. The husband joined the wife's parents as parties in the wife's action, and he sought an order vacating the order which gave his wife's parents custody of his child. However, the trial court denied his motion to vacate the order. The appellate court held that (1) the husband was entitled to have the order awarding custody of his daughter to his wife's parents modified if he showed that he was fit to have custody and that a change in custody would not be detrimental to the child; and (2) because there was no evidence that the husband waived his parental rights or that his parental rights were terminated, and the parties agreed that he was fit to have custody, the trial court should have heard evidence on the issue of whether a change in custody would have been detrimental to the child before it denied the husband's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Okaloosa County, Florida, entered judgments in two criminal cases against defendant. Defendant's appeals of the judgments were consolidated for appeal. In the second case, defendant's appellate counsel (1) moved, under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b)(2), to correct the trial court's sentencing errors, and (2) argued that the trial court erred in declaring defendant to be a sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the second case, counsel alleged that under Rule 3.800(b)(2), defendant's new split sentences for attempted lewd acts were excessive and that sex offender probation could not be imposed for grand theft. The trial court agreed and orally pronounced a corrected sentence. The appeals court found, however, that the trial court failed to enter, and on remand was required to enter, a written judgment and sentence to reflect the corrected oral pronouncement of sentence. The trial court had rejected defendant's argument that Fla. Stat. ch. 943.0435 (1998), which required the registration of &quot;sex offenders,&quot; was unconstitutional on the ground that it denied procedural due process. The appeals court had recently rejected that constitutional challenge under both Fla. Stat. chs. 775.21, 943.0435.  Fla. Stat. ch. 775.21 was the sexual predator law.  Fla. Stat. chs. 775.21, 943.0435 were indistinguishable, with respect to whether a hearing was required before the stigma of sexual offender status was imposed, as they both required an automatic determination if one of the enumerated crimes had been committed, registration for life, and criminal prosecution if a person failed to register.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeals court affirmed the appeal in the first case without discussion. The appeals court reversed only the sentencing judgment in the second case, and remanded the case for the entry of a corrected written sentencing judgment in accordance with its instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was convicted of trafficking in phenethylamines, appealed the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus by the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida). Since defendant claimed that the imposed mandatory minimum was an illegal sentence pursuant to Taylor, his petition was treated as a motion to correct an illegal sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted his sentence was illegal under Taylor. The appellate court held that even though defendant committed his offense within the Taylor window period. the Taylor case was inapplicable to defendant's claim for relief. In Taylor, the statutory changes contained in 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 were determined to be unconstitutional because the enactment of 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 violated the single subject rule contained in Florida's constitution. However, the offense of trafficking in phenethylamines and its mandatory minimum sentences were initially enacted into law by 2000 Fla. Laws ch. 320, which came afterwards. Therefore, the holding of Taylor did not apply. Because the mandatory minimum sentence imposed on defendant was a legal sentence, the trial court properly denied defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) that, inter alia, sentenced him to minimum mandatory terms for aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer; defendant claimed that he was forced to proceed pro se and that the mandatory sentences were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to robbery with a firearm, aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, and aggravated fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer at high speed or with wanton disregard. The appellate court held that while defendant's counsel was permitted to withdraw at the sentencing hearing, defendant was not required to proceed pro se. Rather, the trial court appointed the same attorney to act as standby counsel and the attorney functioned as defendant's attorney in all material respects at sentencing. Given the length of defendant's sentences, the minimum mandatory provisions had no impact on the term of his incarceration. However, because the minimum mandatory sentences imposed under Fla. Stat. ch. 784.07(2)(c) (2001) violated the single subject rule and the constitutional ex post facto clauses, the trial court was to delete them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of the denial of his two petitions for habeas corpus by the Circuit Court for DeSoto County (Florida), as the trial court did not consider them on the merits. In the first petition, he contended his continued detention was illegal and that the State failed to comply with time standards set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 394.9135 (2000). The second petition asserted his continued detention was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was due to be released. However, the State sought to have him civilly committed as a sexually violent predator. Thus, he was transferred to the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services to be detained in accordance with the provisions of the Jimmy Ryce Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 394.910 to 394.930 (2000). The appellate court held his constitutional argument had already been rejected by the United States Supreme Court and the Florida Supreme Court. His contention that the expert's reports were not legally sufficient to support his detention was not a proper basis for habeas relief. However, his contention that the State did not comply with the time requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 394.9135 did raise an issue that was properly the subject of a habeas petition. Therefore, the trial court should have considered that portion of his petition on the merits. However, he was not entitled to complete relief. Certain provisions did not apply to him. His assertion that he was not brought to trial within 30 days as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 394.916(1) could have entitled him to immediate release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dismissal of the second petition was affirmed. The dismissal of the first petition was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The matter was remanded for the trial court to consider the issue of whether appellant was brought to trial within 30 days and whether the State properly sought a continuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county appraiser sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida) which quashed the appraiser's ad valorem tax assessments of certain condominium units owned by appellee developer over a two-year period. The judgment declared that the condominium units were improperly assessed as timeshare property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A declaration of condominium governed a condominium complex and allowed for future creation of timeshare estates. The developer purchased 24 condominium units and began to market 16 units as timeshares. The trial court ordered the auditor to reassess all of the units as condominiums. The appellate court concluded that the assessment of the units as timeshares was proper after approval of the public offering statement (POS). Because the POS was not approved until November of the first year of assessments, and in light of the requirement that the assessment had to be made as of January 1 pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 192.042(1) (2002), the units were improperly assessed as timeshares for the first year, but not for the following year. The use of the condominiums as timeshares under Fla. Stat. ch. 193.011(2) (2002) was totally dependent on conversion of the units to timeshares. Moreover, the use of timeshares was not immediate and was speculative because it depended on obtaining approval of the POS. Thus, assessing the condominiums as timeshares as their highest and best use prior to approval of the POS was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed as to the assessments prior to January 1. It was reversed as to its order quashing the assessments after January 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant subcontractor challenged a decision of the Circuit Court for Lee County (Florida), which granted appellee property owner's motion to stay arbitration, ruled that the subcontractor's contract action and lien claim against appellee property owner, asserted as a cross-claim in litigation initiated by a third party, was based on an unenforceable contract under Fla. Stat. ch. 489.128 (2000), and discharged the subcontractor's lien.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During construction, a dispute arose regarding the work being performed by the subcontractor, and the owner refused to pay certain sums due under the contract. Although the owner invoked an arbitration clause in the contract, it subsequently learned that the subcontractor did not become licensed until two years after the construction began and more than a year and a half after it was terminated. Affirming, the court held that the subcontractor was not entitled to cure its unlicensed status pursuant to the prior version of Fla. Stat. ch. 489.128 (1999) where the cure provision of the statute was repealed by ch. 489.128 (2000). The trial court's application of ch. 489.128 (2000), rendering the contract unenforceable, was not a retroactive application because the subcontractor was on &quot;fair notice&quot; that the statutory provision for curing its unlicensed status was a matter of legislative grace that could be withdrawn by subsequent legislative action, the right the subcontractor had under ch. 489.128 (1999) was not a vested right, and once ch. 498.128 (2000) became effective, the opportunity previously afforded to the subcontractor to cure its unlicensed status was properly cut off.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's order barring the subcontractor's claims against the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty under a plea bargain to two counts of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 784.07(2)(c). The Circuit Court for Orange County, Florida, imposed mandatory minimum sentences. Defendant appealed, alleging that retroactive application of a statutory amendment imposing mandatory minimum sentences violated the U.S. and Florida Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The offenses at issue were committed before the effective date of 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 209, which purported to amend Fla. Stat. ch. 784.07(2)(c) (1997) to require imposition of a mandatory minimum prison term. 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 209 was passed in response to state appellate courts having found 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188, which also provided for such sentences, to be unconstitutional for violating the single subject rule imposed by Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The instant court had held in Hersey v. State, 831 So. 2d 679 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002), that 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 209 could be applied retroactively, but it receded from that decision. Chapter 209 was never a part of Florida law because its unconstitutional enactment rendered it void ab initio. Moreover, 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 effected a substantive change in the law to defendant's detriment. That defendant had entered into a plea agreement was immaterial; imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence that was not authorized by statute was an illegal sentence, and a defendant could not be bound by an agreement to accept an illegal sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the Circuit Court for Leon County held that the Opportunity Scholarship Program, Fla. Stat. ch. 229.0537 (1999), was unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The trial court required appellants, state officials and others, to post a bond or letter of credit to secure reimbursement of funds lost to the school districts while the case was appealed. Appellants sought removal of the bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under Fla. R. App. P. 9.310(b)(2), the state, any public officer in an official capacity, board, commission, or other public body was allowed an automatic stay pending review without the necessity of posting a bond. The Florida Supreme Court had interpreted the rule as allowing trial and appellate courts the discretion to require governmental entities to post supersedeas bonds in suits where the judgment concerned operational-level functions but found that no authority existed to lawfully require such bonds in planning-level governmental functions. The appellate court concluded that the Florida Legislature's enactment of the Opportunity Scholarship Program was clearly a planning-level governmental function that did not require a bond for review of the trial court's declaration that it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court granted appellants' motion to review the trial court's orders conditioning the automatic stay with the posting of a bond and held that the automatic stay would remain in effect pending review without appellants posting a bond or letter of credit as required by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee Florida Public Employees Relations Commission (PERC) dismissed appellant union's petitions to amend certification on the basis that the union's exception that Fla. Stat. ch. 447.203(2) (2002) was not controlling was meritless and determined that the statute clearly and unambiguously set forth that the Boards of Trustees were deemed the public employers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Florida Legislature passed a law abolishing the Florida Board of Regents, effective July 1, 2001, and established new criteria for local Boards of Trustees at each state university. The law provided that the individual boards would be the public employer with respect to all public employees of the respective state university. Thereafter, the voters of Florida approved a constitutional amendment on the issue. On appeal, the union argued that the PERC erred by designating the university Boards of Trustees as the public employers of their respective universities. The appellate court noted that, regardless of the PERC's reliance on Fla. Stat. ch. 447.203(2) (2002) in denying the union's petitions, it reached the correct result because the Board of Governors' action of designating the Boards of Trustees as the public employers of their respective universities constituted a legitimate exercise of constitutional authority. The appellate court held that, as the Board of Governors, pursuant to the powers bestowed upon it by the voters of Florida, designated the Boards of Trustees as the public employers of their respective universities, the PERC's order would not be disturbed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) denying his motion to correct illegal sentence filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed the three-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(f)(1)(a) (1999) was illegal based on Taylor, which found that 1999 Fla. Laws 188, providing for the imposition of mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain drug offenses, was unconstitutional. However, the trial court found Taylor did not apply retroactively, because neither the U.S. Supreme Court nor the Florida Supreme Court had adopted the change of law. The appellate court found this reasoning erroneous. The law drew a distinction between a void law and one that was merely voidable. Thus, based on Green and Taylor, 1999 Fla. Laws 188 was illegally enacted and void ab initio. Pursuant to Green, if defendant committed the offense within the Taylor window, the trial court was required to resentence him under the 1997 version of ch. 893.135(1)(f)(1)(a). The legislature provided for the retroactive application of each reenactment to July 1, 1999, the effective date of 1999 Fla. Laws 188. The trial court relied on Callaway, but Calloway and Witt had no application when an appellate court determined a statute was never legally enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and remanded, with instructions. If, as he alleged in his motion, defendant committed the offense of trafficking in methamphetamine within the proper window, the trial court was to resentence him. Conflict was certified with the Fourth and Fifth District cases with which the court previously disagreed.</SPAN></P>

After the State nolle prossed the charges, the arrestees sued the sheriff for false arrest. The appellate court held that the sheriff's interpretation of what was lewd was at least arguable, and not &quot;cockeyed.&quot; At the time the arrests occurred, the sheriff had probable cause to arrest the arrestees for remaining in a place for the purposes of prostitution, lewdness, or assignation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a father and his daughter, filed a 12-count complaint against defendants, a doctor and a health center, alleging claims for negligence and for intentional torts. The Circuit Court of Alachua County (Florida) dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claims derived from an alleged obligation of defendants to notify the father of the intent to perform an abortion on his daughter in September 1997, when she was 14 years old, and to obtain his authorization for the procedure. The complaint also averred that the former minor had a right to disavow her consent, upon attaining the age of majority, and then to sue for damages occasioned by the procedure. The appellate court held that the claims were completely foreclosed by the Florida Supreme Court's previous ruling that a minor (of any age if such minor could become pregnant) had the constitutional right to an abortion without the parents' knowledge or consent, pursuant to the privacy provision of Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23. A minor's right to privacy superseded parental rights in the context of abortion. In light of the wide authority that the State granted an unwed minor to make life-or-death decisions concerning herself or an existing child without parental consent, there did not seem to be a special compelling interest on the part of the state under Florida law in protecting the minor only where abortion was concerned.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(j)(2)(a) (2000). Defendant claimed that the three-year mandatory minimum sentence was illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188, which provided for the imposition of mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain drug offenses, was found to be unconstitutional because it violated the single subject rule of the Florida Constitution. Defendant claimed that because his offense occurred in February 2002, within the window period, his mandatory minimum sentence was illegal. The appellate court held that trafficking in MDMA was not among the drug offenses listed in chapter ch. 188 and did not become a statutory offense until 2000 Fla. Laws ch. 320 took effect on October 1, 2000 and imposed mandatory minimum sentences for the new drug offenses created by that amendment. As a result, defendant's sentence was legal and the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(j)(2)(a) (2000) to the mandatory minimum prison sentence for trafficking in MDMA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the authority granted to it by Fla. Stat. ch. 985.227(1)(b), the State elected to prosecute defendant as an adult, even though the burglary he was charged with was committed when defendant was 16 years old. Defendant moved to dismiss the information on the ground that ch. 985.227(1)(b) and Fla. Stat. ch. 985.227(4) were unconstitutional. Defendant argued that those statutes violated the separation of powers doctrine and deprived him of the equal protection of the laws. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant pled no contest in exchange for one year of probation and a withhold of adjudication. He reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss as part of his plea bargain agreement. The court held that although the direct file statute had been amended many times over the years, the case of State v. Cain, 381 So. 2d 1361 (Fla. 1980) remained dispositive and mandated the rejection of defendant's claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant inmate was convicted of first-degree murder, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal. Seventeen years later, he filed a motion for postconviction DNA testing under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.853, alleging that the test results would prove that he was not the source of the semen found in the victim's body. The Circuit Court of Bay County, Florida, denied the motion, and the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate admitted stabbing the victim, but denied committing anal intercourse. He claimed that the victim was making forcible sexual advances and that he killed him in self defense. The State used the evidence that the victim had semen in his rectum to support its theory of premeditation and to refute the inmate's self defense claim; however, at trial the semen could not be positively identified as the inmate's. The trial court held that the inmate was not entitled to a DNA test since he admitted fatally stabbing the victim. The supreme court noted that the inmate qualified for a postconviction DNA test under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.853, but not under Fla. Stat. ch. 925.11(2)(a) (2003), which allowed such a test only to resolve a mistaken identity claim. The supreme court rejected the State's claim that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.853 violated the separation of powers provision of Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. The decision to grant a new trial in a criminal case was unquestionably within the province of the courts, and the legislature's failure to define the circumstances under which a new trial could be granted was an apparent recognition of the fact that the issue was one for the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded. On remand, the trial court could take any action authorized by the applicable rule of criminal procedure to determine whether the inmate's allegations were true and, if so, whether he was entitled to DNA testing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), which found him guilty of computer pornography and child exploitation in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 847.0135(3). Defendant was sentenced to community control and placed on sex offender probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer went on-line posing as a 15-year-old boy. He was contacted by defendant. Defendant arranged a meeting so the two could have sex. On appeal, defendant argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 847.0135 was unconstitutionally overbroad, vague, and an impermissible content-based regulation in violation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The appellate court concluded that it was the speech itself that translated into the criminal conduct. Defendant's speech amounted to seduction, solicitation, and enticement of a child to commit a crime that was prohibited. Thus, defendant's overbreadth argument was unpersuasive as well as his position that the statute was an impermissible content-based regulation. Also, the statute was not overbroad for failing to define the term child because the statute specifically pointed to other chapters of the Florida Statutes where the victim was defined by age. Finally, the State proved the elements of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The fact that the only potential victim was an undercover officer did not preclude a conviction because the evidence indicated that the officer clearly portrayed himself as a 15-year-old boy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.

While defendant might have been able to resist a seizure by officers arising from conduct outside of school in the general public, she could not do so at a school function where her resistance itself disrupted the event.

Laws ch. 418 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the guardian's ward.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Governor sought to depose the guardian's relatives, medical experts, and the person who resided with the guardian. The guardian argued that any facts attested to by the witnesses were irrelevant and that all of the relevant facts were either adjudicated in the guardianship proceeding or were stipulated to by the parties. The appellate court held that some facts as to the guardian's claims that the statute was an unconstitutional bill of attainder and an invalid special law might not have been considered in the guardianship proceeding such as those pertaining to the enactment of the statute and its effect on the ward. The trial court erred in entering the protective order without resolving the parties' arguments as to the propriety of inquiry into the statute's impact on the ward and other factually based aspects of the constitutional challenge, and as to the propriety of further inquiry into facts adjudicated in the guardianship proceeding. Thus, the protective order lacked good cause. The error was not remediable on appeal as there was no way to determine how the denial of the right to depose alleged material witnesses would have affected the outcome of the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), convicted defendant of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. His counsel acknowledged that the motion, which was denied before trial, was not renewed during trial, and was therefore waived. But, a recent statutory amendment under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.104(1)(b) (2003) purported to eliminate the need to renew the objection at trial. Even if this statute was procedural, the instant court recommended that it be adopted as a rule. Because most pretrial denials of motions to suppress were based on findings of fact, the vast majority of those rulings, when considered on the merits, were affirmed on appeal. If those cases could be decided on direct appeal, it would eliminate the need for post-conviction proceedings on that issue. The new statute did not preclude a party from asking the court to reconsider the prior ruling at trial, it only eliminated the necessity of having to make a perfunctory renewal of the objection. Concluding that there was competent substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that the firearm was not obtained as the result of an illegal search and seizure, defendant's conviction was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, an animal rights foundation and an individual, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida), which entered a non-final order granting a temporary injunction to appellees, a timeshare developer and its president, and restricted appellants' protest activities with respect to appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer hired an exotic animal performance to draw potential buyers for resort timeshares. The developer and its president sued appellants based on their animal rights protest activities. Appellants picketed and circulated leaflets claiming that the president abused animals. The trial court granted appellees a temporary injunction. On appeal, the court held that the evidence failed to prove that appellees were entitled to receive a temporary injunction. Further, portions of the injunction violated appellants' First Amendment rights. As to the injunction provisions regulating appellants' right to picket, the regulations were content-neutral; however, the restrictions, which limited amplification, number of picketers, and videotaping, burdened more speech than was necessary to protect any valid public interest. The prohibitions against publishing particular statements about appellees were content-based and thereby subject to strict scrutiny as prior restraints. There was no compelling state interest that was met by the injunction terms and they violated appellants' First Amendment rights. The subject speech was not commercial speech, but was purely of a political nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) granted appellee class members injunctive relief in their lawsuit against appellant city attacking the validity of the city's vehicle impoundment ordinance, Miami, Fla., Code &sect;&sect; 42-120 through 42-125 (1997). The city appealed, and some of the class members cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both parties challenged the judgment entered. The city contended that the trial court erred in holding that its vehicle impoundment ordinance unconstitutionally conflicted with the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 932.703(6)(a) (2002), in its treatment of innocent vehicle owners, and erred in holding that the notice requirements of the ordinance unconstitutionally conflicted with the Act. The class members argued that the Act pre-empted the ordinance. The appeals court agreed with the class members. While the Act allowed forfeiture in similar circumstances to the ones outlined in the ordinance, it provided rights which were not provided for in the ordinance. Also, the Act directly pre-empted the ordinance because it provided for a comprehensive procedure for forfeiture of property. Finally, the taking of a vehicle under the ordinance was a forfeiture because such taking was temporary. Even if a vehicle owner paid the penalty and got the vehicle back, the owner suffered a permanent loss of the amount paid as a penalty. If the owner did not prevail or pay the penalty, then the vehicle faced a sale, leaving the owner permanently deprived of his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order granting injunctive relief enjoining the city from enforcing its ordinance was affirmed. That part of the order finding the ordinance was enforceable in part with respect to owners who were drivers or passengers of a vehicle that was seized was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) that granted defendants' motion to dismiss the information, and declared Florida's Medicaid Provider Fraud Statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 409.920(2)(e) (2000), unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State alleged that the defendants violated the &quot;anti-kickback&quot; provision of Florida's Medicaid Provider Fraud Statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 409.920(2)(e) (2000), by paying drivers, who were alleged to be employed by or associated with three corporate entities that were engaged in the business of providing dental services to children, a per head fee or commission for the solicitation and transportation of Medicaid eligible children to dental facilities for treatment. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information arguing, among other things, that payment of wages by a Medicaid provider to its employees was expressly protected by federal Medicaid statutes and regulations. The trial court applied implied conflict preemption analysis and found that Fla. Stat. ch. 409.920(2)(e) was unconstitutional. Additionally, the trial court found that the mens rea requirement in Fla. Stat. ch. 409.920(1)(d) was preempted by federal law, and also unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the trial court properly found that there was implied conflict preemption and declared the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 400, and punitive damages. The successor cross-appealed the denial of its motion for attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The daughter commenced the action against the original facility in her guardian capacity, but after her mother's death, she continued the action as personal representative and joined the successor. The original facility settled with the daughter. The trial court entered summary judgment for the successor on the Fla. Stat. ch. 400 claims, directed a verdict against the daughter for punitive damages, and the jury returned a verdict on the negligence claims for the successor. On appeal by the daughter, the court found that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the successor to peremptorily challenge the only two African-American venirepersons, as it was clear under the Melbourne factors that at least one person was stricken for pretextual reasons. The court found that denial of attorney's fees to the successor was proper, as was the refusal to include the original facility on the verdict form. Although the mother died prior to the joinder of the successor, the court found that the legislative intent of whether the statutory action survived was best determined by using the 2001 version of Fla. Stat. ch. 400.023. A directed verdict on punitive damages was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and ordered that the daughter receive a new trial. The court certified a conflict with a sister court's decision in another case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three of appellant's issues were addressed: his commitment violated his contractual rights with the State under his previous plea agreement; the provision of the Ryce Act permitting the admission of hearsay evidence was unconstitutional on various grounds; and the instructions given by the trial court were inadequate. Appellant raised no meritorious issues. Any rights appellant had under his plea agreement pertained only to the criminal sanctions against him. Any such rights were totally irrelevant to the separate civil proceedings against him under the Ryce Act. Admission of hearsay evidence did not violate appellant's right to confrontation as those provisions under the Florida and U.S. Constitutions were expressly limited to &quot;criminal prosecutions,&quot; and Fla. Stat. ch. 394.9155(5) (2000) did not impermissibly invade the authority vested by Fla. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), which convicted him of, and sentenced him for, resisting an officer without violence, fleeing or attempting to elude a law enforcement officer, unlawful display of authorized indicia of law enforcement authority in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 843.085, and reckless driving. Before the court was a motion for rehearing and clarification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was observed by police driving recklessly on a motorcycle over 100 miles per hour while he was wearing a shirt with the word &quot;POLICE&quot; written on the front and back. Reversing in part, the court held that defendant's conviction for the unlawful display of authorized indicia of law enforcement authority pursuant to ch. 843.085(1) should be vacated because the statute was impermissibly content-based, overbroad, and proscribed conduct protected by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 4 and 9 and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. However, defendant's remaining convictions were affirmed because (1) although the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted the State to elicit testimony from an officer about the behavior of a common class of criminals, the error was harmless; (2) the allegedly inflammatory statements of the prosecutor in closing arguments were made in response to a defense argument, and, thus, the claimed error was invited; and (3) although defendant's response to an officer as to why he did not stop the motorcycle should have been suppressed because it was the product of direct custodial interrogation, the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted rehearing and clarification, withdrew its previous opinion, and substituted this opinion, in which it reversed and vacated defendant's conviction and sentence for the unlawful display of authorized indicia of law enforcement authority but affirmed his convictions and sentences on the remaining counts. The court also certified a conflict with another district's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled no contest to five misdemeanor counts: battery, stalking, and several violations of a previously entered injunction protecting against repeat violence. Defendant was placed on probation. The State filed an affidavit of violation of probation which alleged that defendant engaged in stalking his victim by harassment. Defendant appealed the order of the Circuit Court of Miami-Dade County (Florida), which revoked his probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that because he did not have any direct or indirect contact with the victim, the trial court abused its discretion by finding him guilty of stalking. The appellate court concluded that the stalking statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 784.048 (2001), did not require contact, direct or indirect, as a part of the offense of stalking. Defendant also argued that the trial court's application of the stalking statute to him was a due process violation, as nothing in the statute gave notice that his behavior would be considered a violation of the statute. The appellate court concluded that defendant's constitutional contentions had previously been rejected. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court had no jurisdiction to revoke the three consecutive probation terms that had not yet commenced. However, none of defendant's four consecutive probationary periods had expired prior to the process of revocation having been set in motion. In addition, because the trial court was free to revoke probation at any time for misconduct that demonstrated defendant's unfitness for probation, it was permissible to revoke the consecutive terms which had not yet commenced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration, sought review of an order of the Department of Administrative Hearings (Florida), which awarded appellee healthcare limited partnership all of its attorney's fees in the partnership's action that successfully challenged the Agency's non-rule policy. At issue, in part, was Fla. Stat. ch. 120.595(4) (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The partnership operated several nursing home facilities. The Agency filed an administrative complaint seeking to revoke the licenses of the nursing homes, relying on a then-new statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 400.121(3) (2001). The partnership took the position that the Agency's action was illegal and devised a multi-pronged strategy to preserve the licenses. An administrative law judge (ALJ) ultimately determined that the Agency's actions violated Fla. Stat. ch. 120.54(1)(a) (2000), which generally provided that any agency statement defined as a rule had to be adopted by the Administrative Procedure Act's rulemaking procedure as soon as feasible. The partnership then sought its attorney's fees, not only for the successful challenge to the non-rule policy, but for all of the activities engaged in by its counsel. The ALJ awarded the partnership all of the fees requested. On appeal, the court held that, in light of the strict construction to be applied to attorney's fee statutes such as Fla. Stat. ch. 120.595(4) (2001), it was unable to uphold the award beyond fees that were incurred in the non-rule challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the decision below and remanded the case. On remand, the ALJ was to determine what fees were recoverable under the court's reading of the statute. The ALJ was to exclude any fees expended to prove the amount, as opposed to the entitlement, of attorney's fees, as well as any fees incurred in proving entitlement to attorney's fees for efforts beyond the challenge. The costs were to bear a relationship to the non-rule challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants sought review of the final judgment of the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida), which declared Brevard County, Fla., Home Rule Charter &sect; 5.4 to be inconsistent with Fla. Stat. chs. 129, 200, and therefore violative of Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(g).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the issue was whether the tax cap provision contained in Brevard County, Fla., Home Rule Charter &sect; 5.4 was inconsistent with Florida law governing the annual consideration and adoption of budgets and millage rates by county commissions. The appellate court found that the trial court correctly concluded that the charter provision was unconstitutional as being in conflict with Fla. Stat. chs. 129, 200, which set forth the statutory framework by which counties were to establish budgets and millage rates. Nothing in Fla. Stat. ch. 129 regarding the establishment of a budget, or in Fla. Stat. ch. 200 regarding the establishment of a millage rate, provided for a cap on the budget that could be overridden by a super-majority vote of county commissioners. To impose such a cap was contrary to the scheme established by the legislature. In addition, the charter provision providing for a referendum to override the ad valorem revenue cap in the event additional ad valorem revenues were deemed necessary by the county commission directly violated Fla. Stat. ch. 125.01(1)(r), which provided, inter alia, that no referendum was required for the levy by a county of ad valorem taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One child was sheltered and adjudicated dependent, based on allegations that the mother's step-child was physically abused and died while in her care. The mother was convicted of manslaughter and child abuse for the step-child's death. After the mother's incarceration ended, she was offered a case plan. A neuropsychological study indicated that the mother was capable of reestablishing a relationship with her child. The mother had another child who was sheltered due to the step-child's death, and upon the mother's denial of the petition for adjudication of dependency as to that child, she was granted supervised visitation. The department sought to terminate her rights. The trial court terminated her rights, finding that she did not take responsibility for the step-child's death, had anger-management problems, and did not substantially complete the case plan. On appeal, the court concluded that the department failed to present clear and convincing evidence to support the termination decision. The case plan was complete except for counseling, which was not due to the mother's fault. The other grounds asserted were inadequate to support termination under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.806 (2002).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the matter for continuation of the children's dependency status.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee Florida Department of Children and Families filed a petition for dependency in the Circuit Court for Putnam County (Florida). Appellant father, through counsel, denied the petition for dependency, while the mother consented to the petition. The trial court adjudicated the father's two children to be dependent. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At an arraignment hearing, the trial court accepted the mother's consent to and the father's denial to the petition, and withheld adjudication of dependency. A week prior to the disposition hearing, the trial court entered a written order from the earlier arraignment hearing. The written order stated that based on the mother's consent, the court found the children to be dependent within the intent and meaning of Fla. Stat. ch. 39.01(14)(a) (2003). Thus, the written order did not withhold adjudication of dependency, as was agreed at the arraignment hearing. The father argued that the trial court's written order of dependency did not conform to the court's oral pronouncement. He also contended that ch. 39.01(14)(a) was not intended to allow children to be found dependent when the allegations were against only one parent and there existed another fit non-offending parent willing to assume custody. On appeal, the court remanded the matter to the trial court to the extent that the order needed clarification. As a non-offending parent, the father was entitled to placement at disposition unless the placement was shown to endanger the children. Fla. Stat. ch. 39.521 (2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded with instructions to conform the written order to the court's oral pronouncement. On remand, the father was free to question the constitutionality of the statute, as applied to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by designating him a prison releasee reoffender under the Florida Prison Releasee Reoffender Act, specifically Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(9)(a)(3), because he was convicted of a capital offense rather than a life felony. The appellate court held that the offense could be treated as non-capital for the purpose of applying ch. 775.082(9)(a). It was inconceivable that the legislature did not intend capital sexual battery, as a felony punishable by life, to fall within the scope of the Act. The appellate court also rejected defendant's contention that his sentence violated the federal and state constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. Merely because defendant's sentence was mandatory and severe, it did not follow that it violated the Eighth Amendment. The legislature's imposition of a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole for the offense was not out of sync with Florida's historic treatment of sexual battery of a child. Further, the treatment of the crime of capital sexual battery in other jurisdictions was not so out of line as to render the punishment under Florida law unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that she had made substantial changes since her parental rights to her other children were terminated due to child abuse, which resulted in the death of her baby. The appellate court held she failed to show that the conduct that led to termination of parental rights to her other children could not serve as a predictor of her conduct with the instant child. The mother was unemployed; she was evicted from one place; she was facing criminal proceedings; and she entered into another relationship with an abusive, substance-abusing man even after he was released from incarceration and the child was removed from her. The mother's claim that it was the DCF's fault that she did not pay child support was rejected, as there was no evidence that the DCF interfered with her employment. Going to church and feeling pain from the loss of her children were not examples of substantial changes that would support any conclusion other than the one reached by the trial court.

Stat. ch. 73.092(1) (1995) to appellee landowner in an eminent domain action after three potential landowners apportioned a stipulated final judgment, jointly awarded all three potential landowners, among themselves.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county argued that if the offer of judgment was a written offer, the landowner was not entitled to attorney's fees under ch. 73.092(1), as the benefit to the landowner was zero. The appellate court held that the offer of judgment was a written offer. The landowner received $ 7,666 from the stipulated final judgment, but the record did not reflect how much of the offer was intended for the landowner. As the benefits to the landowner were impossible to ascertain, the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the landowner attorney's fees under ch. 73.092(1). Instead, the trial court should have based its attorney's fee award on ch. 73.092(2), which provided factors for consideration in assessing attorney's fees. While a plain language reading of that subsection suggested that it was inapplicable, as the underlying action was not a supplemental proceeding, the appellate court had held that ch. 73.092(2) governed awards of attorney's fees in all eminent domain proceedings in which the condemning authority failed to make a written offer to settle the claim or which otherwise could not be resolved using the benefits analysis in ch. 73.092(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order was reversed. The case was remanded for reconsideration of the attorney's fees issue. On remand, the landowner was not limited to the amount of fees requested in her motion for attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner Governor of the State of Florida filed a petition for a writ of prohibition to the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida), challenging the trial court's denial of the Governor's motion to disqualify the trial judge from presiding over further proceedings in connection with the challenge to the constitutionality of 2003 Fla. Laws ch. 418 brought by respondent husband, as guardian of his wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Governor argued that the trial judge was biased as he characterized ch. 418 as presumptively unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the statement announced the standard by which the trial judge believed the constitutionality of the statute was to be measured. The appellate court had held that the courts were attempting to honor the wife's constitutional right of privacy as it affected her medical decisions, and a legislative act impinging on the right of privacy was presumptively unconstitutional unless proved valid by the State. The trial judge's reference to the infringement upon the wife's rights was part of his legal analysis and was made in support of his decision to lift the automatic stay. The Governor's claim that the trial judge had prejudged the case by concluding that the wife's right of privacy was invaded by the legislation, in view of legal precedent so holding, did not show bias. Finally, the trial judge did not signal his predisposition to rule against the Governor by consulting notes when he ruled. The Governor was able to fully argue his position, and the trial judge took a recess after the arguments were concluded to consider his decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition for writ of prohibition was denied with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother appealed from an order entered by the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) transferring primary residential custody of her eight-year-old son to appellee father, and from a temporary order awarding custody to intervenor maternal grandmother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that the father failed to meet his burden under the Gibbs test. The appellate court held that the trial court abused its discretion in modifying custody. The circumstances had not substantially changed since the original custody order was entered. The mother and her son were living with the maternal grandmother when the original order was entered. The only proof as to a change in circumstances was evidence of positive changes in the mother's financial stability and in her receipt of treatment for her drug problem. The father failed to prove that his son had witnessed domestic violence to his mother. Second, the best interests of the child were not clearly served by a custody change. The trial court assumed, without evidence to support its assumption, that continuing to reside with the mother would be detrimental to the child. The trial court failed to reference any ascertainable indication that the child was suffering any harm as required by Jacoby and its progeny. The child was performing well in school, enjoyed normal activities, was close to his half-sister, and appeared to be surrounded by love.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order modifying custody and the temporary order awarding custody to the maternal grandmother and requiring the mother to have supervised visitation were reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court to enter an order vacating the order granting the father's petition to modify custody and reaffirming the mother's custody as established in the final judgment of dissolution of marriage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the denial by the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), of his motion to declare Fla. Stat. ch. 943.0435 (2002), the sexual offender statute, unconstitutional, following his entry into a negotiated plea, which included both youthful offender and sex offender probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that ch. 943.0435 violated his procedural due process and privacy rights. The appellate court joined other appellate courts' decisions and held that the statute was constitutional. Further, the more restrictive sexual predator statute had withstood a similar constitutional challenge. Defendant did not preserve for appeal his claim that the sexual offender statute could not be applied to him because he was sentenced as a juvenile under the youthful offender statute as defendant did not file a timely motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Further, the youthful offender sentence was an adult sentence. Defendant's argument that because Fla. Stat. ch. 944.607(9) (2002) provided for the offender to register according to Fla. Stat. ch. 943.0435(3) (2002), and that section did not require registration until 48 hours after being released from supervision, defendant should not have to register until he was released from probation, was rejected. Such an interpretation ignored the plain language of the statutes and the clear intent of the legislature. The reference to &quot;release&quot; in ch. 943.0435(3) was for offenders serving prison time, not for those on probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction by the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), of first-degree murder and the resulting mandatory sentence to life in prison, challenging the denial of his post-trial request for a competency hearing, and challenging the trial court's failure to order, sua sponte, a pre-trial competency evaluation. Defendant also challenged the denial of his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the refusal to order a competency hearing violated his due process rights. The appellate court held that due to defendant's extremely young age and lack of previous exposure to the judicial system, a competency evaluation was constitutionally mandated to determine whether defendant had sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether he had a rational, as well as factual, understanding of the proceedings against him. A competency evaluation was required, particularly due to the complexity of the legal proceedings and the fact that defendant was denied the protection afforded children 14 and older under Fla. Stat. ch. 985.226(2). The plea colloquy was not adequate to evaluate competency given defendant's age, immaturity, his nine or 10-year-old mental age, and the complexity of the proceedings. The trial court's reasoning was insufficient to override the testimony regarding defendant's reduced mental functioning, his possible inability to understand the charges and decisions to be made, the potential penalty, and the professional opinion that a competency evaluation and hearing was necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction was reversed and the case was remanded. Upon remand, defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Leon County Circuit Court (Florida) found that only a portion of Fla. Stat. ch. 193.016 was unconstitutional. Both appellant, the Department of Revenue, and appellees, county appraisers and two individual litigants, sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue presented was whether Fla. Stat. ch. 193.016 violated the uniform valuation requirement of Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4. The appeals court first held that the statute prescribed a valuation methodology applicable to only a special class of tangible personal property. While the trial court was correct that the first sentence of the statute merely required the property appraiser to consider the prior year tangible personal property assessment reduction made by the value adjustment board, the mandated consideration was an essential component of the valuation methodology for this special class of property. Second, the legislature was authorized to add to or modify to the list of factors found in the statute to be considered by the property appraiser when determining valuations for all types of property. However, except in circumstances specified in Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, and not present in the instant case, it could not provide additional or different factors which were applicable to only a limited class of property. Because this was the effect of both sentences of the statute, it violated the Florida constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment that found the second sentence of the statute was unconstitutional was affirmed, but that part of the judgment which held the first sentence was not constitutional was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court declared facially unconstitutional 1997 Fla. Laws ch. 197, &sect; 2, creating Fla.

VII, &sect; 3(a). For the same reason, the trial court also declared facially invalid a portion of 1997 Fla. Laws ch. 197(3), which amended Fla. Stat. ch. 196.012, to provide that a municipality's provision of two-way telecommunications services to the public did not constitute an exempt use for ad valorem tax purposes unless the services complied with certain conditions therein specified. On appeal, the court believed that the property in question was being used by the city for a municipal purpose and the legislature's attempt to condition the provision of these municipal services on the payment of an amount equal to any ad valorem tax liability was in direct conflict with Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(a). The court also found the argument that the provisions of the act merely outlined a condition for the provision of telecommunication services was unpersuasive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment entered, arguing that the Florida Sexual Predator Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.21 (2000), violated separation of powers and procedural due process requirements. The appeals court held that defendant's conviction was the only material fact necessary for the imposition of the Act. He did not challenge the hearing afforded on his plea nor the opportunity allowed to contest his conviction. Second, he was not entitled to a separate hearing to prove that he did not pose a danger or threat to society. Third, the only material fact for imposition of the employment restrictions was defendant's conviction of an offense involving a minor. Fourth, the presumption of prospective application did not apply where the legislature clearly stated an intent that the Act apply retroactively. Finally, the following question was certified as one of great importance: whether the retroactive application of the permanent employment restrictions of Fla. Stat. ch. 775.21(10)(b) (2000) to a defendant convicted and qualified as a sexual predator, without a separate hearing on whether such defendant constituted a danger or threat to public safety, violated procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate pled no contest to trafficking in cocaine in excess of 200 grams, and received a seven-year mandatory minimum sentence. He brought a motion to correct an illegal sentence, arguing that amendments to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135 (1999) violated the single subject provision of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The Circuit Court, Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Martin County, Florida, denied the motion, and the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued that the amendment at issue, 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188, violated the single subject provision of Florida's Constitution because it included unrelated provisions. The supreme court initially held that retroactive application of a cure to a single subject violation was contrary to the Ex Post Facto Clauses of both the United States and Florida Constitutions, and receded from its published opinions relying on Hersey v. State, 831 So. 2d 679 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002). The title of ch. 188 -- &quot;An act relating to sentencing&quot; -- was not defective or misleading, as it fully informed of the provisions of the law. Noting that the single subject constitutional provision had to be liberally construed, the supreme court held that ch. 188 was constitutional. It was not an example of legislative logrolling. There was no suggestion that any of the provisions of the law would not have passed had they been introduced in separate bills. All of its provisions dealt with criminal law, were all logically related, and furthered the purpose of the law, which was to protect the public from serious felony offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court affirmed the judgment of the trial court denying the inmate's motion to correct an illegal sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), which convicted him of organized scheme to defraud and grand theft greater than $ 20,000 and less than $ 100,000 and which sentenced him to concurrent 42.5 month sentences on both convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant worked for a travel agency, and the agency became aware that defendant had booked some vacation packages without the authority to do so and terminated defendant. Defendant's records were then audited, resulting in the criminal charges against him. On appeal, the court found error only as to the double jeopardy issue, finding that the two crimes shared common elements and the State conceded the violation. The court held, however, that the organized scheme to defraud conviction and defendant's sentence were proper. The court determined that evidence of prior acts of defendant was properly admitted under the Williams rule to show that defendant engaged in a plan to defraud employers because at both this job and a prior job, defendant had used discount coupons that altered the cost of airline tickets and caused the travel agencies to be charged for any unaccounted airfare. The court also held that defendant's sentence was not in error because although the departure was based on the 1995 sentencing guidelines, which had been held unconstitutional in Heggs, the economic motive reason cited by the trial court was applicable under both the 1994 and 1995 sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the grand theft conviction and sentence and remanded for discharge, and it affirmed the organized scheme to defraud conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent was stopped by police for driving a stolen vehicle and he identified himself by a false name and signed traffic citations by that name. He was charged with forgery in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 831.01 (2002), and the trial court granted respondent's motion in limine to exclude the forged traffic citations pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.650(9) (2002) and Dixon. The trial court indicated that it was bound by the case law precedent, which appeared to be the only case directly on point. On rehearing of the State's petition for writ of certiorari, the court found that Fla. Stat. ch. 316.650(9) was unambiguous and did not provide any exceptions for the admissibility of traffic citations. Following principles of statutory interpretation, the court felt bound by the prior determination and by the statutory language. Accordingly, it found that the forged traffic citations were not admissible. There was nothing in ch. 316.650(9) which was unconstitutional or that violated clearly established law, and accordingly, the certiorari review would not have yielded a different result. The court certified a question to the supreme court on the admissibility of such citations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida), which convicted her of trafficking in methamphetamine and imposed a sentence of a minimum mandatory term of seven years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was sentenced for conviction of trafficking in methamphetamine pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(l)(f)(l)(b) (1999). During the pendency of the appeal, she filed a motion to correct sentence under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b)(2), based on her assertion that her sentence was improper pursuant to Taylor v. State, as the sentencing statute had been declared unconstitutional and the newly enacted provision could not be applied retroactively. The court noted that since appellant's offense was committed during the &quot;Taylor window period,&quot; her sentence should not have included the seven-year minimum mandatory term. The trial court denied her motion, noting that her sentence was final when it was entered. However, on appeal, the court found that the sentence was not final, as determined by the trial court, because her appeal which challenged the sentence was still pending. Accordingly, her motion was not a postconviction motion under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a), but rather, it was a motion to preserve the sentencing issue for review in the direct appeal. Accordingly, judicial precedent applied and resentencing was mandated. The court certified a conflict with other districts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate filed a lawsuit against defendant, the head of the Florida Department of Corrections. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 57.085(7) (1997), the inmate was required to provide the court with copies of his previous civil actions. He paid to obtain copies of those documents and then he attached them to his pleading. But, subsequently, that statute was declared unconstitutional, as it denied certain prisoners access to the courts. Thereafter, all inmates whose cases had been dismissed for failure to comply with the copy requirement would have two years from the date of the decision within which to file motions seeking reinstatement of their claims. The trial court then denied the instant motion to reopen, leading to this appeal. The appeals court held that the case which held &sect; 57.085(7)&nbsp;unconstitutional specifically applied only to those inmates whose cases were dismissed for failure to comply with the copy requirement to file a motion seeking reinstatement. The inmate herein did not fall within that definition. In fact, he provided the necessary copies and made payment therefor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The statute was employed to deny the corporations the right to initiate a challenge to a proposed permit. The appellate court held that the prior case dealt with the constitutionality of the statute in a declaratory judgment context. In contrast, the corporations' appeal involved a use of a statute at a time when it was alleged to be unconstitutional. The company's argument that the appeal was moot was presented for the first time in its motion for rehearing. The mootness argument could have been made much earlier. As a result, the company was not in a position to seek rehearing under Fla. R. App. P. 9.330 on the ground that the court overlooked or misunderstood its argument; the argument simply was not made. The agency referred only to matters that were properly before the court, but it did not reveal any error in the decision. Accordingly, neither party was entitled to a rehearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant public employees union filed suit to challenge the &quot;Service First&quot; initiative, 2001 Fla. Laws ch. 043, and elements of the 2001 General Appropriations Act. The Circuit Court for Leon County, Florida, dismissed four counts of the complaint; granted summary judgment to appellee, the Florida Governor, as to three other counts; and denied the union's cross-motion for summary judgment. The union appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union was the certified bargaining agent for certain state employees, and the Governor was the employees' statutory public employer. After negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement foundered, the legislature passed ch. 043, which amended provisions of Fla. Stat. chs. 110, 216, and 447, and included proviso language in the General Appropriations Act regarding certain collective bargaining issues at impasse. The appellate court held that count I was properly dismissed, as (1) its allegations that the legislature acted improperly should have been resolved in the action it filed against that body, and (2) its allegations that the Governor acted improperly stated an alleged unfair labor practice subject to the jurisdiction of the Florida Public Employees Relations Commission. The trial judge's dismissal of count VI, on grounds the union sustained no definable or specific injury, was proper. However, as neither the State's last offer to the union nor the challenged proviso language of the General Appropriations Act was related to any specific appropriation, the proviso language clearly violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 12, and the trial court erred in dismissing count III.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grant of summary judgment to the Governor, dismissing the count alleging that the challenged proviso language of the General Appropriations Act violated the Florida Constitution, was reversed. Dismissal of the other counts was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that because the use of a weapon was not an essential element of the crimes of attempted second-degree murder or aggravated battery, the enhancements were proper. A scrivener's error in the written judgment could be corrected on remand. However, the trial court erred by sentencing defendant as a PRR because the amendment that created &sect; 775.082(9)(a)(2) was an unconstitutional violation of the single subject rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County, Florida, declared defendant, a convicted sex offender, to be a &quot;sexual predator&quot; in accordance with the Florida Sexual Predator Act (FSPA), Fla. Stat. ch. 775.21 (1999). The trial court rejected defendant's contention that FSPA was unconstitutional. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his accomplice had sexual intercourse with an unconscious woman in a hotel room to which they had taken her. Defendant pled guilty to multiple perpetrator sexual battery; since this would have automatically resulted in defendant's being declared a &quot;sexual predator&quot; under FSPA, he moved for a declaration that FSPA was unconstitutional as violative of procedural due process. The appellate court noted that once an offender was designated a &quot;sexual predator,&quot; the registration and public notification requirements of FSPA were automatically triggered. Being publicly labeled a &quot;sexual predator&quot; clearly resulted in a stigma; and under the &quot;stigma-plus test,&quot; the restrictions on the types of employment a &quot;sexual predator&quot; could have, coupled with the stigma, resulted in an infringement on a constitutionally-protected liberty interest. The total failure of FSPA to provide for a judicial hearing on the risk of defendant's committing future offenses made it violative of procedural due process, and therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed, denied rehearing, and certified conflict with a decision of an appellate court from a different district.</SPAN></P>

The Department asserted several errors on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant's license was permanently revoked after he acquired four convictions for driving under the influence.

The court granted the Department a writ of certiorari and quashed the order. Specifically, the court held that the circuit court exceeded its scope of certiorari review by ordering the Department to reinstate the applicant's license. The circuit court's review was limited to whether the hearing officer afforded the applicant due process, observed the essential requirements of the law, and whether the administrative findings were supported by competent, substantial evidence. On remand, the circuit court had to determine, in light of the criteria set out in Fla. Stat. ch. 322.271(4) (1997), whether the hearing officer's findings were supported by competent, substantial evidence and whether, in light of those findings, the hearing officer abused his discretion in denying the applicant's hardship permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant operated a pawn shop. The RICO conviction was based on predicate acts of conspiring to deal in stolen property or dealing in stolen property; undercover officers sold merchandise on various occasions to either defendant or an employee as part of a sting operation. The trial court gave a special jury instruction that tracked the language of Fla. Stat. ch. 812.022(4) (1997), which allowed the jury to infer defendant's knowledge as to whether the property was stolen. Defendant argued that the instruction violated his due process rights by creating a mandatory rebuttable presumption of guilt, but the court found instead that no factual predicate was laid for the instruction. As defendant did not participate in all of the transactions, it was error to instruct the jury under ch. 812.022(4) without limitation or clarification as to defendant's personal involvement; entitlement to the instruction was linked to defendant's personal participation. On remand, if the trial court were to determine that a ch. 812.022(4) instruction was constitutional as a permissive inference rather than a mandatory presumption, clarifying language might be advisable.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 775.21, was unconstitutional. The appellate court was unpersuaded by defendant's first three contentions. The issue of closure was not specifically preserved for appellate review because even though defendant's attorney generally objected to the closure, he did not request that defendant's family members be allowed to remain in the courtroom and did not draw the trial court's attention to the language of Fla. Stat. ch. 918.16 (1998), which exempted the parties' immediate families from exclusion from the courtroom. As to the fourth issue, the appellate court had recently determined that the Florida Sexual Predators Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State moved for rehearing of defendant's appeal of a judgment by the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Martin County (Florida) that convicted him of driving while his license was revoked in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 322.341 (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a bench trial, the State proved by competent evidence that defendant's license had been revoked pursuant to Fla. Stat. chs. 322.201 (2001) and 322.251(2) (2001). However, 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 223, the statute creating the crime of driving with a revoked license under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.341, had been declared unconstitutional. The appellate court held that defendant could not be convicted of violating &sect; 322.341. Even though the State did not request the trial judge to consider any lesser-included offenses, pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.510(b), defendant could be retried for any lesser included offense of the offense charged in the information, such as driving without a valid driver's license contrary to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.03(1), that was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State's motion for rehearing and clarification was granted; the prior opinion was withdrawn and substituted with an order that defendant's conviction and sentence be reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his habitual violent felony offender sentences were illegal, because the appellate court had held that 1999 Fla.

Stat. &sect; 775.084 (Supp. 1998) made by 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 and that defendant did not qualify as an habitual violent felony offender under the valid version of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a developer and a property owner, sued appellee city, alleging that Boca Raton, Fla., Code Ordinances &sect; 28-1556 (1999), which required a city permit for activities conducted seaward of the established coastal construction control line (CCL), was unconstitutional. The Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County, Florida, granted the city summary judgment. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) granted the developer a permit to rehabilitate a beach dune. The city cited it for violating &sect; 28-1556 by excavating the dune and building structures in a coastal area without a city permit. The city's later refusal to approve the rehabilitation project caused the DEP to revoke its permit. The trial court found that (1) the developer was collaterally estopped because its predecessor in title previously litigated the same issue, (2) the ordinance was not preempted by Fla. Stat. ch. 161, and (3) the ordinance was not unconstitutional for lacking adequate criteria to be considered upon a variance application. The appellate court agreed. As identical issues were raised and decided in the instant suit and a prior one, collateral estoppel applied. Since Boca Raton, Fla., Code Ordinances &sect; 28-1556 was more strict than Fla. Stat. ch. 161.053, in that it prohibited excavation of a dune where the state would apparently have permitted it, the statute neither preempted the ordinance nor was in conflict with it. The city's ordinances, taken as a whole, set out adequate criteria for granting variances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant vehicle owner sued appellee city in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit Court, Broward County (Florida), challenging the validity of Hollywood, Fla., Code &sect; 101.46, under which the owner's vehicle was impounded. The trial court granted the city's summary judgment motion, and the owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the owner's vehicle was impounded because he was arrested for offering to commit prostitution, he paid an administrative fee to recover his vehicle. The appellate court held the &quot;impoundment&quot; which Hollywood, Fla., Code &sect; 101.46 purported to allow met the definition of forfeitures because owners were deprived of certain rights in seized vehicles as a penalty for violating the law. The facts that the seizure might be temporary and that the vehicle could be redeemed by the payment of an administrative fee which was less than the vehicle's fair market value did not change this fact. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 932.704(1) (2002), forfeitures were preempted by the Florida Contraband Forfeiture Act (FCFA), Fla. Stat. ch. 932.701 et seq. Forfeitures under the FCFA were limited to felonies, under the definition of contraband in Fla. Stat. ch. &sect; 932.701(2)(a)5 (2002). The act for which the owner was arrested was a misdemeanor, so the forfeiture of his vehicle was unauthorized. Hollywood, Fla., Code &sect; 101.46 also impermissibly conflicted with the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 932.704(2)-(4) for judicial proceedings and jury trials regarding forfeitures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court allowed defendant to present evidence of his intoxication, but, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.051 (2001), it did not allow him to argue or to present expert testimony that his intoxication prevented him from forming the requisite mental intent to commit first-degree murder. Also, the trial court instructed the jury that voluntary intoxication was not a defense to premeditated murder and could not be considered when determining whether defendant acted with premeditation. Defendant claimed that ch. 775.051, which eliminated voluntary intoxication as a defense to criminal charges, was unconstitutional because it violated his right of procedural due process under the Florida Constitution. On appeal, the court found that (1) the due process language contained in the United States and Florida Constitutions was comparable, and there was no basis to conclude that the Florida Constitution provided greater protections to defendant than did the United States Constitution in relation to the elimination of voluntary intoxication as a defense to a criminal offense; and (2) the due process analysis applied equally under the Florida and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved for rehearing of a judgment by the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida); defendant claimed that his sentence under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(1)(d) (2001) was unconstitutional as applied because his prior convictions were not violent crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that his sentence as a violent career criminal under &sect; 775.084(1)(d) (2001) was erroneous because his prior felony convictions for burglary of an unoccupied conveyance were not violent felonies. The appellate court held that the inclusion of simple burglary in the sentencing enhancement available for violent felons under Fla. Stat. ch. 776.08 was rationally related to the legislature's goal of punishing career felony offenders. To conclude that burglary could not be a &quot;violent&quot; felony when the structure or conveyance being burglarized was unoccupied would substitute the court's opinion for the expression of the legislature. Because it was not unreasonable or irrational to equate simple burglary with a violent felony, its inclusion as a predicate offense under the violent career criminal statute did not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The motion was denied; however, the opinion was withdrawn and a new one substituted therefor. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) ordered appellant mother to pay fees related to the detainment of appellant, her son, during delinquency proceedings to cover the costs of the child's subsistence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother and son challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 985.215(6), contending that it violated equal protection when it resulted in exonerated juveniles being treated differently than exonerated adults. They also contended that the statute violated substantive due process insofar as it required payment of subsistence costs for a child's detention at home. The appeals court agreed with both assertions. Consistent with that purpose, the court had no quarrel with requiring a parent to pay the State for her child's subsistence if the child was detained at State expense. However, such was not the instant case. In such circumstances, requiring payment of subsistence costs to the State bore no rational relationship to the legislative purpose of easing the State's financial burden associated with caring for detained children because the State had suffered no burden. Moreover, the statute was arbitrary and oppressive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty in the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) of felony dumping, under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant put cars and car parts in a neighboring orange grove, without the grove owners' consent. The appellate court held defendant, because he did not preserve the issue of the constitutionality of the felony dumping statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 403.413 (2001), in the trial court, could not argue it was unconstitutional as applied to him. The appellate court could only consider the statute's facial invalidity. Defendant had to show it was unconstitutionally vague in all applications. Isolated examples defendant presented in which the statute's application might be ambiguous did not meet this burden. The statute had to be specific enough to give persons of common intelligence adequate warning of the proscribed conduct. Defendant said the statute could transform the minor traffic infraction of parking a car illegally on private property into a felony. A person of common intelligence would not read this littering statute as applicable to parking violations, and the statute adequately warned people that placing trash, including junked cars, on a neighbor's property was illegal, so it was not vague in all applications and was not facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county adopted a resolution and directed that a non-binding question be placed on the general election ballot. The taxpayer sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4 and Fla. Stat. chs. 26 and 86. Regarding his standing, the taxpayer alleged he was a resident, citizen, and taxpayer of the county. The trial court declared the resolution invalid and found the county improperly placed the non-binding referendum on the ballot. While the trial court did not address or explicitly rule on the standing issue, it implicitly found there was standing by addressing the merits of the complaint. The taxpayer suffered no special injury. The appellate court held he did not have &quot;taxpayer standing&quot; or constitutional standing. He did not assert that the county violated a specific taxing and spending power under the Florida or U.S. Constitution. Because he did not attempt to get an alternative petition placed on the ballot or offer his own ballot for submission, he could not show discrimination. It was not enough that others might be discriminated against in the future. Thus, he had no standing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was originally charged by information with trafficking in 28 grams to 30 kilograms of heroin. He entered a negotiated plea to the reduced charge of trafficking in 14 to 28 grams, in return for a 15-year minimum mandatory sentence. Defendant appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), which denied his motion for postconviction relief filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's request for relief was based on the appellate court's decision in Taylor v. State, which declared 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 unconstitutional. Specifically, defendant argued that his sentence was illegal since the amendment was not valid on the date he committed his offense, December 21, 2000. Although the appellate court agreed with defendant that his sentence was illegal, the trial court's denial of the requested relief had to be affirmed because the attack was not properly brought pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800. Defendant's sentence was the product of a negotiated plea. Both the State and defendant bargained for the agreement. While defendant sought relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800 to obtain correction only of his sentence, he was actually challenging the terms of a plea agreement, and thus the resulting convictions. Because a plea withdrawal was a potential consequence in the case, defendant had to seek relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion without prejudice to his right to file an appropriate motion.</SPAN></P>

The registration requirements under &sect; 775.21(6) did not violate the right to privacy under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The Act's public purpose was a sufficiently compelling state interest justifying the intrusion.

The court also held that the trial court's reliance upon that rule of evidence did not result in an ex post facto application of a statute and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting certain Williams rule evidence pursuant to this statute. The witness was an individual who claimed to have been repeatedly abused as a child by defendant; thus, the Williams rule evidence admitted in the case was not introduced for the purpose of establishing identity. The court concluded by certifying a question to the supreme court as to whether &sect; 90.404(2)(b) violated due process when applied in a case in which identity was not an issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was tried and found guilty of first degree felony murder and armed robbery. He was sentenced to life with no possibility of parole for 25 years for the murder and to 10 consecutive years for the robbery. After new evidence was discovered, defendant was retried. Prior to the new trial, defendant argued he was entitled to a 12-person jury because he was on trial for the capital offense of first degree murder. The State argued he had no right to a 12-person jury because double jeopardy barred a death sentence at the retrial. The trial court ruled that the case would be tried with a six person jury. The appellate court held that since defendant had received a life sentence in the original trial, he could not be subject to the death penalty again under principles of double jeopardy. Because the death penalty was not possible as a matter of law, a 12-person jury was not required. The state correctly conceded that the trial court's oral pronouncement of sentence, which was incorrect, prevailed over the written judgment and sentence form.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was not entitled to a 12-person jury because the death penalty was not a possible penalty as a matter of law. The appellate court certified that ruling as a question of great public importance. The written sentence had to be corrected to reflect that the sentence on the murder count was to be life with no possibility of parole for 25 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At defendant's trial for driving while his driver's license was permanently revoked, the State admitted into evidence a copy of defendant's driving record and showed that notice of revocation had been established. The State did not submit evidence of the driving while under the influence (DUI) convictions that formed the basis for the license revocation. On defendant's appeal, the court rejected his attacks upon the evidence at trial, but reversed his conviction in light of recent precedent from the Supreme Court of Florida. It was not necessary that the State prove at trial defendant's DUI convictions, as it was the existence of the revocation that was an element of the crime charged, not the prior DUI convictions. However, because the statute that created ch. 322.341 had been declared unconstitutional for violation of the single subject rule, defendant could not be convicted of the crime of driving while his license was permanently revoked. At trial, the trial court did not instruct the jury on any lesser-included offenses to the ch. 322.341 charge. Therefore, defendant could not be retried on any lesser-included offenses of ch. 322.341.</SPAN></P>

The corporation filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that statutory language required the state legislature to enact legislation before the claim was cognizable in state court. The Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) dismissed the suit. The consumer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the issue was whether Florida recognized a private cause of action arising under the TCPA, in the absence of specific state legislation authorizing such action. The appellate court concluded that Florida was not required to adopt enabling legislation before a state court of competent jurisdiction could entertain this federal law claim because states had the right to structure their own court systems and state courts were not obligated to change their procedural rules or to create courts to accommodate TCPA claims. The ambiguous statutory language &quot;if otherwise permitted&quot; did not explicitly direct the enactment of enabling state legislation. Nor did the legislative history support such a requirement. There was no incompatibility between state-court jurisdiction and federal interests. To the contrary, although Congress created the private TCPA action, it was from the beginning a cause of action in the states' interests. Thus, the trial court erred by dismissing the consumer's complaint.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the encounter was consensual. He also claimed that chemical castration was a cruel or unusual punishment violative of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The appellate court held that evidence of prior sexual batteries by defendant on other homeless women was relevant under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.404(2) (2002) to rebut the consent defense. However, the trial court failed to follow the procedures of Fla. Stat. ch. 794.0235(2)(a) (2000) in its imposition of chemical castration. The trial court did not at any time appoint a medical expert to opine on whether defendant was an appropriate candidate for treatment, and failed to specify the duration of treatment in the sentence. Defendant's constitutional claims were not addressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer challenged, in the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida), appellee county property appraiser's valuation of its tangible personal property for ad valorem tax purposes. The trial court upheld the property appraiser's valuations, and the taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer, a previously regulated telecommunications utility, argued that when it became unregulated and subject to competition, it was improper to use the income approach to value its tangible personal property. The appellate court held that under Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 1(a), 2, 9(a), only the State could tax intangible personal property. From the single value arrived at by the income approach to valuation of the taxpayer's tangible personal property, it was virtually impossible to segregate intangible assets and identify their values in a nonarbitrary fashion. The income method of valuation was found unconstitutional inasmuch as it taxed a cable television company's intangible property, and the same rule applied to the taxpayer. The taxpayer did not have to prove the extent to which the appraiser's valuation improperly included intangible property. The appraiser could not justify its valuation by comparing it to amounts for which the taxpayer sold access lines around the country, as these varied widely. There was no basis for applying a 30 percent intangible factor to the taxpayer's sales.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded to either establish an assessment of the taxpayer's tangible personal property based on the record or remand the matter to the appraiser.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Manatee County (Florida) committed appellant, a convicted sex offender, to the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 394.917(2) (1999). Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant suffered from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which made him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined for long-term control, care, and treatment. On appeal from a commitment order, the appeals court first held that although there were conflicts in the evidence as to the reliability of the scientific tests and the conclusions drawn, the witnesses discussed their clinical evaluations, the results of tests, and the basis for their conclusions and recommendations. Because there was substantial evidence apart from the test results supporting the State's claim that appellant met the requirements for commitment, any error in the admission of the test results was harmless. Second, appellant failed to prove any constitutional infirmity arising from Fla. Stat. ch. 394.9155(5) (1999). Third, based on the nature of commitment proceedings and the evidence was addressed at trial, factual details relating to appellant's prior offenses were properly admitted. Finally, absent objection, a jury instruction regarding appellant's inability to control himself was not grounds for reversal, but prompted review by the Florida Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed, and the following was certified to the Florida Supreme Court as a question of great public importance: May an individual be committed under the Jimmy Ryce Act in the absence of a jury instruction that the State must prove that the individual has serious difficulty in controlling his or her dangerous behavior?</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he claimed that the trial court erred by giving a jury instruction regarding Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 794.022(5) (2001) on the relevance of prophylactic condom use in sexual battery prosecution. The court disagreed, holding that the instruction properly educated the jury on the law and noting that the jury might otherwise have relied on its possibly incorrect intuitive reaction to the condom use. The court acknowledged that another subsection of &sect; 794.022 mandated a jury instruction on its topic, but held that the legislature's omission of such a mandate in &sect; 794.022(5) did not mean that an instruction on prophylactic use was barred. Rather, the court noted that the omission meant that the trial court had discretion as to whether to give such an instruction. The court also found no fundamental error in the State's closing argument when read as a whole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The association filed an action against the owner for using the deck area as a restaurant, and it responded with affirmative defenses and a counterclaim.

The owner's motion for trial on the limited issues of the association's claim for injunctive relief and its counterclaim for damages was denied, and final judgment was entered in accordance with the arbitration award. On appeal, the court noted that extensive litigation had transpired between the parties regarding the disputed use of the deck. The court held that the notice for trial by the owner was timely filed pursuant to Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.820(h) following the decision of the arbitrator and accordingly, the trial court had no discretion to deny holding a trial de novo on the stated issues. The issues were found to have been tried by consent, and accordingly the voluntary dismissal of the counterclaim did not preclude the trial de novo after decision of the arbitrator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department found that the public interest groups lacked standing to challenge the issuance of the permit, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 403.412 (2002), because they had less than 25 members living in the subject county. The mining corporation contended that the appeal should be dismissed because the public interest groups did not show that they were harmed by the order dismissing their petition before the Department, as they were entitled to intervene in the consolidated proceeding. On appeal, the court found that the public interest groups were adversely affected by the order denying their right to a formal administrative hearing on the proposed environmental permit for the simple reason that the order denied them a right to assert a challenge to the permit. If the public interest groups were wrongfully denied the right to initiate their own challenge to the permit, merely allowing them to intervene in the proceeding, which other litigants controlled, could not cure the harm. Because the order was subject to judicial review under Fla. Stat. ch. 120.68(1) (2002), the court had jurisdiction to address the merits of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State petitioned for a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) requesting that the trial court's interlocutory pretrial order granting defendant's motion in limine to exclude a forged traffic citation, based on Fla. Stat. ch. 316.650(9) (2002), be quashed. Defendant was charged with forgery pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 831.01 (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Fla. Stat. 316.650(9) (2002) barred the admission of a traffic citation he signed with a false name. The appellate court found that ch. 316.650(9) was clear and unambiguous. There was no indication that the legislature intended a different result that the exclusion of traffic citations. Further, the trial court was obligated to follow an appellate court holding that traffic citations were inadmissible in trials for forgery of the citations. The proper inquiry on certiorari was whether the trial court afforded procedural due process and applied the correct law. The trial court applied the correct law. The majority rejected the dissent's theory for granting certiorari based on the statute's violation of the constitutional principle of law that only the Florida Supreme Court could promulgate procedural rules under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(a). Even if Fla. Stat. ch. 316.650(9) (2002) was purely procedural, the constitutional limitation on the legislature's enactment of procedural law was limited to instances where the statute conflicted with a rule of the Florida Supreme Court. There was no rule governing the admissibility of traffic citations as evidence.</SPAN></P>

The fact that the prisoner waived his right to an adversarial hearing in drug court made no difference. Even if he validly made an advance waiver of his right to contest evidence that might be submitted against him in the future, that was all that he waived. He did not relieve the State of its burden to file an affidavit setting out the alleged violation. He did not relieve the State of its burden to prove the violation by competent evidence. As no evidence was presented at the hearing, the court's belief that he failed to give a required urine sample could only have been the result of hearsay from some unspecified extrajudicial source. The court never covered the clause that concerned the waiver of an adversarial hearing, so he could not have knowingly and intelligently waived his right to contest allegations against him without knowing what those allegations were. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 948.06 and Fla. Stat. ch. 948.01(13), the revocation was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted as a sexual offender. Thereafter, he was convicted of failing to register as a sexual offender. On appeal, he argued that the sexual offender registration and notification requirements in Fla. Stat. ch. 943.0435, 944.607 (2001) violated his procedural due process because he was not afforded a hearing to determine whether he was a danger to the public before being subject to the statutory requirements. He also contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 943.0435 (2001), the sexual offender registration statute, violated ex post facto principles because it was enacted after he began his sentence. Regarding procedural due process, the appellate court found that the sexual offender statute did not entitle a defendant to a hearing to establish whether he or she was dangerous, as that fact was not material under the statute; the relevant fact was whether a defendant had been convicted of a specific crime and a defendant had to be offered procedural due process before a conviction was entered. Regarding the Ex Post Facto Clause, the appellate court found its retroactive application did not violate that clause because the statute was procedural and nonpunitive in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to 4 counts of an information and was sentenced accordingly. He alleged that the mandatory minimum sentences were illegal based on Taylor v. State, which held that 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188, which provided for the imposition of mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain drug offenses, was unconstitutional, as it violated the single subject rule of the Florida Constitution. The appellate court found the dates of the commission of the offenses in question fell within the Taylor window. Defendant therefore presented facially sufficient claims in regard to the offenses of trafficking in cocaine in an amount of more than 200, but less than 400 grams, Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(1)(b). However, he was not entitled to relief on his claim that the 15-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(1)(c) was an illegal sentence, as that section was not affected by the amendments to ch. 893.135 contained in 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of fleeing and eluding, aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest with violence, and grand theft.

Defendant's previous felony convictions included burglary of an unoccupied conveyance, which he contended were not violent crimes, thereby rendering the statute unconstitutional. The court concluded that burglary of an unoccupied conveyance was included as a qualifying offense and that the effect thereof was not unconstitutional. The court found that the inclusion of burglary as a forcible felony under Fla. Stat. ch. 776.08 was rationally related to the valid legislative purpose of punishing repeat offenders more severely.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant biological parents appealed from the termination of their parental rights by the Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), after the trial court denied a request for the names of a child's foster parents, who wanted to adopt the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parents argued that they were entitled to the names of the children's foster parents and that Fla. Stat. ch. 409.175(16) (2002) was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the trial court properly focused the termination of parental rights trial on the parents' deficiencies. An evaluation of a foster parent's qualities was immaterial under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.810 (2002). The legislature intended to shield foster parents from a termination case. In fact, Fla. Stat. ch. 409.175(16) (2002) excluded information on foster parents from public record disclosure. Further, the confidentiality of foster parents' information was a matter of sound public policy. The parents' interests were protected through their ability to cross-examine all of the witnesses who testified as to the relationship between the children and the foster parents. Finally, the parents' argument that the children, through their guardian ad litem, lacked standing to join in the case as it was brought by the Florida Department of Children and Families was rejected. The guardian ad litem could have brought the termination case under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.802(1) (2002), and was entitled to participate in the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was traveling on his motorcycle at over 100 miles per hour, was wearing a black shirt with the word &quot;POLICE&quot; written on the front and back. When the real police pointed for him to move off to the shoulder of the road, defendant mouthed the word &quot;police&quot; and kept going. After finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 843.085 was content-based, and subject to strict judicial scrutiny, the appellate court held that it was unconstitutionally overbroad. It banned the wearing of any indicia of law enforcement authority regardless of the intent of the non-official. There needed to be an intent or scienter requirement. Even though the defendant's own conduct was proscribed by the statute, he nevertheless had standing to interpose and maintain an overbreadth challenge, as the statute could have a chilling effect on the exercise of First Amendment freedoms. Claimed error in the prosecutor's closing argument was found to have been in response to argument made by the defense, and therefore the claimed error was invited. Error in failing to suppress one of defendant's responses to an officer's question was harmless, given all of the other overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction and sentence for unlawful display of authorized indicia of law enforcement authority were reversed and vacated. The convictions and sentences on all remaining counts were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, an alleged victim's guardian and another, sued defendant police officers, alleging the use of excessive force. Claims were made against the individual officers, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and a state-law claim was made for battery. The officers asserted statutory immunity, under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(9) (1997). The Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) granted summary judgment to the officers. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim committed no offense, but acted strangely. He was left in a vegetative state as a result of his encounter with the police. The police offered no plausible explanation for the severity of the victim's injuries. The trial court, in granting summary judgment, found, as a matter of law, that the actions of the officers were reasonable. The appellate court disagreed. The fact that the victim committed no offense at all militated against the use of force, much less the force used in the instant case to effect the victim's detention. There was no evidence that the victim posed any immediate threat to others. The officers should have known, based upon the state of the law at the time of the incident, that their actions violated the victim's constitutional rights. The officers contended that their testimony was unrefuted, as the victim was in a vegetative state and could not raise an issue of material fact. The appellate court found that standing alone, the fact that the substance of the officers' internal affairs interviews conflicted with their deposition testimony raised a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of the force used and the officers' credibility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was reversed and remanded for further proceedings on both claims. It was ordered that the individual officers were not entitled to either qualified immunity or statutory immunity as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

Although the attempted second-degree murder conviction was properly treated as a first-degree felony under Fla. Stat. chs. 782.04(2), 777.04 (1999), the written judgment incorrectly noted it as a second-degree felony. The aggravated battery conviction under Fla. Stat. ch. 784.07(2)(d) (1999) was not reclassified based on the use of a weapon, but on the fact that the victim was a law enforcement officer. The prison releasee reoffender sentence was erroneously entered under the amendment to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The billing company accepted an assignment of PIP benefits from the insured. The assignment was given for the purpose of billing the insurer for treatment rendered to the insured by health care providers. The insurer moved to dismiss, contending that Fla.

The insurer maintained that, under the statute, it was only required to make payment to four identified entities: a physician, a hospital, a clinic, or another person lawfully rendering treatment. On appeal, the court found that the insured's assignment to the billing company was not prohibited by the language of ch. 627.736(5), as a PIP insured could assign an after-loss claim to a third party who was not a medical provider.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer argued that Boca Raton, Fla., Code of Ordinances &sect; 28-1556 (1999), which required a permit to perform excavation, was preempted by the Florida Beach and Shore Preservation Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 161. The appellate court held that the developer was collaterally estopped from litigating the preemption and inconsistency arguments due to litigation brought by the developer's predecessor, which determined that ch. 161 did not preempt the City from regulating seaward of the CCL. Even if collateral estoppel did not apply, the Act did not impliedly preempt the ordinance. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) had always interpreted the Act as allowing local setback ordinances, and DEP's interpretation was given considerable deference. Boca Raton, Fla., Code of Ordinances &sect; 28-1556(4) was more strict than the Act. Therefore, the statute neither preempted the ordinance nor was in conflict with it. As &sect; 28-1556(4) was part of the same chapter as Boca Raton, Fla., Code of Ordinances &sect; 28-130, its criteria applied to variances sought under Boca Raton, Fla., Code of Ordinances &sect; 28-1556(4).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that she was arrested while riding a moped and charged with driving with a suspended license. She argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 322.03(1) (2001) did not provide a clear meaning of the conduct which was prohibited by statute, thereby rendering it unconstitutionally vague. She also argued that a motor vehicle, as defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 316.003(21), specifically excluded bicycles and mopeds from the definition. Thus, she concluded that it would be reasonable to assume that a moped was not a motor vehicle. The circuit court found for defendant and ruled that Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(2) was unconstitutional as applied in the case. On appeal, the court found that driving a moped required a license because a moped was not excluded from the definition of a motor vehicle in Fla. Stat. ch. 322.01(26) (2001). Further, there was no vagueness or ambiguity in ch. 322.34 with respect to mopeds which would render the statute unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee child care agency filed a petition in the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), for termination of appellant mother's parental rights. The trial court concluded that the child care agency proved its case for termination in accordance with both Fla. Stat. ch. 39.806(1)(c), (i), and terminated the mother's parental rights. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's parental rights to her first six children were terminated due to her failure to comply with court-ordered case plan tasks. The agency alleged that, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 39.806(1)(c), the mother failed to comply with prior case plans leading to the termination of her rights to the other children. As a second ground for termination, the agency alleged that the mother's rights to her sixth child were involuntarily terminated and constituted a ground for termination under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.806(1)(i) as to the seventh and subject child. A counselor for the agency admitted that the agency relied solely on the mother's history and not on any new allegations of neglect relating to the subject child. In fact, she conceded that the mother had made several efforts to improve herself and her ability to parent the subject child, which she had not done with the other children. The guardian ad litem also opined as to the mother's improved efforts at child rearing as to the subject child. On appeal, the court found that the agency failed to prove the ch. 39.806(1)(c) requirements for termination. Further, the court found ch. 39.806(1)(i) to be facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with drug trafficking. After the trial court denied his dispositive motion to suppress evidence, defendant entered a negotiated plea of no contest to the charge in exchange for a sentence of three years in prison. The trial court then imposed a three-year minimum mandatory sentence, even though the written plea agreement did not contain reference to a minimum mandatory term. On appeal, defendant argued that his sentence had to be reversed based on the appellate court's Taylor opinion that held the Florida law that required mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain drug offenses was unconstitutional because it violated the single-subject rule of the Florida Constitution. After considering that argument, the appellate court found that defendant did not preserve that issue for review either at sentencing or by filing an appropriate motion. It then affirmed the trial court's judgment, but without prejudice to defendant's right to file a facially-sufficient motion for postconviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, if he determined that doing so was is in his best interest, because defendant might have a cognizable Taylor claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a petition for writ of certiorari to challenge an affirmance by the trial court (Florida) of a county court order which dismissed the State's action against respondent criminal defendants for violation of a state administrative rule that barred the harvesting and possessing of &quot;short&quot; spiny lobsters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The criminal defendants caught several &quot;short&quot; spiny lobsters. When harvested, each lobster had a carapace measurement of over three inches. When the criminal defendants arrived back at the dock, the lobsters' heads were separated from their tails. One criminal defendant then disposed of the heads. When he returned from doing so, Fish and Wildlife officers determined that 186 of the lobsters had tails less than five-and-one-half inches in length. The criminal defendants were then charged with violating Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 68B-24.003(1), prohibiting a person from possessing any spiny lobster with a carapace measurement of three inches or less, or if the tail had been separated from the body, a tail measurement less than five-and-one-half inches not including protruding muscle tissue. The county court dismissed the action on the ground that the provision was unconstitutional. The trial court affirmed. After the State filed a petition for writ of certiorari, the appellate court found that the provision was not unconstitutional because the two measurements were not inconsistent; if either measurement violated the provision, the lobster could not be harvested or possessed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court granted the petition for writ of certiorari, ordered that the trial court's affirmance was quashed and that the cause be remanded to the trial court with directions to reverse the county court order on appeal and to order that the case proceed to trial.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, defendant was aware of the registration requirement. The &quot;controlling&quot; case dealt with a jury instruction that the State was not required to prove scienter or guilty knowledge to obtain a conviction for a failure to register. There was no indication that the trial court decided the case based on an erroneous determination that no &quot;broadly applicable guilty knowledge requirement&quot; was applicable. As such, the &quot;controlling&quot; case was distinguishable and did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeal of Florida, Third District, declined to follow the lead of the other appellate districts. It held that an order reducing a charge in the information or indictment was an order dismissing the charge. As Fla. Stat. ch. 924.07 (2000) authorized the State to appeal orders dismissing an indictment or information or any count therein, the appellate court had jurisdiction over the State's appeal under Fla. R.

He was sentenced to a total of seven years' imprisonment. Also, a $ 100,000 fine was imposed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(c)(1)(b) (1997-2001).

However, the memorandum was not properly sworn to, and the trial court correctly refused to consider it. In ground three, defendant alleged that the $ 100,000 fine for trafficking in oxycodone was illegally imposed. The appellate court concluded that the imposition of the fine was mandatory pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(c)(1)(b) (1997), which was in existence prior to the passage of 1999 Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After an automobile was involved in an accident and four passengers were killed, and one was seriously injured, appellees, a personal representative and others, brought wrongful death actions and an action for personal injury against appellant rental car company as the vicariously liable vehicle owner. The rental car company appealed the order of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which granted summary final judgment to appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The rental car company informed appellees that pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 324.021(9)(b)(2) (1999), which limited the liability of short term lessors for motor vehicles, its maximum liability to appellees was $ 800,000, and offered to tender that amount. However, appellees sought a declaration that Fla. Stat. ch. 324.021(9)(b)(2) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the rental car company argued that the trial court erred in finding that 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 225 violated the single-subject rule of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, and that Fla. Stat. ch. 324.021(9)(b)(2) itself violated no provision of the Florida Constitution. The appellate court agreed with the rental car company for the reasons set forth by the First District Court of Appeal in another case. In that case, the First District reversed a trial court's determination that 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 225 was unconstitutional, concluding that 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 225 did not violate the single-subject rule. In addition, that court also held that Fla. Stat. ch. 324.021 did not violate a plaintiff's right of access to courts, a plaintiff's right to trial by jury, or the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered the award after the insured failed to prevail in her claim for damages under the personal injury protection provision (PIP) of her insurance policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured's action alleged that she did not receive payment of medical treatment and expenses arising from injuries she sustained in an automobile accident, for which she had PIP insurance. The insurer had claimed that the insured had unreasonably refused to submit to an independent medical exam. The insured rejected the insurer's proposal of settlement, and after trial the jury rendered a verdict of no liability for the insurer. The trial court awarded costs and fees to the insurer pursuant to ch. 769.79(1). The insured contended that ch. 768.79 did not apply to PIP claims, or alternatively, that the settlement proposal was not valid. The trial court rejected the insured's arguments but certified the question as to whether the insurer could recover attorney's fees under ch. 768.79 and Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442 in such an action. The court held that the insurer could recover in that situation, although it certified the question for review to the higher court. However, the court also held that the settlement proposal in the instant case was not valid because the release was either overly broad or ambiguous, and accordingly the trial court's award of damages was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order awarding costs and fees, and certified the same question to the higher court for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, convicted in the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) of attempted first-degree murder of a law-enforcement officer in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 782.04(1)(a)(1), 777.04(1), and 784.07(3) (1991), challenged the denial of his motion filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850, wherein he claimed that a supreme court decision, Thompson v. State, should be retroactively applied to reverse his judgment and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted fundamental error on appeal, because the State failed to prove as an essential element that he knew the victim was a law-enforcement officer. After considering case precedent in Florida, the appellate court found Moreland v. State controlling. If the trial court certified conflict with Grinage v. State in defendant's direct appeal, the supreme court could have considered his case, decided it in the manner it did Thompson, which held that knowledge of the victim's status as a law-enforcement officer was a necessary element of the offense, and remanded for a new trial. The appellate court therefore reversed, and certified conflict with Sweeney v. State, wherein the Fourth District refused to apply Thompson retroactively. The appellate court was unable to reconcile Thompson with either supreme court decisions that &quot;clarified&quot; statutory law or decisions that &quot;changed&quot; the law. The court certified the following question as one of great public importance: &quot;whether the analysis of State v. Klayman applies when an issue that the supreme court has clarified requires resolution of a disputed factual matter?&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed and remanded for either a new trial or entry of a conviction for the lesser-included offense of attempted murder and resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sent various letters and papers to the attorney representing his former wife in a contentious post-judgment family law proceeding, and to the circuit court. Defendant appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for Seminole County (Florida), which convicted him of sending written threats of death or bodily injury in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 836.10 (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 836.10 was unconstitutional, as it was vague, overbroad, and infringed on his First Amendment rights. He also argued that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury and by improperly prohibiting him from filing any pro se pleadings or papers in the future, as a condition of his probation. The appellate court concluded that Fla. Stat. ch. 836.10 was not vague and was not constitutionally infirm because it was overbroad. Because threats to injure or kill were not constitutionally protected, defendant's First Amendment rights were not compromised by laws prohibiting such threats. In addition, the appellate court concluded that the trial court properly instructed the jury as to the elements of the charged crime. Finally, the prohibition against pro se filings as a special condition of probation did not constitute error, fundamental or otherwise. Admittedly, the condition of probation banning pro se filings burdened defendant's constitutional right to access to the courts under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. However, the record supported the imposition of this condition of probation considering defendant's crime and past conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his habitual violent felony offender minimum mandatory sentence was illegal because of Taylor v. State, which held 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 unconstitutional in violation of the single subject rule. In Green v. State, the appellate court had previously held that the legislature's retroactive reenactment of 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 was invalid. Therefore, defendant would be entitled to relief under Taylor if his sentence was affected by the amendments in 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188. However, the minimum mandatory sentencing provisions for habitual violent felony offenders were already present in Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 when the legislature adopted 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188, and they were not affected by the amendments in 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188. Thus, defendant was not entitled to relief on this basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court quoted in the injunction from the deposition of a psychiatrist, which had been taken in the employee's workers' compensation case, in which the psychiatrist testified that the employee had made threats, talked about his guns, and was a danger.

The appellate court concluded that the trial court's ruling was improper because the deposition was taken in a proceeding involving different issues. It did not meet the requirements of the hearsay exception for former testimony found in Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(22). In addition, the trial court also erred in admitting a letter written by the employee's workers' compensation counsel, on the ground that the counsel was his agent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, various entities comprising cigarette companies and industry organizations, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), which awarded compensatory damages to three individual plaintiffs in their class action lawsuit on behalf of smokers and their survivors, and also awarded $ 145 billion in punitive damages to the entire class, wherein damages had been sought for injuries caused by smoking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The individuals' class action was based on assorted injuries caused by smoking and a variety of tort and breach of warranty claims were alleged. The class was certified to include Florida smokers and their survivors who suffered an injury or death due to cigarette addiction. The jury rendered a verdict for the class on liability and punitive damage entitlement, and determined damage amounts for the individual class representatives and for the class. Defendants filed post-verdict motions seeking, inter alia, remittitur and decertification. The trial court entered an omnibus order which required payment of the judgments by defendants and a reservation of jurisdiction for further individual hearings. Defendants appealed and the court held that decertification of the class should have been granted due to the multitudinous individual issues, including choice-of-law, liability, reliance, affirmative defenses, damages, and medical causation. The court also found that the punitive damages required reversal because there was no prior determination of liability and compensatory damages, it was based on jury nullification, it was excessive, and it was precluded by res judicata.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter with instructions that the class be decertified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment denying her post-conviction relief. In her motion, she alleged that the three-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment imposed by the trial court, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(c)(1)(a) (2000), was illegal based on the case of Taylor v. State. In the Taylor case, the Florida Court of Appeals held that the imposition of mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain drug offenses was unconstitutional, as it violated the single subject rule of the Florida Constitution. However, in Green v. State, re-enactment of the sentencing provisions of 1999 Fla. Laws. ch. 188 could not have been applied retroactively. The instant court held that defendant, through her allegations that she committed the offense of trafficking in hydromorphone within the window under Taylor, presented a facially sufficient claim. On remand, if she was correct in her assertions, the trial court was to resentence her under the 1997 version of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(c)(1)(a). The appeals court also certified conflict with the Fourth and Fifth District cases with which it disagreed with in Green v. State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner took title to the property from the grantor, who failed to pay the property taxes, by a quitclaim deed. The deed was recorded, although it was not signed by the grantor. Before the deed was corrected, the purchasers bought the property at a tax sale. The clerk waited approximately five months before noticing and setting the tax deed sale; during the time lapse, the name on the tax assessment roll changed. The appellate court held that Florida's scheme for enforcement of property taxes was designed to afford due process to interested persons. The appellate court, in conflict with Delta Property Management v. Profile Investments, Inc., 830 So. 2d 867 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2002), held that the owner had a &quot;reasonably ascertainable&quot; interest of record and was entitled to notice of a tax sale, as the property had been assessed to him. When the clerk failed to schedule a tax sale and mail notice thereof within a reasonable time after the filing of an application for a tax deed, and a new tax roll assessment intervened during such period of delay, the clerk had to obtain an updated statement from the tax collector for notification purposes.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to concurrent sentences: a mandatory minimum sentence of 28 years in prison on the murder charge and 5 years in prison, with a 3 year mandatory minimum, on the assault charge.</SPAN></P>

Taking a gun from his bedroom, defendant rode his bike back to school and asked a teacher to let 2 girls leave the class to talk to him. The teacher refused, and defendant shot him in the head. The appellate court held defendant was afforded the same procedural rights as anyone else charged with first-degree murder by indictment. Children 13 and under could be prosecuted in adult court only by indictment. The involuntary waiver provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 985.226(2) (1999) did not apply. Fla. Stat. ch. 985.225, which allowed defendant to be tried as an adult, was constitutional. The prosecutor's closing argument did not reach the critical mass of fundamental error. The most serious prosecutorial lapse was making comments designed to evoke sympathy for the victim. There was abundant evidence to support a conviction of first-degree murder, let alone second-degree murder. The 28-year mandatory minimum sentence was lawful. The jury's verdict was sufficient to support the mandatory minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) entered a judgment that denied defendant's Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion to challenge the legality of his seven-year and 15-year mandatory minimum sentences imposed after he entered guilty pleas in separate drug trafficking cases. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to trafficking in cocaine. The trial court then imposed a seven-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(1)(b) (1999-2000). He also pled guilty in another trial court case to trafficking in even more cocaine. The trial court imposed a 15-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(1)(c) on that offense. After judgments of conviction were entered, defendant filed a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion alleging the sentences were illegal based on a ruling that imposition of mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain drug offenses was unconstitutional because the law permitting them violated the Florida Constitution. The trial court denied the motion and found the legislature had cured the defect, reenacted the law, and that reenactment was retroactive to a certain date. After defendant appealed, the appellate court found that retroactive application as to his seven-year mandatory minimum sentence might violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and Florida Constitutions, although the same was not true with regard to his 15-year mandatory minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment was affirmed to the extent that if denied defendant's motion for correction, modification, or reduction of 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. However, its judgment denying that motion as to his seven-year mandatory minimum sentence was reversed and the cause was remanded for further consideration of his seven-year mandatory minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the judgment entered. The appeals court upheld the trial court's decision. As to the third ground, the appeals court agreed that defendant failed to present a facially sufficient claim. In his motion, he alleged that he received a total of seven years' imprisonment with a three-year mandatory minimum for the charge of trafficking in a prescription drug. In ground two, he alleged that counsel was ineffective for failing to move to dismiss the charge of possession of another drug after he informed his trial counsel that he had a prescription. The facts supporting his claim were contained in the memorandum of law attached to the motion. However, the memorandum was not properly sworn to, and thus unworthy of consideration. Further, defendant failed to affirmatively allege that he committed the offense on a date within the Taylor window. Finally, the court affirmed that portion of the trial court's order denying ground three, because the mandatory fine was not part of his plea bargain. Defendant did not seek to withdraw his plea on this basis, and the fine was mandatory, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(c)(1)(b) (1997-2001).</SPAN></P>

The trial court reviewed the records in camera and gave the Department access to statements the minor's parents made to the psychologist, but the court's order did not restrict access by the guardian. The trial court also ruled that the psychologist could testify on a limited basis. In the minor's appeal from the trial court's rulings, the appellate court held that (1) it would review the trial court's orders as if a petition for a writ of certiorari was filed challenging the denial of a protective order; (2) the minor had the right to assert the psychotherapist/patient privilege; and (3) because the minor made a prima facie showing that she would be harmed by release of the records, the appellate court would quash the trial court's order allowing her guardian unrestricted access.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court treated the minor's appeal as a petition for certiorari, granted the petition, and quashed the trial court's order allowing the guardian ad litem unrestricted access to the records created by the minor's psychologist because the trial court issued its order without hearing the minor's objections.</SPAN></P>

In her motion, she alleged that she pleaded to trafficking in methamphetamine and that the seven-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment imposed by the trial court was illegal based on the case of Taylor v. State. In that case, the instant court held that the imposition of mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain drug offenses was unconstitutional, as it violated the single subject rule of the Florida Constitution. However, in Green v. State, re-enactment of the sentencing provisions of 1999 Fla. Laws. ch. 188 could not have been applied retroactively. The instant court held that defendant, through her allegations that she committed the offense of trafficking in methamphetamine within the window under Taylor, presented a facially sufficient claim. On remand, if she was correct in her assertions, the trial court was to resentence her under the 1997 version of 1999 Florida Laws ch. 188. The appeals court also certified conflict with the Fourth and Fifth District cases with which it disagreed with in Green v. State.</SPAN></P>

Stat. chs. 63.087, 63.088(5) (2002) were not unconstitutional as they related to private adoptions under the Florida Adoption Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Each of the four appellants sought to allow a private adoption of their child but the identity of the father was not known and accordingly, constructive notice was required under Fla. Stat. chs. 63.087, 63.088(5). Appellants contended that their rights to privacy pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. 14 and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 were violated. However, the trial court found that the law was constitutional due to the State's compelling interest, and that no less intrusive means was shown to achieve the same interest. However, the trial court held the law unconstitutional with respect to women whose pregnancies were the result of a sexual battery. On appeal, the court found that chs. 63.087, 63.088(5) were unconstitutional invasions of the mothers' rights to privacy because they substantially interfered with both a woman's independence in choosing adoption as an alternative to giving birth and with the right not to disclose the intimate personal information that was required when the father was unknown. The State failed in its burden of proof as to a showing of a sufficiently compelling interest for such an invasion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant moved for rehearing in the State's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), seeking to quash an order limiting the State's ability to impeach a State witness, after the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, but granted defendant's motion under Morton.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The witness recanted the part of her statement where she said that defendant called her and admitted shooting the victim. The State's highest court held that since there was a legitimate purpose for calling the witness, the State, as the party calling the witness, could impeach her with a prior inconsistent statement. The State could not, however, offer the witness's original statement through a detective that defendant admitted the shooting as a statement by the witness of identification of a person made after perceiving the person under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.801(2)(c) (2001). The substance of defendant's statement went beyond being a statement of identification for purposes of ch. 90.801(2)(c). The exercise of certiorari jurisdiction was appropriate, as the trial court order was at odds with Morton and represented a departure from the essential requirements of law. Further, the excluded matter was important evidence that, if not presented at trial, might significantly impair the State's prosecution of defendant. Finally, since the State had no appellate remedy if there was an acquittal of defendant, the State did not have an adequate remedy by way of appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition for a writ of certiorari was granted. Defendant's motion for rehearing was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The contractor contended that the association was a proper class representative under Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.221. The appellate court held that the suit against the homeowners' association, as the representative of the class of unit owners, was proper as the controversy was of common interest to all units. The appellate court distinguished cases holding that the unit owners could not be individually joined as defendants under Fla. Stat. ch. 718.119, as the action was not against the owners, but against the association as the representative of the class of units sharing the undivided ownership of the common elements. The contractor did not seek individual money judgments against the owners. To the extent that the complaint might be interpreted by the trial court as seeking a money judgment against the individual unit owners, leave to amend was to be granted. The appellate court certified the question as to the ability of a plaintiff to sue a class of condominium unit owners as a class represented by the homeowners' association in controversies concerning matters of common interest under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled no contest to trafficking in more than 400 grams of cocaine, trafficking in four grams or more of heroin, and trafficking in 28 grams or more of cocaine. Defendant challenged the denial by the Circuit Court for Lee County (Florida) of his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b) motion in which he claimed that the three-year minimum mandatory terms imposed for trafficking in heroin and trafficking in 28 grams or more of cocaine were illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In support of his argument, defendant cited to Taylor, which found that 1999 Fla. Laws. ch. 188, providing for the imposition of minimum mandatory sentences was unconstitutional. In response, the State argued that the trial court did not err when it imposed the minimum mandatory sentences because before the Taylor opinion became final, the legislature reenacted the minimum mandatory terms for drug trafficking and provided for retroactive application of the statute. However, the appellate court had recently rejected the State's argument in Green.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirm the convictions; affirmed the sentence for trafficking in 400 grams or more of cocaine; reversed the sentences for trafficking in four grams or more of heroin and trafficking in 28 grams or more of cocaine; and remanded for resentencing on those two convictions in accordance with the valid laws in effect on the date of the offenses, December 14, 1999.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida), which entered a conviction against him for robbery with a firearm and designated him as a prison releasee reoffender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial record indicated that defendant had committed the robbery while using a type of revolver designed to fire a type of bullet that was not commercially available. However, the bullets could be made by someone skilled in hand loading ammunition. An expert at trial indicated that the weapon would fire if loaded with the proper ammunition, although the expert was unable to determine the precise make, model, or serial number of the weapon. Defendant was convicted and appealed. The court initially held that the evidence was sufficient to prove that he possessed a firearm because the weapon that defendant had fit within the definition of &quot;firearm&quot; contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 790.001(6) (2000). The court also held that 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 210 applied retroactively and cured the unconstitutionality of the prison releasee reoffender status law of 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 1888. However, the court acknowledged that its opinion conflicted with another on the same issue and certified the question as to retroactive application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. However, the court also certified a question as to the ability to apply a statute allowing for classification as a prison releasee reoffender retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Circuit Court for Orange County, Florida, convicted defendant of robbery, battery, and petit theft, and sentenced him thereon. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his convictions, first arguing that he should be re-sentenced on the robbery charge because the habitual violent offender statute was unconstitutional. However, the appeals court certified the question of whether the curative statute passed in 2002 should have been applied retroactively to the offenses defendant committed in 2000. Defendant next argued that double jeopardy barred his dual convictions for petit theft and robbery. The appeals court agreed. It was clear from the information and proofs offered at trial that the robbery and petit theft charges were based on the taking of the cash drawer containing cash from the clerk during the same incident. Herein, there was no separation of anything: not time, object, place, or circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The robbery sentence was affirmed, but the petit theft conviction and sentence were reversed, and a question was certified as to whether the curative statute should have been applied retroactively to the offenses defendant committed. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee, a former state employee, sued appellant, the Florida Department of Insurance, claiming that the Department's withdrawal of legal representation constituted a breach of contract. The Department moved to dismiss the case due to improper venue pursuant to the &quot;home venue privilege.&quot; The Department appealed the non-final order of the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), which denied its motion to dismiss due to improper venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the Department argued that the trial judge erred in refusing to dismiss the case because under Florida's home venue privilege, the proper venue would be Leon County where the Department's principle headquarters was located. The employee argued that valid exceptions to the home venue privilege applied. The appellate court concluded that the joint tortfeasor exception did not apply because the Department was not sued as a joint tortfeasor. The case was a simple breach of contract claim by the employee against the Department. In addition, the employee could not characterize his breach of contract claim against the Department as an unconstitutional taking of a property interest so as to invoke the sword wielder doctrine. There was no constitutional right in Florida to have one's attorney's fees paid; thus, no constitutionally guaranteed right or property interest was infringed upon. Furthermore, the employee was not entitled by statute to have his fees paid under Fla. Stat. ch. 111.07, as individual application of ch. 111.07 was to be decided by the respective governmental unit (i.e. the Department), not the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed the order of the trial court, which denied the motion to dismiss. The case was remanded with directions that the trial court transfer the case to Leon County, Florida.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that his sentence as a prison releasee reoffender was illegal based on Taylor, which held that 1999 Fla.

However, since defendant had not alleged that he was affected by the amendments to the prison releasee reoffender statute, the appellate court concluded that his claim was facially insufficient. Defendant also argued that his sentence violated double jeopardy because the enhancement of his sentence contained two punishments for one criminal episode. However, defendant did not explain the enhancement or the two punishments to which he referred nor did he allege that his entitlement to relief could be determined from the face of the record.
