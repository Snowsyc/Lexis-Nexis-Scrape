Code Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 7040 about protecting homeowners, an owner of a manufactured home community seeking a rent increase above the consumer price index for urban consumers could not meet its burden under Del. Code Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 7042 merely by producing evidence of the market rent factor in &sect; 7042(c), but was also required to show under &sect; 7042(a)(2) that its proposed increase was directly related to operating, maintaining, or improving the manufactured home community; [2]-At an arbitration hearing, the owner could prove market rent with evidence of advertised rents at comparable communities and was not limited to evidence of actual rents because Del. Code Ann. tit. 25, &sect; 7043(d)-(g) provided for the application of the Delaware Uniform Rules of Evidence, thus allowing introduction of relevant evidence as defined in Del. R. Evid. 401.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1102, defendant's constitutional vagueness argument was without merit as an ordinary person could easily understand that leaving two young children alone in an unlocked car in near triple-digit heat for at least 15 minutes with the windows almost rolled up could be injurious to the physical, mental, or moral welfare of the children, and expert testimony was unnecessary to prove what was within an ordinary person's ability to understand; the information provided defendant with adequate notice of the charges; and the information was sufficient as leaving the children alone in a car on an extremely hot day could likely cause physical and mental harm to the children, and the information covered any one of the three harms covered by the statute.</SPAN></P>

Granville; [3]-The trial court's failure to state that the parents' objections to visitation were unreasonable by clear and convincing evidence was not reversible error, as the record showed the court made its findings under the clear and convincing evidence standard.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214(a), as the designation of the inmate's conviction for possession of a firearm by a person prohibited as a violent felony under Del.

XIV, precluded the exercise of general jurisdiction over a corporation unless its affiliations with the state were so continuous and systematic as to render it essentially at home there; [2]-The court observed that contrary language in Sternberg v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Kent County, that convicted him of first-degree rape and unlawful conduct against a child by a sex offender; defendant claimed that the trial court reversibly erred by denying his (and the State's) joint motion to sever the Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 777A charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly committed sexual assault against his 8-year-old stepdaughter. At the time of the alleged incident, defendant had a previous sex offense conviction on his record and was registered as a sex offender. After the unlawful conduct charge was vacated and before the retrial, defendant and the State moved to sever the unlawful conduct charge from the rape charges, because the jury's knowledge of defendant's sex offender status would materially prejudice his defense against the rape charges. The motion was denied because the trial judge found that defendant's prior sexual misconduct was markedly pertinent to the consideration and understanding of whether or not he committed another sexual crime. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that defendant's stipulation to his sex offender status was made only after the trial court had improperly denied his and the State's severance motion. Therefore, it could not, by itself, constitute a waiver of his right to argue his entitlement to bifurcation. In any event, the decision in Monceaux v. State, 51 A.3d 474 (Del. 2012), which was rendered while defendant's appeal was pending, required bifurcation of all &sect; 777A cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state employee sought review of an order by the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Kent County, order affirming a Merit Employee Relations Board (MERB) order denying his appeal from the termination of his employment. The employee argued, inter alia, that he should have been subject to discipline, if at all, under the Merit Rules, not Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 5954, and that &sect; 5954 was unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While working as a Delaware government employee in a state government building, the employee made three postings on an internet forum about his personal political campaign in violation of &sect; 5954. As a permanent merit employee, he was subject to the Merit Rules. He appealed his termination to the MERB, which upheld his termination. Del. Merit R. 1.2 provided that in the event of a conflict, &sect; 5954 trumped the Merit Rules. Thus, the appellate court held that the MERB correctly evaluated the conduct under &sect; 5954, rather than under the Merit Rules. However, whether or not Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 2509A was found to be the appropriate test for defining &quot;political activity&quot; under &sect; 5954, the trial court erred by not considering the employee's &sect; 2509A argument. Because both the MERB and the trial court relied on the rescinded three-factor standard, and the trial court erred in declining to address the employee's &sect; 2509A claim, the matter had to be remanded for such further proceedings as may be appropriate to determine what constituted a &quot;political activity&quot; under &sect; 5954. Section 5954's prohibition on political activity did not violate the employee's First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the order determining that &sect; 5954 did not violate the employee's First Amendment right to free speech was affirmed. The remainder of the order was reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings to consider what constituted political activity under &sect; 5954 and whether &sect; 5954 was unconstitutionally overbroad or vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Sussex County denied defendant's motion to dismiss, a jury convicted defendant of second degree unlawful sexual contact and offensive touching. The trial court then, among other things, found that defendant was a registered sex offender at the time of the acts constituting unlawful sexual contact and sentenced defendant under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 777A. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 777A violated his right to due process because placing his status as a sex offender directly in issue lessened the State's burden of proof and the presumption of innocence. The appellate court found no merit to this claim. The bifurcation procedure used by the trial judge prevented the jury from hearing evidence of defendant's sex offender status before determining his guilt for purposes of &sect; 777A. The trial court cured any alleged constitutional infirmity by requiring a redacted charge and bifurcating defendant's trial. The jury was not presented with, and did not consider, any evidence or allegation of defendant's sex offender status before it convicted him. The bifurcation and redaction of the charging document mooted the significant constitutional issue defendant raised. Bifurcation was required for all future trials under &sect; 777A. Defendant also claimed that the trial judge erred by failing to address his constitutional argument when denying his motion to dismiss. Because the alternate relief requested in defendant's motion to dismiss was bifurcation, which the trial judge granted, this claim also lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Sussex County, which convicted him of reckless murder in the course of fleeing a robbery, although he was acquitted of reckless murder of a police officer. Defendant was also convicted of multiple other offenses, and a sentence of death was imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and others drove to a fast-food restaurant within the intent to rob a drug dealer. The plan went awry and when police pursued them and the driver stopped the vehicle, defendant fired shots that fatally wounded one off-duty police officer. Defendant was indicted on 14 charges. His motions to transfer venue and to preclude the State from seeking the death penalty were denied. Defendant was found guilty by the jury of multiple offenses. Based on a finding of aggravating factors that outweighed mitigating factors, a sentence of death was imposed. On appeal, the court found no error in the denial of the transfer of venue motion under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 21(a), as juror prejudice was not presumed. The trial court's refusal to give instructions of alternative defense theories requested by defendant was warranted by the evidence. The imposition of the death penalty did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII due to defendant's &quot;reckless indifference&quot; to the unjustified risk of death. The death sentence was properly imposed and not disproportionate under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209(d)(1). The victim's status as an off-duty officer was considered in this regard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of two counts of assault in a Detention facility. Upon motion by the State, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Kent County declared defendant to be a habitual offender and sentenced him to a total period of sixteen years at Level V incarceration to be followed by a six month term of probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to defendant's numerous assignments of error, the appellate court concluded, inter alia, that the trial judge did not err in failing to recuse himself where the only arguable appearance of bias was based on the judge's adverse rulings in the case and the rulings were based on application of law and not any personal bias. Sentencing defendant as an habitual offender was error, because, as admitted by the State, the offenses relied upon overlapped. Because the evidence at trial showed that defendant's assaults were preemptive strikes on correctional officers who were lawfully performing their duties, there was no error in the trial court's ruling that defendant's &quot;state of mind&quot; evidence was irrelevant. There was also no merit in defendant's claim that the trial court erred in not requiring the State to articulate race-neutral reasons for using two of its peremptory challenges to strike African-American jurors, as defendant failed to make a prima facie showing that the two challenges were based on race, particularly where only two of the State's challenges were used on African-American jurors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that defendant's right to bear arms under Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 authorized his carrying a concealed knife in his home. Defendant was in his home, using a knife to carry out the everyday household activity of opening a box. It would be unreasonable to restrict the manner in which one could carry a legal weapon from room to room within one's home. There was no suggestion that defendant attempted to use the knife as a weapon, even after he became belligerent and resisted arrest. When the police confronted defendant they asked whether he had a knife. At that point, the balance between defendant's interest in carrying a concealed weapon in his home and the State's interest in public safety shifted in favor of the State. Defendant was no longer using the knife for household purposes, and his failure to reveal that he was carrying a weapon could have represented a serious threat to the police. The jury was not instructed to decide whether defendant was given the opportunity to disclose that he was carrying the knife, and, if so, whether he did so truthfully. Those factual findings would determine whether defendant could can be convicted of CCDW.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former state employee filed a grievance in which she claimed that she was wrongfully fired by appellee Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS). Appellee Merit Employee Relations Board (MERB) denied the grievance. The Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for New Castle County affirmed the MERB's decision. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, an accounting specialist, was found to have an unacceptable error rate. The court rejected the employee's claim that her firing violated due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The MERB's findings regarding the employee's errors and her failure to improve despite frequent counseling constituted substantial evidence that the termination was for just cause. The employee received a meaningful opportunity to present her case and was held to Delaware's &quot;just cause&quot; standard, which was the specific state law entitlement to which she claimed a property right. Next, the MERB did not improperly rely on facts outside the record. In commenting about her past experience at DHSS, the MERB chairwoman conveyed her understanding of existing operating procedures or rules, as distinguished from specific evidentiary facts. Even if the information was deemed &quot;factual,&quot; there was other sufficient competent evidence to support the MERB's decision. Finally, in relying on documentation that came into existence more than two years before the firing, the MERB properly interpreted Del. Merit R. 12.8 as not barring the use of &quot;old&quot; negative performance reviews in performance-based dismissals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to eight years in prison. The Superior Court in and for New Castle County (Delaware) denied her motion to reargue her challenge to her modified sentence, and she appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State said the supreme court had no jurisdiction to hear defendant's appeal since her notice of appeal did not specify sentencing orders. The supreme court disagreed because (1) she appealed the trial court's denial of reargument on her substantive claims, and (2) her reargument motion tolled the time to appeal the sentencing order, making her appeal timely, under Del. Sup. Ct. R. 6(a)(ii). A claim that it was error to find she did not offer the victim aid failed because, in modifying her sentence, the court found she offered aid and reduced her sentence. It was not an abuse of discretion to consider pictures of defendant drinking on her MySpace.com page because (1) the court found the pictures were posted before her crime, and (2) it was not error to consider her failure to remove them as an aggravating factor. Applying an &quot;undue depreciation&quot; aggravator was not error because (1) it was properly applied as to a defendant's state of mind, (2) sentencing guidelines applied it where less than total confinement would unduly depreciate a crime's seriousness, and (3) defendant's lack of remorse showed anything short of confinement would unduly depreciate her crime's gravity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for New Castle County, that enhanced his sentence for attempted second-degree burglary pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 825(b)(2) (2007); his attorney filed a motion to withdraw, and the State filed a motion to affirm the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant conceded that he was previously convicted of first-degree burglary and that his date of termination of incarceration for that conviction was July 13, 2006. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that defendant unquestionably committed the offense of attempted second-degree burglary within five years of the date of termination of the period of incarceration imposed for his previous burglary conviction. Contrary to defendant's argument, it was the date of the commission of the subsequent offense, not the date of conviction or the date of sentencing for that offense, that determined if &sect; 825(b)(2) applied. There was nothing ambiguous about the statute.&nbsp;Section 825(c) provided that the enhanced sentencing provision of &sect; 825(b) also applied to a conviction for attempted second-degree burglary. Moreover, defendant agreed as part of his plea agreement and during the plea colloquy that he was subject to the three-year minimum mandatory sentencing because of his prior conviction. He was bound by those admissions. Therefore, defendant's appeal was wholly without merit and devoid of any arguably appealable issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's motion was granted, the judgment was affirmed, and counsel's motion to withdraw was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and other crimes. Pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209(c)(3)(a)(2), the jury found during the sentence phase that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors. The Kent County Superior Court (Delaware) imposed a death sentence and, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and co-defendant fatally shot a man in front of his wife and child. The trial court found as aggravators, inter alia, defendant's commission of the murder during a robbery, his unapologetic criminality, and his threatening to harm those whom he told about the murder if they told police. He argued his counsel was ineffective for failing to present certain mitigation evidence at the penalty hearing. The high court disagreed. As the aggravators were overwhelming, and the new mitigators were cumulative, irrelevant, or detrimental to his mitigation case, defendant did not show a reasonable probability that the result of the penalty hearing would have been different with this mitigation evidence. The trial court properly found no prosecutorial misconduct during the penalty phase. As the trial judge's elimination of the phrases &quot;conscience of the community&quot; and &quot;great weight&quot; from the jury instructions did not undermine the jury's ability to perform its duty, defendant was not prejudiced from the claimed ineffective assistance of his counsel in not objecting to the instructions. Defendant's other challenges were procedurally barred by Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment denying defendant's motion for postconviction relief was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant strangled his girlfriend in her apartment, knowing she was pregnant with another man's child, he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.

Even if trial counsel's failures to object were deemed an unreasonably deficient performance, defendant did not show that he was prejudiced or that the outcome of his case would have been different had trial counsel objected. Because defendant did not raise his separate constitutional violation claims on his direct appeal, they were procedurally barred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for New Castle County, of Carrying a Concealed Deadly Weapon in violation Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1442. He appealed, arguing that &sect; 1442 was applied unconstitutionally as the Delaware Constitution contained an implicit right to carry concealed weapons on one's own property. He asserted that he had a right to carry a concealed weapon inside his own home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landlord informed defendant that he was being evicted. A Constable went to the residence to ensure it was clear. Defendant had testified that he was not living at the house at that time as he had moved out one to two weeks earlier. Rather, he was residing with his mother on the date of his arrest. While knocking on a closed door in the house, the Constable repeatedly yelled, &quot;State Constable, State Constable.&quot; Defendant opened the door. The Constable observed defendant lift up his t-shirt, remove a gun from the waistband of his jeans, and toss the gun away from him. The Constable arrested defendant. The appellate court held that defendant's claim that his carrying a concealed weapon conviction violated a right guaranteed by Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 was made for the first time on appeal and thus was waived as there was no showing of plain error. In addition, the record did not permit the appellate court to address the merits of the claim that the Delaware Constitutional right to bear arms restricted enforcement of Delaware's concealed carry statute, i.e., that there was a Delaware Constitutional &quot;home possession&quot; exception, as the house was no longer defendant's &quot;home.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Sussex County, defendant was convicted of capital murder, possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, and abuse of a corpse under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1332. He was sentenced to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that the trial court did not deny defendant his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to effective counsel by preventing defense counsel from pursuing a guilty but mentally ill verdict over defendant's objection. The ruling protected defendant's individual right to determine whether to present such a defense to the jury. With regard to &sect; 1332, a rational jury could conclude that the victim was dead when defendant took pictures of her. Defendant admitted that she was dead a few hours later. The condition of the apartment indicated a serious struggle. A neighbor testified that she heard loud banging noises and defendant's screams but did not hear the victim's voice, even though she had heard it during previous altercations. In weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, the trial court was not required to discuss each mitigating circumstance individually and in detail. Finally, the death sentence was not disproportionate under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209. It was similar to the results in other cases where the murder victim was a current or former lover; defendant seemed to have shown no remorse; and he had a prior conviction for aggravated assault of an ex-lover.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a capital case, appellant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County that denied his motions for postconviction relief and a new trial following his convictions of murder first degree (one count of intentional murder and two counts of felony murder), robbery first degree, burglary first degree, conspiracy second degree, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found appellant and a codefendant crashed through the patio doors of the victim's home and shot the victim to death in front of his wife and infant son. A jury recommended the death penalty. The supreme court found that appellant's claim under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 33 failed, as appellant had neither claimed nor shown that DNA evidence and evidence of a preexisting shoulder injury could not have been discovered before trial with due diligence, and he had not shown that that evidence, and a co-defendant's recantation, would have probably changed the result of the proceeding if presented to the jury. Appellant's claim of ineffective counsel under the Sixth Amendment also failed, as he had not carried his burden of showing a reasonable probability that he would have received a different sentence based upon the reconstructed record, as the weight of the aggravating circumstances, including a deadly intrusion into the victim's home and appellant's lack of remorse, overwhelmed the mitigating circumstances. Appellant also had not shown that defense counsel's performance was deficient in failing to attempt to rehabilitate prospective jurors or object to their dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a junior secured creditor (JSC) of a limited liability company (LLC), sought review of an order from the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, which dismissed its claims against appellees, the LLC's present and former managers both directly and derivatively, alleging breach of fiduciary duties, upon finding that it lacked standing to sue under Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 18-1002.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LLC had serious deficiencies in its accounting system, as well as various weaknesses and deficiencies in its internal controls. A consolidation of the LLC's billing, accounting, and other operations exacerbated its preexisting internal control deficits. The LLC eventually became insolvent, and its assets were liquidated in order to reduce its debt burden. The JSC alleged that it was not repaid any of the debt owed by the LLC. It filed its suit against the managers, alleging both direct and derivative claims of breach of fiduciary duties by them. The trial court dismissed all of the claims. It found that as the derivative claims required dismissal due to the JSC's lack of standing to sue thereon, the direct claim failed as well. On appeal, the court found that the derivative standing provisions of Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect;&sect; 18-1001 and 18-1002 precluded standing by the creditor, as it was not a member or assignee. The provisions of &sect; 18-1002 were clear and unambiguous, such that &sect; 18-1001 did not change the standing prohibition. Further, &sect; 18-1002 was constitutional under Del. Const. art. IV, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in the New Castle County Superior Court (Delaware) to two counts of assault in the second degree, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 612, two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1447A, and one count of reckless endangering in the first degree, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 604, and was sentenced to 31 years in prison, suspended after 24 years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said a sentence more severe than the Sentencing Accountability Commission guidelines recommended was error. The supreme court held there was no error because the sentencing judge found two aggravating circumstances justified departure, as (1) a guidelines sentence would unduly depreciate the crimes' seriousness, since defendant fired into an unarmed group, and (2) defendant did not accept responsibility when he gave an investigator an incredible version of the crimes. It was no error not to consider his apology or a victim's alleged instigation because the judge did not have to credit the apology or defendant's version of the crimes. The judge did not improperly consider defendant's later arrest on dismissed charges because the sentence was based on unrelated aggravating circumstances. Any error in reciting his vocational background did not require reversal as (1) counsel did not object, (2) defendant did not show how the judge erred, and (3) he showed no resulting prejudice. It was unnecessary to decide if certain charges were not &quot;lead&quot; charges, such that their sentence's enhancement erred, because the enhancement was based on the seriousness of defendant's conduct.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1447.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred as a matter of law in sentencing him not under the two year minimum, mandatory sentence set forth under &sect; 1447, but the five year minimum, mandatory sentence for third felonies under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1447A. Defendant received Miranda warnings and then admitted that he accidentally shot the victim in the head. He then pled guilty to manslaughter, PDWDCF, and possession of a deadly weapon by a person prohibited (PDWBPP). The sentencing judge sentenced him for the manslaughter, PDWDCF, and PDWBPP convictions. Although the written sentence order correctly identified the offense as PDWDCF, the sentence order then provided for a mandatory five year sentence and cited to a separate crime for which he was not indicted, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1447A. The appellate court could not presume that the citation to &sect; 1447A was a clerical error. Defendant should have been sentenced pursuant to the statutory provision that the indictment charged and to which he pled guilty, which was &sect; 1447.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence order was vacated. The matter was remanded for resentencing consistent with &sect; 1447.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adoptive mother and respondent, her former life partner, fought for custody of the child; neither was the child's biological mother. Based on Senate Bill 84 (SB 84), codified at Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 8-201, which was enacted in response to a high court ruling in the parties' prior litigation, the New Castle County Family Court (Delaware) awarded the parties joint legal and physical custody.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had held that respondent had standing to seek custody as a &quot;de facto parent.&quot; The high court had reversed, finding that Delaware's Uniform Parentage Act (DUPA), Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 8-101 et seq., did not recognize de facto parents. The legislature then enacted SB 84, which amended DUPA to include a de facto parent within the definition of &quot;parent.&quot; The high court held that SB 84 did not violate Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 16's &quot;single subject&quot; rule, as it dealt with the one subject identified in its title--parents. As SB 84 did not retroactively reverse the high court's prior decision, it did not violate the separation of powers principle. SB 84 neither infringed on appellant's due process rights nor offended the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Respondent's custody petition was not barred by collateral estoppel or res judicata, as SB 84  provided that these doctrines did not apply to a court's finding that Delaware did not recognize de facto parent status. As SB 84 expressly provided that it applied retroactively, the trial court properly considered events that occurred before its enactment in determining whether respondent was a de facto parent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged victim sued appellees, a school and a religious order, in the Superior Court in and for New Castle County (Delaware) for personal injuries, under the Child Victim Act (CVA), Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8145. A jury found the order, but not the school, negligent, but it did not find the order's negligence proximately caused the victim's injuries. The victim appealed, and the order cross appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim said it was error to exclude his expert. The supreme court agreed because (1) the testimony's probative value was not properly balanced, on the record, against the prejudice of excluding it, under Del. R. Evid. 403, and (2) it was relevant to proximate cause. A special verdict form asking if a defendant's act was &quot;the,&quot; instead of &quot;a,&quot; proximate cause of harm was not plain error because the entire instructions correctly stated the law. The CVA revived intentional tort claims because an intentional breach subsumed a grossly negligent breach required by the CVA. A violation of criminal laws in effect at the time of the alleged abuse had to be shown because (1) a sex crime was a predicate to a CVA gross negligence claim against an institutional defendant, and (2) due process barred a retroactive imposition of liability substantially changing liability existing at the time of the abuse. The CVA was not unconstitutional because a claim could be revived after a statute of limitation expired, unless the expiration created a property right. The order did not show the CVA violated due process as applied because it showed no actual prejudice from missing witnesses or evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that a police officer could stop a driver if the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion as to the commission of a civil traffic violation under Del.

Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4179(a) and (e)(2) by illegally parking in the roadway and blocking the entrance to a police captain's private driveway. A violation of &sect; 4179 was a civil traffic violation, punishable only by civil penalties. When the captain saw defendant illegally parking on the roadway in front of his driveway, he had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a violation of &sect; 4179 was occurring. Thus, under Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 801 and 802, the captain could conduct a traffic stop of defendant. During the stop, the captain properly asked defendant for his identification, registration, and insurance documents. While he was receiving that information, the captain smelled alcohol coming from defendant, which gave the captain a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was intoxicated. Defendant did not claim that &sect; 802 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County, which convicted him of 12 counts of unlawful sexual contact second degree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's son, who was 29, reported to the police that approximately two decades earlier, defendant had sexually assaulted him regularly. Defendant went to the police station voluntarily to speak with a detective, and he gave a taped statement. Although defendant admitted to some conduct, he adamantly denied other accusations. He was charged with multiple sex offenses. At trial, the only evidence presented was the testimony of defendant's son and defendant's taped statement. The jury returned a guilty verdict. On appeal, the court found that the limitation period that was applicable during the time of the criminal conduct did not bar defendant's prosecution. After Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 205(e) was amended, the prior limitations period of two years after reporting was extended to an unlimited duration for defendant's actions. There was no violation of the U.S. Constitution ex post facto clause because the limitations period had not expired. Further, the evidence was sufficient to support the guilty verdict, and to negate the claim that the son's testimony derived from memories recovered by psychotherapy. Accordingly, denial of defendant's acquittal motion was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County found defendant guilty of nine counts of assault in a detention facility, in violation of Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that &sect; 1254 violated equal protection principles by treating prisoners differently from non-prisoners. The high court held that as he had unsuccessfully raised this claim in prior appeal, it was without merit. He argued that the denial of his request for a continuance so that he could obtain a mental health evaluation was an abuse of discretion. As he had been afforded such an evaluation four months prior to the incidents in the case, and did not explain why a new evaluation was necessary, denial of a request for a new mental health evaluation was not error. As the trial court properly permitted him to be tried in absentia, but did not impinge upon his right to self-representation, his claim of a constitutional denial of his right to counsel was without any factual foundation or merit. As the sole basis for his claim that the trial judges who dealt with his case were biased against him appeared to be the fact that they made rulings adverse to him, which, standing alone, did not constitute a valid basis for disqualification on the ground of bias, this claim was meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for New Castle County, that convicted him of assault in a detention facility and second-degree assault; defendant's counsel filed a Del. Sup. Ct. R. 26(c) motion to withdraw, and the State filed a motion to affirm the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was incarcerated, he threw a mixture of hot water, urine, and feces at various correctional officers. Pursuant to Rule 26(c), the state supreme court found, inter alia, that because defendant's assaultive behavior occurred while the officers were performing lawful duties, there was no rational basis for the jury to acquit defendant of assault in a detention facility and convict him of a lesser-included offense. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on self-defense. The evidence was sufficient as a matter of law for the jury to convict defendant of second-degree assault. Because a juror indicated that her relationship to a correction officer would not affect her ability to render an impartial verdict, the trial court did not err in refusing to discharge her. There was no support for defendant's assertion that a court clerk manipulated the petit jury selection process. However, because the trial court only instructed the jury on the elements of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1254(c), it erred in sentencing defendant under &sect; 1254(a), and the case had to be remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed, the matter was remanded for resentencing, the State's motion to affirm was granted, and counsel's motion to withdraw was moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought reversal of is sentence on the basis that Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4201(c) was unconstitutional because there as no rational basis on which to classify a &quot;walk away&quot; escape as a violence felony and that the sentence violated the Eighth Amendment. The court disagreed. As to the constitutionality of &sect; 4201, the court noted that a convicted felon who failed to return to custody while on work release demonstrates, by his conduct, that it was a mistake to place him or her at that level of supervision. The assumption that such a criminal was safe to be in the community, likewise, would be negated. An escaped convict must find a place to hide in order to avoid recapture, and it would be reasonable to anticipate that a person in those circumstances might resort to violence or threats of violence. The court further concluded that the sentence was not grossly disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment, as defendant did not just walk away and return the next morning, but was at large until the police arrested him a week later.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court found, inter alia, that the postconviction court did not address the interest of justice or miscarriage of justice exceptions in Rule 61(i)(2), (4), (5). Therefore, a remand was necessary. Defendant's claim under the Delaware Constitution was moot. Although the evidence might not have supported the &quot;in furtherance of&quot; requirement for felony murder, the jury was properly instructed on the statutory aggravating factors in Del.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose out of defendant's possession of a bow and arrow. The issue was whether the bow and arrow was a &quot;deadly weapon.&quot; The appellate court found that the list of weapons in Del.

The fact finder could have reasonably concluded from the evidence that defendant himself understood that his bow and arrow was a &quot;deadly weapon&quot; that he should not have possessed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order by the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County that denied his Del. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 61 motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his standby counsel was ineffective, that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on a lesser-included offense, improperly conducting voir dire of a juror, and in denying his motion for bail modification, that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional, and that his sentence was disproportionately harsh. The state supreme court found, inter alia, that defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel and elected to proceed pro se at trial. Even assuming that he could properly assert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in such circumstances, the record did not support such a claim. Defendant's claims that the trial court erred by improperly instructing the jury and by improperly conducting voir dire of a juror, were previously adjudicated. Because defendant failed to raise his bail modification and statute constitutionality claims in his direct appeal, they were procedurally defaulted. Defendant's harshness claim could not be raised in a Rule 61 motion. Therefore, it was procedurally barred. Accordingly, defendant was not entitled to postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Newark, Del., Zoning Code &sect; 32-51(b), appellee board of adjustment upheld a city's eviction of a fraternity from its fraternity house after it was suspended by a state university, and upheld the termination of the grandfathered, non-conforming, pre-existing fraternity use of the property. Appellant property owners sought review. The Superior Court, New Castle County, Delaware, denied the owners' petition. They sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fraternity houses were non-conforming uses in the city. Under &sect; 32-51(b), a fraternity suspended by the university for over a year had to vacate the building; the building's use as a fraternity was terminated immediately upon suspension. The high court rejected the owners' claim that &sect; 32-51(b) unlawfully delegated the city's legislative function to the university. The university's suspension of the fraternity was neither a legislative nor a zoning decision, but a quasi-judicial act within the power entrusted to it by state law. The owners' due process right under U.S. Const. amend. XIV was not violated by their being deprived of the opportunity to argue before the board that the fraternity did not violate the university's regulations; they did not show that they were precluded from participating in the university's disciplinary proceedings, and the board had no right to retry those proceeding. Section 32-51(b) did not require suspension of the fraternity by a national organization, but was only concerned with action by the university. The subsequent lease of the property to another fraternity within a year did not, as a matter of law, operate to preserve the non-conforming use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that defense counsel violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment when counsel introduced evidence incriminating him and then argued that a competent defendant is &quot;guilty but mentally ill&quot; when he expressly objects to this strategy, asserts his factual innocence, denies mental illness, and so testifies before the jury. Defendant also claimed that the trial judge erred in failing to intervene when the conflict between defense counsel and defendant over the objectives of the representation so plainly appeared and defendant testifies that he &quot;fired&quot; his attorneys and &quot;I'm defending my own self.&quot; The supreme court concluded that defense counsel's strategy infringed upon defendant's personal and fundamental constitutional rights to plead not guilty, to testify in his own defense, and to have the contested issue of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt decided by an impartial jury. Defense counsel's conduct, and the trial court's refusal to intervene and provide a remedy, so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process contemplated by the Sixth Amendment and the Due Process Clause that the trial could not be relied upon as having produced a just result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant stemmed from a tragic shooting spree that unfolded across two states, in which defendant shot at numerous people, killing two, on in Maryland and on in Delaware. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court committee reversible error when it refused to exclude a doctor's psychiatric evaluation from the guilt and penalty phases of the trial, because the State violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel on the Delaware charges. The supreme court concluded that while the trial court violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right, the testimony was admissible under exceptions to the exclusionary rule, namely the independent source doctrine and the inevitable discovery doctrine. Defendant also argued that the aggravating factor used to elevate his life sentence to a sentence of death was improperly applied to his conduct. The supreme court disagreed, concluding that State properly relied on the Maryland death as a statutory aggravator under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209(e)(1)k, as the jury was instructed to find that defendant caused the Maryland death beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for New Castle County (Delaware) denied a motion for summary judgment filed by appellants, a radiologist and two professional corporations that provided radiology services (providers), in a medical malpractice action brought by appellees, a husband and his wife. The superior court granted the providers' application for a certificate of interlocutory appeal without objection by appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The providers claimed that the action was barred by the Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 6856 limitation period. The issue--whether the enactment of Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 6853 altered the application of the decisions in Dunn and Meekins to Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 6856--was one of first impression in Delaware. The court conducted a de novo review and found that (1) &sect; 6853 required a complaint alleging medical negligence to be accompanied by an affidavit of merit and did not toll the &sect; 6856 limitation period; (2) &sect; 6856 provided that a medical negligence claim had to be filed within two years from the date on which the injury occurred; (3) the wife's injury occurred on the date the radiologists failed to diagnose her cancer; (4) the wife filed her complaint after the limitations period expired; and (5) the failure to diagnose did not toll the running of the &sect; 6856 limitation period. The court concluded that the superior court erred when it determined that the date of injury was a question of fact for the jury. Based on the undisputed facts, summary judgment was appropriate because the complaint was filed after the limitation period for medical negligence claims expired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the interlocutory summary judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As surveillance video showed a brief struggle between defendant and another individual but did not conclusively establish that the individual attempted to steal defendant's car, there was sufficient evidence to support an acquittal of a first degree robbery charge and a conviction of the lesser included offense of offensive touching. The trial judge failed to accord defendant the full benefit of the reasonable doubt standard by refusing his request for a lesser included offense instruction on offensive touching. Defendant's 2001 conviction for forgery second was a conviction for purposes of the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214(a), and the unavailability of a direct appeal did not change this result. Defendant could have asserted his federal rights in state court through a motion for post conviction relief or a writ of certiorari. Ex parte communications between the trial judge and the jury did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, as the communications occurred before jury deliberations. The trial judge engaged the jury to resolve purely ministerial matters, and these exchanges did not address any substantive issues of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court stayed the case pending the disposition of certified questions of law in another case. In that case, the supreme court determined that &sect; 4176A was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant conceded that that case foreclosed his argument that &sect; 4176A was unconstitutionally vague. Therefore, he argued that &sect; 4176A violated due process because it imposed a substantial penalty upon persons who lacked any intent to commit a crime. On ripeness grounds, the supreme court declined to accept the parties' invitation to determine whether a potential 30 month sentence under &sect; 4176A violated due process. Defendant had not been tried, convicted, and sentenced. Because &sect; 4176A did not set a mandatory minimum sentence, the State could recommend a sentence within the 30 month range, and the trial court had leeway to sentence within that range. That weighed against reaching the merits of the case because the facts were not fully developed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant's vehicle for a violation of Wilmington, Del., Code &sect; 11-60(c)(2)(a)(4), a noise ordinance. The officer arrested defendant after he found that his license was suspended. At the police station, the officer found drugs in defendant's jacket. Defendant argued that the stop was unlawful. The State did not contest that &sect; 11-60(c)(2)(a)(4) was ambiguous, but defendant's claim that the alleged unconstitutionality of the ordinance required suppression of the evidence was waived. Defendant conceded at his suppression hearing that the alleged unconstitutionality of the ordinance had no bearing on his motion to suppress. Defendant also argued that because the officer did not understand precisely what the ordinance required, he was stopped without an articulable suspicion of criminal activity. However, the appellate court found that, although the officer was unable to recite the ordinance verbatim, he knew that it contained a 50-foot standard in determining a noise disturbance. Because the officer heard defendant's music from 300 feet away, he had proper grounds to stop defendant. The resulting arrest for driving on a suspended license and search were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxpayer, an automobile manufacturer, challenged a determination by respondent Director of Revenue that under the Wholesalers' Gross Receipts Tax, the Director could lawfully impose an unapportioned tax on the taxpayer's receipts from sales of motor vehicles sold to independent dealerships in Delaware. The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County affirmed the determination. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the statute violated the Commerce Clause. It posed no risk of impermissible multiple taxation, for Del. Code Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 2902 applied only to gross receipts from sales of tangible personal property physically delivered within Delaware. Thus, the tax was not out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted in the state. Next, the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce. The tax treated any wholesaler engaged in wholesaling in Delaware the same; all had to pay a tax on the gross receipts from wholesaling without regard to where or how the goods were manufactured or assembled. This gave Delaware wholesalers no advantage over out-of-state wholesalers. Both paid a tax on the gross receipts on goods physically delivered to customers in Delaware. Finally, there was no merit to the taxpayer's claim that the tax was applied to vehicles physically delivered outside of Delaware. While the taxpayer did not technically own the vehicles following gate release, it controlled their ultimate delivery in Delaware, reimbursed dealers for damage, and carried insurance for the cost of repair of any damage after gate release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Code Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 1411. There was a sufficient nexus between the teacher's sexual relationship with a former student and the teacher's fitness to teach. The relationship began in the school environment, and involved a 17-year-old sibling of a student who attended the teacher's school. There was a public controversy following the teacher's arrest and the disclosure of the relationship. Part of the teacher's job was to serve as a role model. The board could reasonably conclude that the relationship itself threatened the teacher's function of serving as a role model. The public disclosure of the relationship permitted the board to infer a significant detrimental impact on the school community if the teacher continued to teach. There was substantial evidence from which the board could conclude that the teacher's actions threatened the moral and social fabric of the school environment, and evinced a serious lack of judgment that was far below the standard of such judgment acceptable for teachers employed by the district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of third-degree burglary, the trial court declared him to be a habitual offender and sentenced him to a total period of 12 years at Level V incarceration, to be suspended after serving 10 years for decreasing levels of supervision. The state supreme court found the substance of defendant's brief to be that his counsel was ineffective by failing to investigate the defense of involuntary intoxication. Even if defendant were under the influence of medication at the time he committed the charged offenses, there was no evidence that he was unable to form the intent to commit the crimes. Accordingly, there was no support for defendant's claim that counsel failed to investigate an involuntary intoxication defense. Moreover, defendant was bound by his sworn representations in his plea. Although the trial court incorrectly concluded that defendant did not raise his challenge on direct appeal, defendant could not avoid the procedural bar of Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i)(4) by refining or restating the claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for New Castle County, with operation of a motor vehicle causing death under Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4176A. Upon the State's motion, the court certified the following questions: (1) Do the general liability provisions of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 251(b) apply to Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4176A?; and (2) Is Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4176A&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4176A clearly evidenced the General Assembly's intent to create an offense premised on a lower level of culpability than criminal negligence, which was required for convictions under Delaware's criminal homicide and manslaughter statutes. Accordingly, an application of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 251(b) would have defeated the legislative purpose of establishing a lower level of culpability. Therefore, the general liability provisions of &sect; 251(b) did not apply because a violation of &sect; 4176A was an offense defined by a statute other than the Criminal Code and the General Assembly's intent to impose strict liability for deaths proximity caused by a moving violation of the Motor Vehicle Code plainly appeared in both the unambiguous language of the statute and its legislative history. The absence of a state of mind requirement in Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4176A did not make the statute void for vagueness. Moreover, the terms of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4176A were sufficiently explicit to give a person of common intelligence notice of the proscribed conduct. Thus, the statute as written was unambiguous and not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions in the negative and remanded the matter to the superior court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of first-degree robbery and was sentenced as a habitual offender to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Defendant claimed, inter alia, that his habitual offender sentence was illegal as disproportionate under the U.S. Const. amend.

The state supreme court found that defendant did not dispute that he had the requisite number of qualifying convictions to support the State's petition for habitual offender status under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214(b). Defendant's claim that his sentence was unconstitutional and, therefore, illegal under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35(a) was without merit since &sect; 4214(b) had been found constitutional. In the absence of an abuse of discretion by the trial court, defendant's claim that a hearing on his postconviction motion was required was without merit. While the trial court used a form order to decide defendant's motion, it provided the rationale for its decision on the blank line on the form, as it was required to do by Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile appealed his adjudication as delinquent on the ground that he only attempted to engage in consensual intercourse with the victim. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying a motion for a judgment of acquittal of attempted rape in the second degree. The evidence was sufficient to show that the juvenile acted without the victim's consent under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 761(i) because he entered her bedroom uninvited, shut the door behind him, pushed her against the bed, and got on top of her, although she repeatedly told him to stop, resisted his advances and, after 15 minutes, found the strength to push him off of her. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to show that the juvenile engaged in substantial steps toward having intercourse with the victim because he told her that &quot;he just wanted it and needed it,&quot; unbuttoned his pants, tried to unbutton her pants, and put his hand over her bra and down her pants. The court held that the trial court correctly applied Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 4120 and 4121, which did not conflict with Del.

He argued that the probation officers violated Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4321 and Parole and Procedure 7.19 when they decided to search his home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was on probation and was forbidden from possessing a weapon. A police officer received an anonymous tip from an unknown caller, who told him that he suspected drug activity at defendant's house. The police officer contacted the probation officers. They conducted an administrative search of defendant's home and found a revolver. The supreme court held that the probation officers improperly relied on conclusory, inconsistent, and unreliable information that could not sustain a reasonable suspicion to search the home. Under Procedure 7.19 probation officers had to rationally assess the facts made known to them before reaching the critical conclusion that there was a reasonable basis to search a probationer's dwelling. The police officer's communicating the caller's conclusory opinion that defendant was involved in drug activity did not provide the probation officers with sufficient detail to support a conclusion that there was a reasonable basis to suspect that defendant was involved in drug activity. The information was inconsistent with the further, follow up investigation. Without reasonable suspicion, the unlawfully seized evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment of the superior court, vacated defendant's conviction, and remanded the case for proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for New Castle County, found defendant guilty but mentally ill of murder and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony. On appeal, defendant claimed that imposition of a sentence of life without parole on a defendant who, at the age of 15-3/4 years, killed his 9-year-old cousin was disproportionate as violating either Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 or U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the State met its burden to prove murder in the first degree (Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 636) where the evidence established that defendant's attack on his cousin was prolonged, starting with strangulation and ending with a vicious knife attack. Regardless of whether the trial judge accepted the defense experts' opinions that defendant was guilty but mentally ill (as a subset of their insanity opinions) as a result of schizophrenia, or the State's expert's tacit acknowledgment that he was guilty but mentally ill (as a result of ongoing conduct disorder), it was enough that the trial judge found defendant's condition fit within one of the three bases set forth in Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 401(b), and the verdict would have been the same. As to the sentence, the court concluded that the United States Supreme Court, in Roper, would not have recognized a sentence of life without parole as an acceptable alternative to death as a punishment for juveniles who commit intentional murder in the first degree, if such a sentence violated the Eighth Amendment. The court held that defendant's argument to the contrary was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was sentenced to the death penalty, appealed a decision from the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County denying his second motion for postconviction relief and his motion for the assigned judge to disqualify herself. Defendant had been convicted of murder first degree and related felonies in the shooting death of his girlfriend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original trial judge, although admittedly inclined to impose a life sentence, imposed the death penalty after the jury voted 10-2 in favor of execution. On appeal, the court applied the Los v. Los standard and held that the current trial judge was not demonstrably hostile toward or biased against defense counsel and that defendant's motion to disqualify the judge was properly denied. Neither the judge's comment when denying defendant's postconviction motion--that defense counsel was developing a pattern of attacking trial judges in death penalty cases--nor the judge's denial of counsel's request to extend the briefing schedule and page limits were sufficient to show bias or require recusal. Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was procedurally barred under the interests of justice exception in Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i)(4). The original trial judge did not have improper extrajudicial contact with jurors after the trial but prior to sentencing. The judge's encountering a juror on the street and informing him of defendant's sentencing date was not prejudicial. Nor did the original judge give undue statutory weight to the jury's sentencing recommendation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal, a jury in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County found defendant guilty of two counts of knowingly or intentionally using an expired registration number in the course of prescribing a controlled substance, in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 4756(a)(2). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a nurse practitioner, wrote two prescriptions to an undercover detective for a controlled substance used to treat pain. Defendant told the detective to fill the prescriptions in Maryland. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a judgment of acquittal because there was insufficient evidence to find her guilty of &quot;using&quot; an expired &quot;registration number,&quot; and that Del. Code Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 4756(a)(2) was unconstitutionally vague. The supreme court found no error in the denial of defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal, as there was undisputed evidence that defendant's Delaware registration had expired because defendant failed to request a timely renewal before defendant wrote the undercover detective a prescription. Defendant's contention that using an expired registration was different from using an expired registration number, which was not listed on the prescription, lacked merit. The supreme court declined to review defendant's claim that &sect; 4756(a)(2) was unconstitutionally vague, as defendant failed to raise it below. The supreme court also noted that even if it were to review the claim, it would find no plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a final judgment of conviction entered by the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County. A jury found him guilty of robbery, wearing a disguise during the commission of a felony, and conspiracy. Defendant claimed that the admission of a co-conspirator's redacted plea agreement impermissibly deprived him of his rights under the Confrontation Clause. He also challenged other evidentiary rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that by redacting the sentence recommendation from the co-conspirator's plea agreement, his right to cross-examine the co-conspirator about potential bias was infringed. Although no Delaware cases were on point, the Third Circuit held in almost identical circumstances that a defendant may inform the jury of the fact that a witness received prosecutorial leniency for his testimony, but also of the concrete details of the witness' agreement with the government. The specifics of the co-conspirator's plea agreement would have been an appropriate subject of cross-examination, and the State's interest in withholding the information was outweighed by defendant's constitutional rights. Precluding defendant from exploring the co-conspirator's motive for testifying was not harmless error because the co-conspirator was the State's key witness; his testimony was the only evidence of motive for the robberies and the most persuasive identification of defendant. Testimony as to his motive to testify could have decisively influenced the jury. Defendant's other evidentiary claims did not rise to the level of plain error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to defendant's claim of error regarding the violation of his rights under the Confrontation Clause, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. The court affirmed as to the other claims of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in the vehicle that was stopped when the driver failed to use a turn signal when entering a public highway from a parking lot on private property that was known for criminal activity. Defendant claimed that the stop violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 because the police did not have probable cause to stop the vehicle for a traffic violation. The court agreed. The arresting officer's affidavit in support of the search warrant showed that the stop was only based on the turn signal violation. The superior court's reliance on extra-affidavit considerations (high crime area, vehicle registration issues, etc.) was counter to the purpose of the &quot;four corners&quot; test. There was no factual basis to establish probable cause to stop the vehicle for a traffic violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4155(a) and (b) because the section did not apply. But for the improper stop, the officer would have had no contact with its occupants and thus, would not have had an opportunity to see the drugs on the driver's seat and in the center console.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Sussex County denied defendant's fifth motion for correction of an illegal sentence pursuant to Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35(a). Defendant appealed from the order, and the State moved to affirm on grounds that the appeal lacked merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the 1995 legislative amendments to Del. Code Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 4177(d)(4) constituted an unconstitutional enhancement of the punishments for multiple DUI convictions because they included as part of the calculation those convictions that predated enactment of the amendments. Thus, he argued that his 2005 sentence as a fourth-time offender violated the Delaware and federal constitutional prohibitions on ex post facto laws because said sentence took into account his two pre-1995 DUI's. But, the instant court held that his claim failed on both procedural and substantive grounds. First, because he provided no evidence that his guilty plea was involuntary, his voluntary plea operated as a waiver of any alleged errors occurring prior to the entry of the plea. Hence, he waived any constitutional violation as a procedural matter. Second, &sect; 4177(d)(4) did not operate as an ex post facto law, because the punishment for defendant's previous DUI's was not enhanced. His sentence as a fourth offender was not a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes, but was a stiffened penalty imposed against an aggravated offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment entered against defendant was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bank challenged the order of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, which affirmed a decision by appellee, the State Bank Commissioner, which assessed additional franchise tax and penalties against the bank for the tax years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. The additional franchise tax was assessed under Del. Code Ann. tit. 5, &sect; 1101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank's main contention on appeal was that the Commissioner and the trial court reversibly erred by concluding that it was domiciled in Delaware and, thus, subject to &sect; 1101(a). The bank asserted that it was domiciled in the State of New York because most of its employees, including its senior management, worked in New York. Therefore, the bank claimed that the applicable franchise tax provision was not &sect; 1101(a), but &sect;&nbsp;1101(b), under which only the income attributable to a Delaware branch was subject to tax. The court upheld the determination that the bank was domiciled in Delaware for franchise tax purposes and, therefore, &sect;&nbsp;1101(a) applied. The court also upheld the determination that the bank was not entitled to a Line 4(b) deduction under &sect; 1101(a) since no federally approved subsidiaries or branches existing precluded the bank from taking advantage of the deduction. The court did find that the Commissioner failed to consider any of the circumstances relating to abatement and, as such, abused his discretion by refusing to abate, in an appropriate way, the penalties assessed. The court upheld the constitutionality of the tax imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, in part, the portion of the order upholding the imposition of the additional franchise tax and reversed, in part, the portion of the order upholding the assessment of penalties. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions for it to remand the case to the Commissioner to reconsider the bank's request for abatement of penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of burglary in the third degree, in exchange for which the State dismissed additional charges. The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County declared defendant to be a habitual offender  and sentenced him to a total of 12 years at level V, to be suspended after 10 years for decreasing levels of supervision. Defendant appealed. The State moved to affirm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that a restitution order issued in Pennsylvania precluded his Delaware burglary convictions on double jeopardy grounds. The appellate court held that a voluntary guilty plea constituted a waiver of any alleged errors or defects occurring prior to the entry of the plea. The transcript of defendant's guilty plea colloquy reflected that his guilty plea was voluntary. As such, defendant waived his claim of a double jeopardy violation. Considering Delaware's legitimate public policy interest in punishing and deterring habitual offenders, the sentencing judge's discretion to sentence within the maximum statutory range, and defendant's actual sentence relative to the maximum sentence available under the statute, defendant's sentence did not raise an inference of disproportionality. Contrary to defendant's claim, the sentencing transcript reflected that defendant's attorney made a lengthy presentation regarding the mitigating factors in the case, including defendant's relapse into drug addiction, but that the trial court, within its discretion, simply did not accept those arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's motion to affirm was granted. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Family Court of the State of Delaware in and for Sussex County, which convicted him of delinquency counts of terroristic threatening under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 621(a)(1), and committing a hate crime under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1304(a)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Caucasian defendant made racially derogatory threats of physical harm to his African-American high school teacher. Defendant claimed that his statements were not a serious expression of intent to inflict bodily harm, that he uttered them merely to make the victim stop disciplining him, and that they were protected speech under the First Amendment. The trial court disagreed, applying the true threat exception to First Amendment protection. Deciding issues of first impression on appeal, the court held that the true threat doctrine was not restricted to political speech. The key inquiry was whether defendant intended to intimidate the teacher, not whether he intended to carry out the threat. Additionally, the phrase &quot;intentionally selects&quot; in the hate crime statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1304(a)(2), required a speaker to both (1) select the words and (2) select the person to whom the speaker directed those words. The State proved that defendant selected the teacher as a hate crime victim because of his race and  intentionally directed threats at the victim, rather than to a Caucasian teacher who was also present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court correctly denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on his conviction for second degree conspiracy where the State presented evidence that defendant's girlfriend intended to promote or facilitate his felony offenses. Specifically, defendant's girlfriend lived with him and was fully aware of his activities. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of four counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony where the guns and drugs were all found in the same location, inside a handbag in the trunk of the vehicle. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that, at the time defendant committed the felony offenses charged, the guns were within his immediate reach and, therefore, were readily accessible. The State presented sufficient evidence to support defendant's adjudication as a habitual offender under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214(a) where the State offered supporting documentation of prior predicate convictions and called an expert witness to testify. Thus, the superior court acted within its discretion in enhancing the sentence to 145 years minimum mandatory term of incarceration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of 28 counts of the sale of unregistered securities and one count of sale by an unregistered agent. At a second sentencing hearing, where defendant was represented by a public defender, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for New Castle County, sentenced defendant to five and one-half years, followed by probation, and ordered defendant to pay restitution. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial judge violated defendant's right to a fair trial when the trial judge permitted the State to introduce an expert's legal opinion on the meaning of the term &quot;security,&quot; as defined in the Delaware Code. Because defendant failed to object at trial, the supreme court reviewed defendant's contention for plain error and determined that defense counsel's conduct affirmatively demonstrated a decision not to object to the trial testimony of the subject witness. Defendant also contended that the statutory definition of &quot;security&quot; was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. Defendant claimed that he was not given fair notice that it was illegal to sell foreign certificates of deposit and stock without registering to sell securities. The supreme court found no merit in defendant's contention, noting, inter alia, that defendant was a licensed insurance agent who knew that he was not permitted to sell securities, that defendant voluntarily signed a cease and desist order agreeing not to sell unregistered securities, and that defendant's behavior exhibited knowledge that he should not have been selling the offshore products.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County for six counts of Sexual Exploitation of a Child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that an internet service provider (ISP) username was sufficient to establish a nexus between defendant's residence and computer and an intercepted image of child pornography to provide probable cause for a search warrant. The username, together with a billing address linking defendant to that name, the fact that defendant was traced to his address through driving records, and the fact that he was the principal in a computer business with a drop box as the listed address, provided a substantial basis to conclude that a fair probability existed that there was a computer in defendant's residence upon which child pornography might be found. Interpreting Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1108 to criminalize each act of creating a visual depiction rather than each &quot;photo session&quot; did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1103 each separate photograph, motion picture, or digitally created image was a single &quot;visual depiction.&quot; The legislature could have rationally concluded that to deter proliferation of child pornography it should focus on the number of visual depictions rather than their content or their method of creation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Sussex County jury convicted defendant of Second Degree Murder, First Degree Murder, two counts of First Degree Robbery, Second Degree Conspiracy, and several counts of Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the prosecution improperly informed the jury that it was their duty to find the truth in the case and that this was a misstatement of the law as it related to reasonable doubt. The supreme court found that the comments did not admonish the jury to disregard reasonable doubt as the standard of proof. The court could not conclude that the prosecutor's isolated use of the statement &quot;duty to find the truth,&quot; without more, intentionally or inferentially urged the jury to abandon reasonable doubt as the standard that governed their resolution of the charges. Accordingly, the comments were not improper. Defendant failed to articulate how the jury venire's brief, incidental viewing of him in handcuffs caused any prejudice, and also could not demonstrate that any members of the venire who saw him in handcuffs were actually seated on the jury. Defendant was not entitled to a justification instruction pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 464(a), as under defendant's version of the facts he had committed no crime for which he was charged, nor did he act intending to promote or facilitate the robbery or murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County convicted defendant of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death, both of which were affirmed on appeal. After defendant's petition for certiorari review was denied, he filed a motion for post-conviction relief, which was also denied. Defendant appealed this final ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his appeal, defendant raised three of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. He also claimed that the death penalty statute under which he was sentenced (the 1991 statute) was facially unconstitutional, or unconstitutional as applied to him, and that double jeopardy barred a new penalty hearing. The appeals court first held that trial counsel made a professionally reasonable decision in stipulating with the prosecutor to exchange unfavorable hearsay for favorable hearsay and to rely on the court's limiting instructions. Second, defendant opened the door to the cross examination that he challenged, and counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the same. However, a constitutional flaw existed in applying the 1991 statute to defendant. Because Delaware law required that the elements of any criminal offense, including capital murder, had to be found by a unanimous jury, and defendant's eligibility for the death penalty was decided by the sentencing judge only, that sentence had to be vacated. Further, double jeopardy did not bar a resentencing in compliance with Ring as the jury's penalty recommendation under the 1991 statute did not operate as an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the Superior Court denying defendant's postconviction relief petition was reversed, and the death sentence imposed was vacated. The matter was thus remanded for a new penalty hearing and resentencing complying with the holding in Ring v. Arizona. However, the judgment of the Superior Court denying defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County, after defendant's guilty plea, had convicted him of Violation of Privacy (VOP) and had sentenced him to the statutory maximum of two years confinement at Level V for that crime. The trial court denied defendant's motion to modify his sentence for VOP. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court also convicted and sentenced defendant to five counts of Unlawful Dealing in Child Pornography, in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1109, and one count of Interception of Communications, in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 2402. Under a search warrant, the police found the pornographic material reported by defendant's wife as well as recording devices, audiotapes, and hidden cameras. The police found a videotape depicting the wife's 14-year-old daughter naked. The wife's daughter testified about the lasting impact of defendant's recording her. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in finding aggravating circumstances and erred under the Sixth Amendment by enhancing his sentence based upon those aggravating circumstances that it, rather than a jury, had found. The highest court restated that its standard of review was limited to a determination of whether the sentence was within the statutory limits. Therefore, neither Apprendi nor Blakely's Sixth Amendment holdings applied since Delaware's sentencing guidelines were of a voluntary and nonbinding nature. The two-year VOP sentence that defendant received was within the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

In any event, defendant did not show that consideration of the claims was warranted in the interest of justice and did not establish a colorable claim that there was a miscarriage of justice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions and resulting death sentence, alleging eight procedural and constitutional defects in the voir dire, trial, and penalty phases of the proceedings. While the appeals court found that the trial judge acted within his discretion, and did not otherwise err, during jury selection, during the guilt phase, or while instructing the jury at the penalty phase, the court held that because the trial judge recited in his sentencing opinion that he was directed to give great weight to the jury's recommendation in his sentencing decision, contrary to the strictures of Delaware's death-penalty statute, defendant's death sentence was vacated, and the matter was remanded for reconsideration under the appropriate standard as outlined in the legislature's amendment to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect;&nbsp;4209. However, because the trial judge instructed the jury on the correct standard and the error occurred after the jury made its recommendation, the error's effects were limited solely to the trial judge's final sentencing decision and did not affect the jury's findings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the superior court sentencing defendant to death was vacated, and the matter was remanded for resentencing under the appropriate standard.

The appeals court found that the sentence exceeded the sentence imposed after his first violation of probation that included a reduction of his original suspended sentence of incarceration. Second, because the parties agreed that the imposition of defendant's sentence was not suspended, but rather the execution of his sentence was, the phrase in the statute which stated that the trial court could impose any sentence which might originally have been imposed if the imposition of a sentence was suspended did not apply. Further, when defendant was found in violation of his probation for the second time, the Superior Court had the authority to impose a Level V sentence up to the balance of the suspended sentence then in effect. Because the maximum sentence at Level V which was available, was one year and ten months, the Superior Court erred when it imposed more Level V time than remained on defendant's suspended Level V sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After portions of his land were eroded by storms, defendant erected a barrier with bags of concrete and sand without a permit. Defendant was convicted, and he sought review. In affirming, the court determined that Del. Code Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 6604 was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it did not regulate conduct that was constitutionally protected. In addition, it was not unconstitutionally vague because a reasonable person in defendant's position would have understood that the concrete barrier in question constituted &quot;construction&quot; for which a permit was required. Also, there were minimum guidelines for enforcement. Next, the superior court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence. An official's conduct was not constrained by Del. Code Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 6616 because he was not conducting an administrative spot check. Rather, the plain view exception to the warrant requirement applied. Evidence regarding the distribution of sandbags was not relevant on whether the barrier violated the Act. Finally, a jury instruction was properly excluded because the State was not required to prove that defendant was aware that his conduct was violating a statute.</SPAN></P>

While sitting in the victim's van during the transaction, defendant pointed a gun at the victim. The victim exited the van. Defendant and his companion both fired at the victim, who returned fire. One of the gunshots struck and killed the victim. The appellate court ruled that if a crime contained a statutory element that another crime did not, the two offenses were not the &quot;same&quot; for double jeopardy purposes. Because the statute defining second degree murder, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 635(1), contained an element that the felony murder statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 636(a)(2), did not, namely, that defendant's actions indicated a cruel, wicked, and depraved indifference for human life, convictions of both crimes did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant inmate of rape in the first degree, and he was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. The inmate filed a motion for post-conviction relief claiming that his sentence was illegal. The Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for Kent County, denied the inmate's motion. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the pendency of the instant appeal, 75 Del. Laws c. 1, &sect; 1 (House Bill 31) was enacted. Among other things, 75 Del. Laws c. 1, &sect; 1 declared a prior decision of the Delaware Supreme Court in the instant proceeding to be null and void. The supreme court held that House Bill 31 was unconstitutional in its entirety, noting that, inter alia, the legislation violated Del. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect;1 and 11, and the single subject and title provisions of Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 16. The substantive issue before the supreme court was whether the life sentence being served by the inmate made him eligible for release from incarceration only if parole was granted. The inmate argued that judicial precedent required that his life sentence be calculated as a 45-year term for purposes of determining his qualification for conditional release. The supreme court disagreed and concluded that the inmate's life sentence was a natural life sentence with the possibility of parole and that, therefore, the inmate's release date was death unless he was granted parole. Thus, the inmate was not eligible for conditional release.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Division of Family Services filed a petition to terminate appellant mother's parental rights to her son. The Family Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County terminated the mother's parental rights after concluding that the Division had proved by clear and convincing evidence the statutory requirements for termination under Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1103(a)(6). The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother claimed that Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1103(a)(6) violated her right to due process of law because it created a presumption that she was unfit to parent any child presently or in the future, solely because her parental rights to her older children were previously terminated. The mother argued that by establishing that prior termination as a basis for terminating her rights to a different child, &sect; 1103(a)(6) violated procedural due process by denying her the opportunity to show that despite the prior termination, she is fit to continue as her child's parent. The supreme court concluded the statute did not deny her that opportunity. By requiring the Division to prove by clear and convincing evidence that termination was in the child's best interest, &sect; 1103(a)(6) protected against an erroneous deprivation of parental rights. In addition, the supreme court noted that the evidence showed that, despite the reunification services offered by the Division, the mother failed to cooperate and that termination was in the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>

A jury in the Superior Court of Delaware, in and for Kent County, convicted him of Murder in the First Degree, Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony and Arson in the Second Degree. Following a penalty hearing, the jury recommend a sentence of death. The trial judge sentenced defendant to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was defendant's girlfriend. The supreme court found the voir dire was adequate for the trial judge to ascertain whether each prospective juror would be impartial, and sufficient to enable defendant's attorney to evaluate each prospective juror for the purpose of either moving to excuse a juror for cause or exercising a peremptory challenge. The trial judge properly exercised his discretion in admitting the State's videotape, photographs of the victim, and autopsy slides into evidence, and in denying defendant's motion for a new penalty hearing. To the extent the defense wanted to present the victim's daughter's testimony in opposition to the death penalty to the jury, such testimony was inadmissible. Delaware's hybrid form of sentencing, allowing the jury to find a defendant death eligible and then allowing a judge to impose the death penalty, was not contrary to the Sixth Amendment as construed in Apprendi or Ring. Finally, the statutory form of Delaware's capital sentencing procedure comported with Blakely and Booker, and the death sentence was the product of a deliberate, rational, and logical deductive process, and was not imposed arbitrarily or capriciously.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying convictions and judgments of the Superior Court, including the sentence of death, were affirmed. The matter was remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, which convicted defendant of sexual solicitation of a child, in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 1112A(a)(1). Defendant was sentenced to serve five years at Level 5, suspended after one year for four years at Level 3 probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from him forcing a 15-year-old girl into his car after he unsuccessfully propositioned her. A police officer noticed the pair in the parked car and inquired of their ages. Defendant was over 50. On appeal, defendant asserted plain error and argued that the statute delineating the crime was unconstitutional under First Amendment principles regulating obscenity, because it lacked a state-of-mind requirement regarding age. In the alternative, he argued that, if it was constitutional, the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that the State had to prove his knowledge of the victim's age. The court found no constitutional infirmity with the statute and no error by the trial judge in instructing the jury. The court noted that, pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 762(a), defendant's alleged mistake as to the victim's age was no defense and that denying such a defense constituted a proper exercise of the State of Delaware's police power to protect children from sexual predators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant stationed with his wife at Dover Air Force Base. He learned that effective November 1, 2001, the Air Force would provide $ 100,000 life insurance for military spouses. He was having an affair, and he told his girlfriend that she should plan to move in with him November 5, 2001 because his wife was preparing to move out. In truth, his wife was not planning to move out; instead, defendant murdered her on November 3, 2001, by shooting her in the head in a Wal-Mart parking lot. Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that there was no constitutional deficiency in Delaware's sentencing framework because a bifurcated penalty hearing was not required by either federal or Delaware constitutionally prescribed due process, nor by Delaware statute. Therefore, the court found no error in the trial judge's denial of the motion to bifurcate defendant's sentencing hearing. The court compared Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209 with Maryland's sentencing statute and noted that Maryland did not give a trial judge discretion to grant a bifurcated hearing but that &sect; 4209 did not forbid the practice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction on jury verdict, in the Superior Court, Sussex County (Delaware), of various offenses, including securities violations, arising out of a land investment transaction. He argued that the evidence did not support securities violations, and that his guarantees against cruel and unusual punishment, denial of a speedy trial, and excessive bail had been violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant gave the victim a note, secured by stock in his valueless land development company, in exchange for a large check that he cashed immediately. The high court held that the context of the transaction showed that the note qualified as a security within the meaning of Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 7302(a)(13), making defendant subject to state securities laws. It was not necessary to consider whether defendant's 14-year sentence was grossly disproportionate because he was not sentenced as a habitual offender. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the stiff sentence given defendant's long criminal history and serious economic crimes. Most of the delays in defendant's second trial were due to his own activity, and he failed to show any resulting prejudice from the delay, so there was no speedy trial violation. Finally, defendant's initially very high bail was substantially reduced, but he was still unable to make it. The high court did not find the final bail amount to have been an abuse of discretion, based as it was on customary factors, and because defendant failed to show that he had to be at liberty in order to assist in preparing his defense.</SPAN></P>

Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, he was bound by those representations. His voluntary guilty plea waived any alleged defects or errors occurring before the entry of the plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of one count of intentional murder, one count of felony murder, and various robbery and weapons charges. In the penalty phase, the jury voted 10-2 in favor of life imprisonment for the intentional murder count, and 9-3 in favor of life for the felony murder count. The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County imposed the death penalty, both after trial and after remand. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Delaware's 1991 death penalty statute implicated the Tedder standard imported from the Florida law upon which the Delaware statute was based. On appeal, the issue was how that standard should have been applied. The state supreme court found that the trial court reevaluated the reasonableness of its own decision and concluded that there was record support for the imposition of a death sentence. However, the Tedder standard was not directed at the trial court's reasoning. Rather, it required that the trial court evaluate the jury's decision and determine whether there was any evidence to sustain the jury's conclusion. When the facts were analyzed from this perspective, the jury's recommendation to spare defendant's life should have been upheld. Ten of the 12 jurors recommended life without parole based on the following facts: (1) the shooting was not planned; (2) defendant suffered a childhood illness that negatively affected his development and resulted in a personality disorder; (3) defendant had a decent work history; (4) defendant had a positive relationship with his girlfriend and her children; and (5) defendant's accomplice was given a plea bargain and received a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court imposing a death sentence was reversed, and the matter was remanded for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of probation and parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court found that while a conviction for second-degree forgery carried a maximum sentence of two years, defendant's 10-year sentence was based on his habitual offender status under Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214. The sentence was at the low end of the sentencing spectrum for habitual offenders. Therefore, considering Delaware's legitimate public-safety interest in punishing and deterring habitual offenders, the sentencing judge's discretion to sentence within the maximum statutory range applicable to habitual offenders, and defendant's actual sentence relative to the maximum sentence available under the statute, there could be no inference of disproportionality. Consequently, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i)(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On July 30, 2002, defendant, who was then 23 years old, had sexual intercourse with the victim, who was then 15 years old, while the victim and two of his friends were visiting at defendant's home. Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County, which convicted her of rape in the fourth degree in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 770(a)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in: (1) denying her motion to suppress her confession; (2) admitting the victim's birth certificate; and (3) denying her request to defend on the basis that she reasonably believed the victim was over the age of 16. The state supreme court concluded that defendant's brief pause before she agreed to speak to a detective, followed by an unequivocal affirmative response, was not an ambiguous invocation of the right to remain silent. There was nothing in the record to suggest that her will was overcome or that her stated willingness to talk to the detective was in any way coerced. In addition, the trial court did not err in admitting the victim's birth certificate because the crime of rape in the fourth degree had only two elements: (1) intentional sexual intercourse, (2) with a person under the age of 16. Thus, defendant had to know that the State was going to provide evidence that the victim was under 16. Finally, Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 762 constituted a proper exercise of Delaware's police power because ignorance or mistake as to the age of the victim constituted no defense to a charge of statutory rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in and for New Castle County (Delaware) on a jury verdict finding him guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and sentencing him to death. He challenged various trial court rulings, mainly relating to admissibility of evidence, and also argued that a former version of the death penalty statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209, was unconstitutional as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court reviewed for abuse of discretion the trial court's evidentiary rulings and for plain error defendant's unpreserved claims of constitutional violations. Evidence of unique belt marks found on a victim's body was admissible because such a belt had been linked to defendant, whose taste in clothing was unusual. The prosecution's failure to disclose all its impeachment evidence against a defense witness was not a Brady violation because the evidence was not exculpatory in any way. A witness's recantation was not newly discovered evidence warranting a new trial because it was not admissible hearsay either as a statement against interest or under the residual exception, since it bore no indicia of reliability. The witness's story had changed more than once and the recantation was not corroborated. A prosecutor's mere repetition of defendant's statement in court did not constitute improper comment. Finally, although the death penalty statute had later been amended to explicitly require jury findings of aggravating circumstances, the former version was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant because guilty findings on two counts constituted an aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court concluded that the superior court judge did not err in denying defendant's motion to correct his sentence under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35(a) because that rule was designed to correct errors only where a sentence was imposed outside the statutory maximum, or where a sentence constituted double jeopardy, and defendant's sentence neither exceeded the statutory maximum, nor violated defendant's constitutional double jeopardy protection. Also, defendant's speedy sentencing argument was procedurally barred by the three-year time limitation under Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 61(i)(1). The State's comments asking the superior court judge to consider an alleged attempted rape at sentencing did not violate defendant's rights because the State's comments were not considered by the sentencing judge. Finally, the superior court judge properly rejected defendant's mitigating arguments in the exercise of his discretion because Del. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35(a) was limited to correcting illegal sentences, not a sentence that occurred under circumstances that defendant considered unfair or inequitable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from that part of a judgment of the Superior Court in and for New Castle County (Delaware), sentencing him to a life sentence as a habitual criminal pursuant to Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a long criminal history. While he had committed many felonies, they tended to be at the less serious, non-violent end of the spectrum. When he was finally arrested for impersonating his brother when in a situation where his criminal background could have been an embarrassment, and pled guilty, the trial court sentenced him as a habitual offender to a life term, which the trial court interpreted as a 45-year term with eligibility for conditional release based on the earning of good time credits. The high court agreed with the trial court's interpretation of the Delaware statutory scheme as leading to that sentencing result in the case of habitual offenders sentenced pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4214(a), as opposed to &sect; 4214(b), applicable to violent offenders, who were subject to natural life terms with no reductions. The high court held, however, that the trial court had abused the discretion the habitual offender statute gave it in the case of nonviolent offenders in imposing a sentence, with an effective 36-year minimum, that was grossly disproportionate to his offenses.</SPAN></P>

A folded piece of paper was removed from the pocket of defendant's sweatshirt and placed on the table. Shortly thereafter, a detective entered the room, picked up the piece of paper, opened it, and began to read it. The paper contained a handwritten confession. Defendant argued that, by unfolding the letter and reading it, the police exceeded the scope of the inventory search. In rejecting this argument, the appellate court found that reading a paper was necessary to properly catalogue and store an item. The weight of authority permitted police officers to read papers they seized during an inventory search. As to the constitutionality of his death sentence, defendant stipulated that the murder victim was pregnant, which was an aggravating factor. Defendant was not entitled to a separate finding on this aggravating factor at the penalty phase. The State also submitted evidence at the penalty phase of defendant's prior convictions for violent felonies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of three counts of murder in the first degree, robbery in the first degree, burglary in the first degree, five counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and conspiracy in the second degree. He was sentenced to death. The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County entered judgment. Defendant appealed in a direct appeal from his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his co-defendant were tried separately. There was no plain error in the trial court's not providing a Chance instruction, commanding the jury to find either that defendant was the principal in committing first degree murder by firing the fatal shot, or that he was the accomplice by firing the other non-deadly shots. The appellate court found that defendant and his co-defendant were engaged in the same enterprise, at the same time, and could not escape liability simply because the State could not prove which defendant inflicted the fatal wound. Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial by the prosecutor's improper reference to the golden rule. The trial court sustained defense counsel's objection, and the appellate court found that the case was not close. The evidence left no doubt that both defendants were acting in concert with murderous intent when the decedent was killed. The crime was ruthless and brutal. Defendant had a significant criminal history. The impact of the murder was devastating. It was a cold-blooded execution of a defenseless victim, presumably for pecuniary gain. The decision to impose the death penalty was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County convicted defendant after his guilty plea of two counts of terroristic threatening, and after a jury trial of second degree arson, third degree arson, and attempted second degree arson. Defendant appealed all convictions and, in part, claimed that the jury was not instructed, and should have been, on the lesser included offense of reckless burning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fires defendant set were inside a car that caused scorch marks on the building and in a dumpster next to a beauty shop. Defendant confessed to setting both fires. The supreme court first noted that since defendant pleaded guilty to the first set of charges, he waived his argument that his constitutional rights were violated when his counsel was not present when two witnesses identified him from a photographic lineup. The supreme court, after a review of the record for plain error, could not find that defendant's guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. The crime of reckless burning was burning that did not cause any damage. There was no evidence that the fires that defendant set did not cause damage. Therefore, the lesser included instruction was not appropriate. The supreme court noted that with respect to one burning incident the jury did reject the lesser included offense of arson-third and convicted of arson-second (both of which required damage), which also indicated that the reckless burning charge was not appropriate. The arson crimes set clear distinctions between themselves and were not constitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the admissibility of the hearsay statements from his co-conspirator, contending that the statements were not made in furtherance of the conspiracy. The State asserted that the duration of the conspiracy depended on the fact-specific scope of the original agreement and, in the instant case, included the assault that preceded the actual murders and acts to conceal the murders. The appellate court found that the record supported the State's position. One statement was to further the concealment of the crimes in progress. Another statement was to conceal involvement in the completed murders. Both were admissible. A victim's statement that he was going to meet someone from the wrestling team on the night he was killed was properly admitted, as it was a present sense impression of his state of mind and an exception to the hearsay rule, under Del. R. Evid. 803(3). While a declaration of past events was generally not admissible, a declaration of future intention was admissible. The imposition of the death penalty was constitutional, and the death sentence was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an attorney who had been suspended from the practice of law. In a further investigation of his misappropriation of client funds, a search warrant of his home was issued, and child pornography was found. Before trial, defendant moved to suppress all the evidence, arguing that the warrant lacked sufficient particularity and was overbroad, and that there was no probable cause for the search of his home. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the language of the warrant was neither vague nor overly broad. Defendant also contended that because of the State's inability to prove multiple downloads of child pornography, 29 of the 30 counts should have been barred. The appellate court found that defendant's unarticulated argument rested upon the theory that charging separately for possession and dealing, based upon the same computer image, constituted double jeopardy. Whether the two offenses were the same did not need to be addressed because there were over 190 images of alleged child pornography. The jury could have easily found that 15 of them met the elements of &quot;dealing&quot; in child pornography, and another 15 met the elements of &quot;possession.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his statement to police was involuntary. The appellate court held that the police interview was high-pressure, but defendant's will was not overborne. Defendant did not invoke his right to remain silent by asking to hear what his accomplice had told the police. The admission of transcripts on digital video discs of a victim's 911 call did not place improper emphasis on their value. Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to cross-examine witnesses in the sustaining of one question as to a police officer's opinion on methods of interrogation. The victim impact statements were not unduly prejudicial. The prosecutor did not make improper statements in closing by encouraging the jury to compare the value of the victim's life with defendant's, or in asking the jury to do justice. The death penalty statute was constitutional as applied to defendant, as the jury convicted defendant of a felony murder, a statutory aggravator. Defendant's remorse was a mitigating factor. The aggravating factors were overwhelming. The sentence was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The imposition of the death penalty was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

While noting that defendant's interview was &quot;high-pressure,&quot; the trial court found that defendant's will was not overborne. Defendant clearly understood his right to stop talking at any time he wished. The police officers telling defendant that he &quot;had&quot; to tell them what happened was in the context of if he wanted the police to consider his story, he had to tell them his story. As soon as defendant expressed concern for his safety from his co-defendant the officers agreed to keep them separated, which they did. The trial court acted within its discretion in deciding that defendant's confession was voluntary. Defendant's statement that he wanted to know what his co-defendant had said was not an ambiguous invocation of his right to remain silent. There was no abuse of discretion in the trial court's allowance of the use of transcripts, as the jury was specifically instructed that the tape recording and not the transcript was the best evidence of a 911 call on the night of the murder. Victim impact evidence, although very emotional, was not so unduly prejudicial so as to render the penalty phase of the trial fundamentally unfair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County certified four questions of law with respect to United States Supreme Court (USSC) capital sentencing precedent and the Delaware General Assembly's subsequent amendment to Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209 (2002). Defendants, who were awaiting trials for first-degree murder at which the State intended to seek the death penalty, argued that the statute was inapplicable to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general assembly amended &sect; 4209 by enacting 73 Del. Laws 423, S.B. 449, Gen. Assem. (Del. 2002), in response to a USSC decision that required the jury to make a finding regarding the existence of an aggravating factor necessary for imposition of the death penalty. On defendants' challenge, the court first held that the amendments were procedural in nature and did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. It was not required that a jury first find the existence of any specific non-statutory aggravating factor before it could be considered by the trial judge because such factors were part of the total mix considered by the trial judge while performing the weighing phase function. A jury was not required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that all aggravating factors found to exist outweighed all mitigating factors because the USSC mandate regarding jury findings did not extend to the weighing phase. Further, a trial court could constitutionally direct a verdict as to the statutory aggravating circumstances that were established by the conviction without contravening USSC precedent. Finally, sentences rendered under the 1991 version of the statute did not suffer from structural error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, concluded that the statute was valid and fully applicable to defendants, and answered the certified questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant followed the victim, a state employee, into her employment building, claiming that she had failed to assist him in his claim that the census was inaccurate. She attempted to call the police and defendant attacked her. When the police arrived, defendant continued to be aggressive and had to be maced. The appellate court held that the testimony of the police officers established that there was probable cause for the warrantless arrest. Defendant's conduct both prior to the time the police officers arrived at the scene, as described by several witnesses, and after, as observed by the police officers themselves, was clearly sufficient to support the arrest on all of the charges. Further, defendant himself bore full responsibility for any bad impression left with the jury regarding his wearing a stun belt. There was no evidence that the trial court abused its discretion either when it ordered defendant to be restrained or when it required defendant to wear the stun belt, due to defendant's disruptive conduct. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict for assault and resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of two counts of attempt to evade or defeat tax, in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 571 (1997), and three counts of failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, in violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 573 (1997). Following the entry of judgment and sentence, in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, in and for New Castle County, defendant appealed. The State moved to affirm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State moved to affirm the trial court's judgment, pursuant to Del. Sup. Ct. R. 25(a). Defendant claimed that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to try him for violating tax laws. This argument was rejected, as the appellate court found that the trial court had jurisdiction because defendant was a resident of the county in which he was tried and his state tax returns were to be filed in that county, pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 575 (1997). Defendant also argued error in granting the State's motion in limine barring defendant from testifying about the validity or constitutionality of the tax laws. The appellate court found that the trial court was clearly within its discretion in barring such testimony and in refusing to admit documents containing such arguments into evidence. There was no abuse of discretion in quashing defendant's subpoenas that were unreasonable and oppressive on their face. It was manifest on the face of defendant's brief that the instant appeal was without merit because the issues were controlled by settled Delaware law. To the extent that judicial discretion was implicated, there was clearly no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Castle County, Delaware, Superior Court convicted defendant of intentional murder, felony murder, first degree burglary, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and sentenced him to death. The jury found the Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 636(a)(2) aggravating factor of murder occurring during the commission of the burglary. Defendant appealed, and argued that the murder was not &quot;in furtherance of&quot; the burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he entered the home to kill his former girlfriend, not to commit any other crime. The supreme court reviewed the meaning of the &sect; 636(a)(2) felony murder language: &quot;in the course of&quot; and &quot;in furtherance of,&quot; and reviewed the Chao and Weick cases and a similar Arkansas statute. The supreme court concluded that, with respect to both Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 635(2), 636(a)(2), felony murder statutes that had similar language, where a burglary was alleged to be the felony on which the felony murder charge was predicated, the death that occurred was not only to be &quot;in the course of&quot; the burglary but was also to be &quot;in furtherance of&quot; the burglary. That is, the burglary was to have an independent objective that the murder facilitated. Accordingly, if the intent of the burglary was to commit murder, the death that occurred was not &quot;in furtherance of&quot; the burglary, and not a felony murder. Therefore, since defendant's death sentence was dependent upon there being a felony murder, and there was no felony murder as defined in Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 636(a)(2), defendant was to be sentenced to life in prison rather than death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed death sentence and remanded for the trial court to enter a sentence of natural life in prison without the possibility of parole on the other homicide conviction for intentional murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to trafficking and possession of a controlled substance. Sentencing was deferred pending his entrance a first offender boot camp diversion program.

Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 6712(h), clearly stated that no credit time would be given for any time spent in boot camp. Double jeopardy was not implicated since defendant voluntarily elected to participate in the boot camp program as a means to avoid serving a sentence. Because defendant did not even attempted to make an argument that there was no rational justification for the classifications created by the statute, his claim of a violation of equal protection also failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assaulted a woman in her trailer home. When the woman's mother came to her daughter's aid, defendant hit her in the head with a bottle. Defendant tied up both women. Defendant then started a fire in the trailer and left. The woman who had been assaulted fled from the trailer. Rescuers were able to save the mother from the trailer. At voir dire, one of the prospective jurors stated that he was a former teacher of defendant and upon being excused attempted to shake defendant's hand. The trial court instructed the jury that jurors were not to have contact with a defendant and to not consider what had happened. Defendant argued that the two counts for arson violated his Double Jeopardy rights and that the trial court should have ordered a mistrial because of the prospective juror's behavior. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial for the incident involving defendant's former teacher as there was no showing of any harm and the trial court gave a proper curative instruction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for Kent County after a jury convicted him of robbery, possession of a firearm during commission of a felony, and conspiracy. Defendant also appealed from the denial of his motion to declare the habitual offender statute unconstitutional or inapplicable to his case, the finding that he was an habitual offender, and his mandatory minimum sentence of 80 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were sufficient facts in the record to support the trial court's ruling that the out-of-court statement of a co-conspirator was voluntary, although it was recorded without his knowledge and against his wishes. The statement was not offered against the co-conspirator, and he admitted that the statement was made voluntarily. Also, the trial judge found that in the totality of the circumstances the statement was voluntary. A carefully tailored ruling properly allowed defendant's counsel to examine another co-conspirator about the reasons for the discrepancy between his statements, and presented to the jury his reasons along with favorable inferences that could be taken from them without improperly introducing the range of punishment that defendant could potentially face. It was not an abuse of discretion to refuse to admit a third co-conspirator's plea agreement, in light of the minimal help it could give the jury. The potential prejudice arising from the jury being aware of defendant's potential sentence substantially outweighed the probative value of that information. Defendant's contention that Delaware's habitual offender statute was unconstitutional was rejected.</SPAN></P>

The commission later sanctioned both horsemen for violating its rules prohibiting improper conduct and conducting reflecting on the integrity of harness racing. The high court held that while the rules might not have been unconstitutionally vague as to persons accused of ordinary harness racing infractions, they certainly did not give an ordinary reasonable person notice that the horsemen's efforts to avert a murder would violate the rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State had called a witness who was mentally challenged. The witness recalled giving a statement to police and voiced his intention to stick to that statement, but his testimony was equivocal and confused. The trial court then admitted the witness's prior, out of court statement. Defendant argued that the witness's memory failures, with the admission of the pre-trial statement, violated the Confrontation Clause. The appellate court held that Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 3507 permitted introduction of an out-of-court prior statement if the witness was present and subject to cross-examination. A witness's failure to remember the reasons for a past belief did not constitute a violation of the Confrontation Clause. Also, the State needed to offer only unambiguous documentary evidence of a prior predicate conviction to establish habitual offender status, not live witnesses, and not a particular type of documentary evidence. Once the State offered evidence of the prior conviction that was regular on its face, the State met its burden of establishing a prima facie case. The State's introduction of a docket sheet showing defendant's guilty plea established the predicate conviction.</SPAN></P>

In so doing the supreme court, after presuming constitutionality, inter alia, analyzed and resolved the following issues. The Act did not violate due process. The Act mandated, without discretion, all offenders to register and subjected all offenders to limited public disclosure. Another hearing was of no purpose. There was no liberty interest (1) under the open court provision of Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 for protection against disclosure of criminal prosecution information, or (2) where the disclosure tarnished reputation. There was no recognized privacy interest for juveniles even though the juvenile criminal process was essentially confidential. The Act was meaningless without disclosure. The Act did not violate equal protection. The Act related to a legitimate government purpose to protect the public. There was no arbitrary classification or recidivism presumption. Section 4121 notification was effective in 1999, but was not ex post facto, since it was not punitive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction for first degree murder, defendant appealed asserting 16 grounds for reversal. Significant among defendant's arguments was the trial court's refusal to grant a mistrial upon statement's by a witness pertaining to a polygraph test. The appellate court found that the trial court's admission of a witness's reference to a lie detector test did not require a reversal of the conviction. Further, the appellate court found that there were significant factors in the context of the totality of the state's case militating against the likelihood that these improper references constituted such substantial prejudice to defendant that the appellate court should have reversed the conviction and sentence. Additionally, Del. R. Evid. 803(3) authorized the admission of hearsay statements by the victim to her friends and psychotherapists reflecting her fear of defendant (that is, her state of mind), but not the memories or beliefs that had given rise to that fear. Finally, the appellate court found that the trial court correctly imposed the death penalty given the egregious nature and significant planning involved in defendant's actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of second degree burglary and other offenses.

Defendant was sentenced as an habitual offender to eight years for the burglary. The appellate court held the evidence supported a conviction for, and the jury was properly instructed on the elements of, second degree burglary. The defendant did not have standing to challenge constitutionality of Del. Code Ann. tit. 11 &sect; 1902. The court concluded that the appeal was wholly without merit and devoid of any arguably appealable issue. Defense counsel's motion to withdraw was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested and charged with several drug offenses. The State seized $ 783 and an automobile. By letters, the State gave appellant notice the property would be forfeited and advised appellant he had to file a civil petition for the return of property within 45 days if he wished to contest the forfeiture. The trial court granted the State's applications for forfeiture over six months after appellant's arrest. The criminal charges against appellant were ultimately nolle prossed for insufficient evidence. Seven years after his arrest, appellant filed a petition for return of his property. The petition was dismissed as untimely. A subsequent motion for reinstatement of appellant's petition was denied. On appeal, appellant alleged he was never notified of the forfeiture and that he was the sole owner of the seized property. Judgment was affirmed. Appellant's petition was properly dismissed as untimely, as it was filed more than six years after notification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a co-defendant were indicted on charges of murder first degree and burglary arising out of the shooting deaths of defendant's estranged wife and her companion. Following the co-defendant's conviction, defendant decided to enter pleas of guilty. After an extensive plea colloquy, the trial court accepted defendant's pleas to one count of intentional murder and one count of felony murder. The case was an appeal from the trial court's denial of a second motion for post-conviction relief. The court agreed with the trial court that the defendant's guilty plea provided a sufficient factual and legal basis for the establishment of the necessary statutory aggravating factors for the jury's weighing determination in the punishment phase under Delaware's capital punishment procedure mandated by Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 4209. Defendant pleaded guilty to offenses which, ipso facto, provided a basis for a finding that two statutory aggravating factors resulted from his criminal conduct. By his guilty plea, defendant subjected himself to the maximum penalty without further factual findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant found the body of his tenant, who had been shot, and called police. He consented to residue testing but refused permission to search his nearby automobiles. Police obtained a search warrant for the vehicles, based on &quot;wishing to secure potential physical evidence,&quot; and found two guns. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress this evidence. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, possession of a firearm during commission of a felony, and possession of a firearm by a person prohibited. The lower court granted his subsequent motion for a new trial on the first two convictions, on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct and inadmissible evidence. The third conviction went up on direct appeal. The court concluded the warrant to search defendant's automobiles was issued without a demonstration of probable cause, requiring exclusion of the firearms evidence so obtained, and reversed the third conviction. Police suspicion and proximity of the vehicles did not provide probable cause. There must have been some nexus between specific items sought and the place to be searched.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of 19 counts of robbery and weapons offenses. The trial court imposed a mandatory habitual offender sentence of eight life terms plus 78 years mandatory. Defendant appealed his conviction and his sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to appoint standby counsel to assist defendant in his defense. Although defendant only had a tenth grade education, he had been a defendant in three previous jury trials and informed the trial court that he wished to conduct his own defense. Applying a three-part analysis, the court held that there was no reversible error with respect to the alleged improper prosecutorial conduct. The trial court's finding that defendant was a habitual offender was legally correct, and defendant offered no proof of prosecutorial bias that constituted reversible error. Finally, the trial court did not err by declining to merge the robbery and weapons charges related to each of the two robberies, and the defendant properly was sentenced for both first degree robbery and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that there was no basis to conclude that juveniles should have been exempted from the operation of the statute simply because the criminal process for juveniles was confidential. The court stated that the statutory mandate of registration would have become meaningless without the disclosure of defendant's identity.

Appellants then filed petitions for writ of certiorari in the lower court, but the petition was denied. The lower court reasoned that it lacked jurisdiction because no statute authorized appeals from the board's decision. The judgment was reversed and remanded, because the lower court was incorrect in holding that it did not have jurisdiction.

The lower court granted summary judgment to the county, finding that the ordinance was rationally related to a legitimate government interest. On appeal, the judgment of the lower court was affirmed. Annual sewer assessment charges were rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose of creating a more equitable distribution between present and future users based on a front footage basis.

IV, as plaintiffs did not have a legitimate privacy interest that sufficed to shield them from GPS monitoring, the incremental infringement on plaintiffs' privacy imposed by the GPS monitoring requirement was not unduly burdensome, and &sect; 4121(u) was relatively efficacious in advancing Delaware's legitimate interest in reducing sex offender recidivism; [2]-Because Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 did not provide broader search protections than the Fourth Amendment, the statute did not violate the Delaware Constitution either; [3]-The court was bound by a Delaware Supreme Court holding that the retroactive application of &sect; 4121(u) did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The boards each adopted a bylaw which provided that litigation relating to internal affairs was to be conducted in Delaware. Such bylaws were based on the powers conferred upon the boards in their certificates of incorporation pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, &sect; 109(a), and the boards' desire to avoid &quot;multiforum litigation&quot; over single events. The SHs filed suit, challenging the &quot;forum selection bylaws&quot; on multiple counts. The court initially noted that consolidation of the two actions was appropriate under Del. Ch. Ct. R. 42(a). With respect to the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to certain claims, the court held that the bylaws were facially valid under &sect; 109(b), as they easily met the statutory requirements therein. The bylaw provisions plainly related to the business of the corporations, the conduct of their affairs, and the rights or powers of the SHs. Further, Delaware law enforced forum selection clauses. The court also held that the bylaws were valid and enforceable contractual forum selection clauses. It noted that such clauses were respected and enforced in Delaware. The SHs' hypothetical situations did not present a real controversy to be addressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employer sought a declaration that the Delaware Prevailing Wage Law, Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect;&sect; 6960-6970, did not require it to pay its employees the prevailing wage rates (PWRs) set by defendants, the Delaware Department of Labor (DOL) and its Secretary. It also sought injunctive relief and relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Defendants sought dismissal due to the employer's alleged failure to exhaust its administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOL previously informed the employer that it was not required to pay its employees PWRs. However, it subsequently reversed its position and demanded that the employer pay the difference between what was paid and what the PWRs required. The employer brought suit. In resolving the dismissal motion, the court concluded that the case was not properly before it. Rather, the employer first had to exhaust its administrative remedies. The dispute between the parties clearly pertained to the classification of workers under 19 Del. Code Regs. &sect; 1322-7.1.2.4. The employer's conclusory assertion that pursuing administrative remedies would be futile, without supporting facts, was unpersuasive. Further, it presented no facts to support its assertion that exigent circumstances excused the exhaustion of administrative remedies. Lastly, the court found that the administrative remedy before the Secretary provided an adequate remedy at law. Similarly, a claim of equitable estoppel also required an initial administrative determination, and consideration of the &sect; 1983 claim was deferred pending a final definitive position. Lack of compliance under &sect; 6960(l) did not require a different result.</SPAN></P>

R. 59(f) of the dismissal of their land use claims, wherein they challenged the actions of defendants, a town, the town council, and various town officials, with respect to the approval of a redevelopment plan. The trial court had determined that their claims were extinguished by the Statute of Repose under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8126.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an effort to settle litigation brought against the town by a developer, the town agreed to allow it to redevelop an area in accordance with a redevelopment plan. In exchange, the developer, inter alia, released the town from claims underlying the litigation. Pursuant to a process set out in the parties' agreement, the town council considered, and approved, the plan. The POs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the redevelopment plan from moving forward. The court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action because the claims were extinguished under &sect; 8126, and it dismissed the action. The POs sought reargument under Rule 59(f). The court held that whether or not a constitutional claim was presented, as the argument was not raised prior to the motion for reargument, it was barred. Similarly, the POs' claim that the resolution notice by the town did not satisfy the notice requirement of &sect; 8126(a) was also barred where it was first raised in the reargument motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former shareholder (FS) filed a motion for an award of attorneys' fees and expenses after her derivative action against defendants, a corporation and the former board of directors, was dismissed by stipulation. The FS had alleged that the cash bonuses paid to various corporate officers were not tax-deductible because they did not meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 162(m).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The FS alleged that the cash bonuses paid to various corporate officers failed to meet the requirements of &sect; 162(m), which resulted in a failure of the corporation to obtain millions of dollars in tax deductions over several years. Accordingly, she asserted claims of waste, breach of fiduciary duties by the board, and material misstatements or omissions in the proxy statements. Shortly after the complaint was served, the board adopted a tax-deductible cash bonus plan, which mooted most of the claims. The parties thereafter agreed to a stipulated order of dismissal, which was granted by the court. The FS sought recovery of her attorneys' fees and expenses under the corporate benefit doctrine. The court found that although the board made an arguably poor business judgment in its initial bonus compensation plan, that did not excuse demand on the board by the FS. Arguments challenging the directors' independence and disinterestedness lacked merit, as did allegations that they had acted in bad faith. Further, the FS's waste claim failed, and her lack of disclosure claim would not have survived a dismissal motion. Accordingly, the FS failed to show that demand was excused.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county levy court adopted a land use comprehensive plan. The landowners contended that the ordinance adopting the comprehensive plan worked a zoning change on their properties because, pursuant to the land use map incorporated in the comprehensive plan, the density of the permissible development of their properties was significantly reduced. They alleged numerous violations of constitutional and statutory law arising from the alleged down-zoning of their properties. The county responded that the comprehensive plan and its associated land use map were planning documents only and had not changed the landowners' property rights. The court found that, pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 9, &sect;&sect; 4951(b) and 4959, the land use maps had the force of law, and the county could not permit development of the properties except in conformity with the new land use map. Assuming that the factual allegations of the petition were true, the landowners therefore suffered a diminution in their ability to develop the properties, and their allegations that the rezoning failed to conform to statutory and constitutional requirements were ripe for consideration in the action.</SPAN></P>

Direct and derivative claims were asserted for negligence, waste, and violation of fiduciary duties. Defendants sought dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mutual funds purchased shares of allegedly illegal foreign online gambling businesses in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1955. The shareholders alleged that defendants were aware of the illegality of the investments and the increasing enforcement against such investments, and that they breached their fiduciary duties by continuing to own the stocks, resulting in large losses. In resolving defendants' dismissal motion, the court found that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the individual defendants. Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, &sect; 18-109(a) did not provide a basis for jurisdiction, as the claims did not relate to the internal business of a limited liability company. Similarly, the conspiracy theory failed where a conspiracy was not sufficiently alleged. Further, Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3104(c)(2), (3), and (4), as well as the minimum contacts test of the due process clause, did not support jurisdiction. The shareholders failed to allege an independent injury for purposes of their alleged direct claims. The court also found that demand for purposes of the derivative claims was not excused under Del.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After attempts to acquire the corporation were rebuffed, the TO made a structurally non-coercive, all-cash, fully financed tender offer directed to the CSs.

The court held that the board had the power to defeat the inadequate hostile tender offer. Further, it met its burden under Unocal to articulate a legally cognizable threat based on the allegedly inadequate price of the TO's offer as well as the fact that a majority of the CSs would likely tender into that inadequate offer. The court noted that the board was independent and that it relied on the advice of three outside independent financial advisors in reaching its conclusion that the offer price was inadequate. The offer was not structurally coercive and there was no threat of opportunity loss. The board took defensive measures that were within the range of reasonable responses proportionate to the threat and which were not preclusive. There was no breach of fiduciary duties by the board because it acted in good faith and with an honest belief as to the offer's inadequacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rental property owners challenged a city ordinance that required landlords to obtain and pay for a rental permit on the ground that it was a tax because the city was raising more from the rental permit fees than was required for it to recoup the costs of regulating the city's rental property businesses, and the city's charter did not authorize such a tax. The court found that the city's charter had been interpreted consistently for over a half-century as one that although broadly empowering, placed limitations on the city's ability to act in the area of taxation. Further, the city, recognizing that its taxing authority was limited, took advantage of 22 Del. Code Ann. &sect; 830(b), which allowed a municipal corporation, the charter of which imposed a limitation on its taxing authority, to increase its property taxes in a manner prescribed in that provision, and substantially increased its taxing authority in strict conformity with the contours of that provision. However, &sect; 830(b) barred a unilateral expansion of the city's taxing authority outside the narrow confines in &sect; 830. Moreover, &sect; 830 did not allow city to avail itself of the statute to enact new taxes by a simple ordinance.</SPAN></P>

When the owners did not connect within that period, the town filed the petition for a mandatory injunction. The owners claimed that compulsory participation in the town water system was unconstitutional because it was beyond the power of the municipality, constituted a taking, and unlawfully forced them to enter into an unwanted contract. The court found, inter alia, that the town charter vested broad authority in the town council to adopt ordinances for securing protection and promotion of health, safety, comfort, convenience, welfare, and happiness of its owners. Parallel challenges had been considered and rejected in a nearly indistinguishable factual contexts. Accordingly, because the town ordinances were valid and binding, the owners were ordered to connect to the town water system and pay penalties, interest, fees, and the town's costs, as a prevailing party.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 202 in order to allow the PS to enroll in a high school where the OB and the PS resided. Defendants sought dismissal under Del. Ch. Ct. R. 12(b)(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PS previously lived with his mother, but he moved in with his OB prior to the start of the school year. The OB attempted to enroll the PS at the high school but was informed that certain documentation had to be completed first. Thereafter, plaintiffs were informed that the district would not accept the OB's Caregivers School Authorization pursuant to &sect; 202. Plaintiffs filed suit, seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages. The district indicated that the PS could enroll in the school, thereby mooting the injunctive relief request. As to the dismissal motion, the court found that plaintiffs failed to adequately allege an equal protection violation under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as they failed to plead facts showing that the PS was discriminated against because of his race. Plaintiffs' claim that the district provided no rational reason for delaying the PS's admission lacked merit, as such was not a required showing by the district where no fundamental right or suspect classification was involved. Claims for intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress were not supported by sufficient factual allegations.</SPAN></P>

The DCSE asserted, inter alia, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee filed his claim and in support thereof, he alleged that the State owed him a duty of care and breached that duty by suspending his license. He further challenged the constitutionality of the statutes that authorized DCSE's actions. In response, DCSE asserted, inter alia, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. The court decided to address the subject matter jurisdiction issue at the outset of the litigation. It found that review of DCSE's decision was to be to a Delaware family court pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect;&sect; 10102(4) and 10142(a). Further, the family court had exclusive jurisdiction over decisions of the DCSE under Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 921(13), and it had jurisdiction over matters involving licenses due to failure to pay child support pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 516(h). &quot;As applied&quot; constitutional challenges were to be made to the family court under the exhaustion of remedies doctrine. As the family court had jurisdiction over the facial constitutional challenges and it could provide an adequate remedy under &sect; 921(3), the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Del.

</DIV>

The court noted that only the LLC-A/M failed to appear in the action. He resided and conducted his daily work in Singapore, and he asserted that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. The court noted that the third-party claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the LLC-A/M were based on his capacity as a manager of the principal LLC, which the parties held interests in. The allegations supporting the claims were supported by sufficient facts, including that the LLC-A/M solicited and usurped opportunities for the principal LLC, failed to give his utmost loyalty, disclosed confidential information for his own benefit, and misappropriated the principal's resources. The court found that there was an independent basis for the fiduciary duty claims, including breach of the duty of loyalty, that survived. The court had jurisdiction over them pursuant to &sect; 18-109. Further, it had jurisdiction over the contractual claims, as they involved or related to the principal's holdings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Delaware, determined that filings by appellant, the Delaware Compensation Rating Bureau, Inc. ( DCRB), did not reflect all savings realized by 76 Del. Laws 1. The Commissioner directed the DCRB to resubmit a filing. The DCRB appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DCRB and the Commissioner were in a dispute over the meaning and effect of certain amendments to ch. 26 of the Delaware Insurance Code, which specifically covered workers' compensation insurance. In particular, the parties fundamentally disagreed about the proper construction of Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 2609(d), which was added as part of a reform of the workers' compensation insurance system. The primary issue presented was whether the Commissioner erred in determining that 76 Del. Laws 1 provided that cost savings associated with claims arising from pre-October occurrences were to be taken into account when setting prospective rates. The court found that the DCRB was, when filing its rating plan, to include, in an actuarially appropriate manner, all savings resulting from 76 Del. Laws 1. Moreover, the DCRB's contention that 76 Del. Laws 1, as construed by the Commissioner, violated the Contract Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 was without merit because the Commissioner's orders providing for the additional prospective rate reductions to account for cost savings arising out of claims from pre-October occurrences had no effect on preexisting contracts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders of the Commissioner were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county government adopted four new subdivision ordinances requiring developers to provide financial assistance for the county's roads, schools, emergency medical services, and water. The landowners and developers challenged them. The trial court found that the ordinance regarding schools was too vague to be enforceable because the ordinance allowed &quot;mitigation payments&quot; without including a formula to determine such payments. Otherwise, the trial court held that (1) Del. Code Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 4959(c) did not exempt the landowners and developers from complying with the ordinances; (2) Del. Code Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 4911 was not violated since the proposed ordinances were made the subject of a public hearing; (3) each ordinance when introduced was in the &quot;form required for final adoption,&quot; as mandated by Del. Code Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 4110(i)(1); (4) the county government was not required to mail notice pursuant to Del. Code Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 4926 to every county property owner because no &quot;zoning change&quot; was involved; (5) the roads ordinance did not impermissibly delegate power, and (6) the ordinances as drafted, other than the school ordinance, were not impermissibly vague and ambiguous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment for the landowners and developers regarding their claim that the new subdivision ordinance requiring provision of financial assistance to schools was invalidly adopted and unenforceable.

The court held that the association, even with the approval of a majority of the lot owners, did not have the power to restrict the property owners in the free use of their individual lots. The court held that the association's power to adopt rules and regulations under the chancery final judgment was limited to matters involving the governance of the association as an organization itself and the maintenance of the common areas and amenities of the community. The court considered the notice of class action hearing and the court's narrow focus when it issued the chancery judgment, including the editing of a settlement agreement to exclude restrictive covenants not related to the assessments for the purchase and maintenance of the common areas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, landowners and developers, filed suit under the Delaware Freedom of Information Act, Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, &sect; 10001 et seq., against respondents, the county, the county commissioners, and the planning commission, to challenge the county's adoption and implementation of ordinances. The county, the commissioners, and the commission moved for a protective order under Del. Ch. Ct. R. 26(c) to resist requested discovery in the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county, the commissioners, and the commission refused to produce commissioners and members of the commission, for depositions requested by the owners and the developers because the county officials were entitled to absolute legislative immunity from suit and, thus, they also were absolutely privileged from being deposed by the owners and the developers. The court found that the county, the commissioners, and the commission could not absolutely preclude the owners and the developers from seeking discovery from the officials on the basis of legislative immunity. They could, however, assert legislative privilege to limit the scope of permissible discovery. Given those limitations, the court, pursuant to Del. Ch. Ct. R. 26(b)(1), decided to seek additional input from counsel regarding whether a protective order was to limit the owners' and the developers' means of seeking discovery from the county officials, at least initially, to those that might be considered less intrusive and burdensome, such as written interrogatories, depositions upon written interrogatories, or a limitation on the number of county officials to be deposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the county, the commissioners, and the commission were entitled to a protective order, but the court deferred a determination of the extent of the order pending additional input from counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a collection of organizations and interested citizens, sued defendant, Kent County, Delaware, to invalidate a Bulk Utilities Ordinance enacted by the county. The organizations and the citizens filed a motion for summary judgment. The county filed a cross-motion for summary judgment to have the Bulk Utilities Ordinance upheld as validly enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary concern of the organizations and the citizens regarding the Bulk Utilities Ordinance was that it, if validly adopted, would have limited the density of development on parcels of land outside Kent County, Delaware's designated Growth Zone by requiring conditional use approval for community wastewater systems and that community wastewater systems serve entire community sewer basins. That problem, they contended resulted in a violation of Del. Code Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 4110, which addressed the procedures the county was to use to adopt legislation. They also argued that the ordinance, as ultimately enacted, amended the county's zoning code. The court found that the title of the ordinance satisfied the requirement in &sect; 4110 that the title of a bill fairly identify the subject matter it addressed. However, the county by enacting the ordinance changed its zoning code without following the procedures required by Del. Code Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 4911. Thus, the portion of the ordinance amending the zoning code was invalid. Because of the ordinance's severability provision, the entire ordinance did not have to be invalidated, but only the portion of the ordinance that amended the zoning code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted summary judgment to the organizations and the individuals as to the conditional use approval requirement and the public utility classification portions of the ordinance and declared that those portions were invalid. The court granted summary judgment to the county as to the remaining portions of the ordinance and upheld the validity of those portions of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers claimed that they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the court under the nonresident officer consent to service of process statute,&nbsp;Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 3114(b). The shareholders contended that the receipt, continued holding, vesting of, and (in some cases) exercise of allegedly backdated options triggered the applicability of &sect; 3114(b) as these actions constituted a breach of fiduciary duties. They also alleged that personal jurisdiction existed as to one officer who knew of the backdating because of his involvement in the practice. The court, rejecting the shareholders' invocation of the continuing wrong doctrine, found that the allegations did not permit the use of &sect; 3114(b) as a basis to exercise jurisdiction over the officers who merely received stock options. However, the court found that it had personal jurisdiction under &sect; 3114(b) over the officer who allegedly was involved in the backdating practice as it was inferable that he engaged in deceptive conduct to conceal the practice in violation of the duty of loyalty he owed to shareholders. Finally, the court found that the assertion of jurisdiction over the officer satisfied due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Code Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 223, assigned every student in the district to the grade-appropriate school closest to the student's residence, without regard to any consideration other than geographic distance and the natural boundaries of neighborhoods. Because of its non-contiguous design, the school district was left to craft a Neighborhood School Plan for a district for which that concept made little or no geographic sense. After the Delaware State Board of Education denied two proposed Neighborhood School Plans by the school district, the district approved a Strategic Plan to close four elementary schools in the city, offer no middle or high school programming in the city, and use two middle schools in the city as elementary schools. The parents and the city contended that the school district was to submit a Neighborhood School Plan that complied with the NSA's mandates. The court ruled for the parents and the city as the court could not ignore the district's failure to comply with the NSA or the adverse consequences that the parents and the city faced if an injunction was not issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the early morning hours, following almost six hours of public hearing, the county levy court approved a Coastal Zone Protection Overlay Ordinance. The owners argued that because the ordinance resulted in differing treatment of similarly-zoned properties inside and outside of the Coastal Zone Protection Overlay District, the county violated the uniformity requirements of Del. Code Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 4902(b). The issue before the court was did &sect; 4902(a), which entitled the county to divide the territory of the county into districts or zones, preclude the county from layering such divisions one atop another? Or, did the uniformity requirement of &sect; 4902(b) apply only to regulations enacted under that section, such that the county possessed independent statutory authority to enact regulations under Del. Code Ann. tit. 9, &sect; 4903 entirely unburdened by any uniformity requirement. The court found that the county had divided itself into districts for purposes of Del. Code Ann. ch. 49 of tit. 9.

The decedent had drafted a holographic Last Will and Testament and the codicil while living in the State of New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The codicil was not signed nor dated. The will made only one complete testamentary gift: leaving the entire estate to the decedent's sister, if the sister survived the decedent. The will did not address the possibility of the sister dying before the decedent. The codicil filled that gap by stating that, in the event the sister predeceased the decedent, the decedent's siblings and about half of her nieces and nephews were the contingent beneficiaries. The decedent's siblings had all died before she did. Therefore, if the codicil was given force, the estate passed to the five nieces and nephews named therein. If, however, the codicil was declared invalid, the estate passed by intestacy, which entitled petitioners to a share of the estate. Respondent argued that the codicil was valid because there was no dispute that the decedent wrote it or that, by its plain terms, it worked with the will in a sensible manner. However, the court found no merit in respondent's challenges to the plain language of Del. Code Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 1306 and Del. Code Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 202, which only gave deference to wills executed in other states when those wills were signed by the testator.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declined to dismiss the developer's vested rights claim. It could not conclude that the developer's private interests were outweighed by the public interests behind the bill amending the statute. An equitable estoppel claim failed because the State had done nothing upon which the developer relied and because the county had to act in accordance with state law. The court rejected the developer's substantive due process claim. Even if the county was guided by political motivations, this was not enough to shock the conscience. As for the State, it was acting within its police powers when it enacted the bill. Legislative acts could not form the basis for a procedural due process claim. An equal protection claim failed because the developer had not shown that the bill lacked any rational basis. Finally, the unlawful taking claim under Del. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 failed. The court could not conclude that the bill fell just short of eliminating all economically beneficial use of the developer's parcel; mere compliance with the law did not automatically establish a taking; and the character of the regulation did not support a finding that the bill resulted in a temporary taking.</SPAN></P>

The legislature passed a bond bill telling the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) to proceed with dredging, mooting the organization's administrative appellate success, but it did not violate separation of powers because it (1) did not reverse the remand order, and (2) required adherence to prior permits. The legislature had plenary authority to tell the DNREC how to proceed. The legislation did not violate the single subject rule in Del. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 as it was in a fiscal bill to which art. II, &sect; 16 did not apply. Any interference with the organization's procedural due process rights was not irreparable injury. It lost no substantive right or privilege. Any harm was procedural, as the cost/benefit analysis could not alone prevent dredging. Theoretical injury from DNREC's refusal to amend its cost/benefit analysis (given the legislative enactment) was not irreparable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff private citizens moved, and defendants, public officials, two state agencies, a developer, a property owner, and a potential property owner, cross-moved for summary judgment in the citizens' challenge to the rezoning of a tract of land from light industrial to commercial. The citizens argued that statutorily required procedures had not been followed and that the action was inconsistent with the town's comprehensive plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The comprehensive plan at the time of the rezoning called for development of a computer chip plant or similar industry on the site, but when that prospect did not work out, without amending the plan, the officials decided to rezone the property to commercial with the expectation that a major discount retailer would build a supercenter on the site. The state agencies did not raise obstacles, but the citizens challenged the rezoning. The court held that neither Del. Code Ann. tit. 29, chs. 91 and 92, which related to Delaware's Office of State Planning Coordination, nor Del. Code Ann. tit. 17, &sect;&sect; 131 and 508, which related to the Delaware Department of Transportation, created implied private rights of action for failure to follow their procedures. Del. Code Ann. tit. 22, &sect; 702(d), which mandated that rezonings be shown to be consistent with governing comprehensive plans, did provide such a right, however, and it seemed likely that the citizens would be able to establish standing to challenge the rezoning on that basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conditioned on their subsequent cure of a deficiency in the affidavits establishing their standing, the court awarded summary judgment to the private citizens declaring that the rezoning was invalid for failure to establish consistency with the plan, but dismissed all their other claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The spectators asked the court to declare that Del. Fam. Ct. Admin. Directive 98.02 and a variety of legislative statutes, which they failed to specify, were unconstitutional. They also asked the court to order that the Family Court must open all its proceedings and records to public access, absent a judicial determination that closure was necessary to protect a compelling government interest. But, when the spectators sought access before the Kent County Family Court Judge, they could have made precisely the arguments they presently sought to press and argued that due to Family Court's newborn constitutional court status, the could not validly apply either Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 1063(a), the statute that presumptively closed dependency/neglect proceedings, or the Directive, in deciding whether to allow them access. They could have contended that the Family Court Judge was duty bound to allow them access unless a party to the case could show that denying them access would impair a compelling governmental interest. Assuming that these arguments would have been rejected, an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court served as an adequate remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff environmental organization sought a preliminary injunction preventing dredging of a canal, arguing that this negated its successful appeal of a permit issuance, by defendant Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), when the Environmental Appeals Board had ordered a remand. It claimed that the dredging subverted the Subaqueous Lands Act, Del. Code Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 7205.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization sought review of DNREC's decision to issue a dredging permit for the canal, and the Board had, in fact, remanded the decision to DNREC. The remand had not been based on environmental concerns, however, but had simply requested further articulation of DNREC's cost-benefit analysis. In the meantime, the legislature had enacted special legislation dealing only with the dredging of the canal in question. The legislation included specific findings that the benefits outweighed the costs, no matter how high. This was something the legislature was entirely free to do, even though it somewhat short-circuited the administrative process. In any event, since the organization showed little likelihood of prevailing on the merits, particularly since its standing was questionable, or that irreparable harm was likely to result, or that its potential hardship would outweigh that faced by DNREC, a grant of preliminary injunctive relief was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a county and its administration, filed a motion for summary judgment with regard to the complaint brought by plaintiff, two citizens, which asserted that the county was illegally retaining $ 200 in surplus revenue garnered from various funds. The citizens sought to permanently enjoin an impending $ 80 million bond sale proposed by the county. The citizens sought a declaratory judgment and primarily asserted unjust enrichment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surplus revenues accumulated over a period of eight years. The citizens contended that the retention of the surplus revenues was in excess of the 20 percent limitation placed on county reserves and that the county was not allowed to issue the bonds at the same time it was enjoying a $ 200 million surplus. In prior proceedings, the court admonished the county for its procedures used to establish the reserves as contrary to the county's charter. The court had determined that the administration had exceeded its authority and that a majority of the county's reserves were being held off budget, in clear violation of law. In turn, the county voluntarily stayed its bond issuance and adopted two ordinances that created two new reserve accounts, one for tax and one for sewer rate stabilization. The court held that summary judgment in favor of the county was appropriate since the reserve limitations established by Del. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6(b)-(d) only applied to the State of Delaware, not its counties. The two adopted ordinances were upheld as lawful as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered summary judgment in favor of the county on all counts of the citizens' second amended and supplemental complaint and dismissed the citizens' claims with prejudice in their entirety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This litigation arose out of a historic 1998 tobacco settlement between the nation's largest tobacco companies and 46 of the states' attorneys general. The tobacco companies agreed to fund the foundation, which was charged with creating programs to reduce youth tobacco product usage. As part of its mission, the foundation created a series of television and radio ads under the brand &quot;the truth.&quot; The fundamental argument between the parties was the meaning of the word &quot;vilification&quot; and the phrase &quot;personal attack&quot; in the settlement agreement. The court considered case law, dictionary definitions, and law reviews to determine these meanings. The court found that many of the foundation's ads did not have a serious tone and that none of the ads violated the anti-vilification clause of the settlement agreement. The ads' messages were based on well-known public facts. In addition, none of the ads violated the personal attack clause of the agreement. Each of them portrayed tobacco companies and tobacco company employees in a negative light, but none of the ads specifically identified a target of an alleged attack.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foundation's motion for summary judgment was granted, and the tobacco company's motion for summary judgment was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was incorporated in Delaware, privately owned, headquartered in California, and it had regional offices in five states, none of which was Delaware. The PS was a Delaware limited partnership that owned 83 percent of the corporation's PS. A stockholder vote was to be had on a pending merger, and the PS claimed that a separate class vote should be held for the PSs. The corporation sought a declaration as to which law was controlling. It was noted that if the vote was governed by Delaware law, then common and preferred stockholders would all vote on the merger as a single class. However, if California law controlled, as argued by the PS, then the PSs would have the right to vote as a separate class. In the latter situation, the PS would effectively have a veto over the merger. The court initially noted that there was an actual, ripe controversy for purposes of a declaratory judgment. The court held that the vote was governed by the internal affairs doctrine for purposes of choice of law. Accordingly, Calif. Corp. Code &sect; 2115 was deemed inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a scheduled planning commission meeting, the Planning Commission &quot;reaffirmed&quot; its support for a rezoning of certain lots, including the property owners' lots.

The property owners, represented by counsel, appeared at the hearing and presented evidence and argument, including expert testimony. The majority of those speaking, however, were members of the public in favor of the rezoning. The court found there was substantial evidence to support the rationale of the motion as adopted by the Commission. Numerous witnesses testified that the area covered by the rezoning change was residential in nature and that commercial development would be harmful. The property owners had notice to appear at the public hearing and that they could and did present arguments, at length, against adoption of the ordinance. The Commissioners did not act arbitrarily in determining that rezoning was in the interest of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff optometrist sued defendant Delaware Board of Examiners in Optometry for a declaration that the conditions of her employment and, in particular, her relationship with a commercial optician, did not violate Del. Code Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2113, as the Board found. She also sought an injunction to enjoin the Board from taking any action to suspend or revoke her license to practice optometry. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The optometrist, in her practice, shared a building with a commercial optician, from which her employer subleased office space at a monthly rate far below market value. Her practice shared a common entrance with the optician, and shared open spaces and facilities. The widely publicized address of the optometrist's practice was identical to the optician's, and the practice's phone number was prominently associated with other of the optician's locations. Further, the optician's practice engaged in mutual advertising and marketing strategies with the optician. The entities shared conspicuous signage and advertising, both at the practice location and in the Internet, through the optician's own website and other informational sites such as medical and vision plan insurance, as well as promotional discounts offered at the optometrist's office location offered at the conclusion of an examination. The court found that substantial evidence existed to support the Board's findings as to the violations of Del. Code Ann. tit. 24, &sect;&sect; 2113(a)(5) and 2113(a)(6). However, the Board erred as a matter of law when it concluded that the optometrist violated Del. Code Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2113(a)(2)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed in part as to finding that the optometrist advertised with and practiced in conjunction with the optician; however the decision was reversed in part as to the finding that the optometrist's office did not conform to that used by the majority of professional optometrists in the area.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners challenged the validity of the commissioner's actions in adopting an ordinance which purported to rezone the owners' properties. The city and its commissioners argued that Del. Code Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 8126(a), the statute of repose, imposed a period during which suit could be filed commencing on the date of publication of the ordinance and ending 60 days thereafter. Because the owners filed suit after the rezoning was adopted, but before publication, the city and its commissioners argued that the suit was not filed within the period called for by statute and was therefore untimely. Additionally, the city and its commissioners argued that the owners failed to join a party in the action who was the holder of a contingent remainder interest. The court found that the complaint was not void as premature. In addition, there was no indispensable party then not joined pursuant Del. Ch. Ct. R. 19(a). The case did not have to be dismissed based upon the failure to join the holder of a remainder interest in the affected property whose interested never vested and which was never transferred to the party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developer sued defendants, a county, its planning board, and the county department of land use, for a permanent injunction preventing application of the Sunsetting Law, New Castle County, Del., Code &sect; 40.01.130, to the developer's proposed plan. Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings as to certain paragraphs challenging the validity of the law because they were beyond the time allowed by the land use statute of repose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1997, the county revised its land use regulations and adopted what was known as the Unified Development Code (UDC), a compilation of all county development regulations, including regulations on zoning, subdivisions, design, concurrency, impact fees, and signs. As part of the UDC, the county adopted the Sunsetting Law, which provided that if the owner of a major land development project, which had been approved and recorded by December 31, 1997, did not commence construction before December 31, 2002, the approval would expire and any subsequent development effort would be governed by the land use regulations then in effect. When the developer did not begin construction before December 31, 2002, defendants voided the developer's plan. The developer then sought to enjoin application of the Sunsetting Law. The court granted defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the challenge to the Sunsetting Law, finding that the developer had a 60-day period in which to challenge the ordinance after notice of its enactment was properly published, and that because the challenge was commenced more than five years after the publication, the challenge was time barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by plaintiffs, landlords to students within defendant city and the landlords' representative association, the court had previously concluded that City of Newark, Del., Ord. &sect;&sect; 99-10, 99-14 violated the Delaware Fair Housing Act (DFHA), Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, ch. 46, and the Delaware Residential Landlord-Tenant Code, Del. Code Ann. tit. 25, ch. 51-50. Before the court was the reserved issue of severability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its prior decision, the court had found that the definition of a living arrangement in City of Newark, Del. Ord. &sect; 99-14 as a single-family detached dwelling comprised of post-secondary students, unrelated by marriage, operated to discriminate on the basis of marital status as prohibited by the DFHA. The city contended that the ordinance should be severed because, by striking the offending language, the discriminatory effect would be eliminated, while leaving intact the intent of the city council. Plaintiffs argued that it was not severable because removing the offending language would broaden the scope of the ordinance beyond the legislative intent. Determining that the discriminatory language could not be severed, the court held that: (1) it would violate the will of the city council, as evidenced by its clearly expressed decision to exempt married students from the restrictions, if the exclusion for married students was severed from the ordinance. This provision of the law was intended to rise and fall with the rest of the law. In addition, the severability provisions in the city ordinances did not result in severance because it would contravene the legislative intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the city's request to sever the discriminatory ordinance, and it ordered that both ordinances were invalidated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers moved for summary judgment in an action against defendants, a county and its county executive and county administrator, seeking to enjoin the county from paying attorneys' fees and from conducting defense work in county office space and interviewing county employees during work hours. Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. A temporary restraining order had been issued by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The investigation concerned the use of county employees for political campaign purposes. The court held that the amendment to New Castle County, Del., Code &sect; 2.03.201, providing indemnification in some circumstances for legal fees of county officials, was properly retroactive. The statute was constitutional under Del. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 8. Indemnification furthered, inter alia, the public purpose of encouraging the recruitment and retention of high-risk officers. Defendants were permanently enjoined from interviewing county employees during working hours and using county office space. It was premature to enjoin the payment of the legal fees, as the county attorney had not made a determination as to whether the fees would be paid. Relief was not available at law under a writ of certiorari, mandamus, or prohibition, providing jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of Delaware. Further, the chancery court had jurisdiction through the injunctive relief already granted. Maintaining jurisdiction over the entirety of the action met the factors for chancery court jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment were granted. The taxpayers' motion for summary judgment was granted as to the request to enjoin the use of county office space and the interviewing of county employees during working hours. The request to enjoin the payment of legal fees for legal representation of the county executive and the county administrator was stayed.</SPAN></P>
