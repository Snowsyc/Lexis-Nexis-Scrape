</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County, California, which denied its petition for a writ of administrative mandate seeking to overturn respondent California Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board's decision that upheld a citation from respondent California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health, for a violation of Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, &sect; 1592, subd. (e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A worker on foot had suffered serious injury after being hit by one of the employer's scrapers, a 98,000 pound piece of earth moving equipment. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, &sect; 1592, subd. (e), required hauling or earth moving operations to be controlled so that operators knew of the presence of workers on foot in the areas of operation. In the employer's view, the safety regulation was unconstitutionally vague, and the Board failed to determine whether the employer's conduct was reasonable. The court held that the regulation's &quot;control&quot; requirement was not impermissibly vague. A reasonable and practical construction of the regulation put businesses, like the employer, on notice that (1) they had to control hauling and earth moving operations in a manner to ensure equipment operators knew of a worker's location on foot within the immediate vicinity of the operators, and (2) simply informing equipment operators that workers would be on foot in the general area of such operations did not satisfy the requirement. Sufficient evidence supported the Board's finding that the employer could have known with the exercise of reasonable diligence of the condition which violated the regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In granting defendant probation, the Monterey County Superior Court, California, imposed various probation conditions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the constructive knowledge element in three of the probation conditions was not unconstitutionally vague. A condition prohibiting possession of weapons and ammunition contained implicit scienter requirements, and due process did not require making them explicit. The mental element was constitutionally clear without being explicit. Regarding a condition that prohibited the use or possession of &quot;intoxicants,&quot; the court concluded that a scienter element was reasonably implicit in this condition. A &quot;stay away&quot; condition that referred only to &quot;the victim&quot; when there were two victims suffered from a fatal ambiguity in that it did not actually designate from whom defendant should stay away.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile court terminated appellant father's parental rights to his child pursuant to Prob. Code, &sect; 1516.5. The California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Six, reversed and remanded for a determination of the father's rights. The appellate court held the statute unconstitutional as applied to unwed fathers who had demonstrated a full commitment to parental responsibility. Review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that under Adoption of Kelsey S., the rights of a natural father who demonstrated sufficient parental responsibility could not be terminated without a showing of parental unfitness, which was required as a matter of due process. The California Supreme Court concluded that the appellate court misconstrued Kelsey, and that the father was in no position to avail himself of the protections extended by that decision. Prob. Code, &sect; 1516.5, applied to the father no differently than to any other parent, so the equal protection considerations underlying the decision in Kelsey S. were absent. The father, who yielded custody to his parents as guardians, manifestly failed to fulfill his parental responsibilities and did not promptly defend his custodial rights. He also failed to make child support payments, behaved inappropriately and cruelly to the child, abused his visitation rights, and persistently engaged in criminal behavior. The appellate court erred not only by applying Kelsey S., but also by remanding for further proceedings when the father's inability to demonstrate a commitment to parental responsibility was thoroughly demonstrated at the &sect; 1516.5 hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The judgment of the trial court holding that Measure V is invalid is reversed. The case is remanded with directions to enter judgment declaring that the measure is valid.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a citizens' group, sued defendant, Orange County, California, seeking to invalidate &quot;Measure V,&quot; for unconstitutionality, or, if constitutional, on the theory that it was misleadingly described in the ballot materials. The County appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County holding the measure was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen's group challenged the atypical, very short county charter, adopted with the passage of Measure V in the March 2002 primary election. On appeal, the court concluded that the charter literally complied with Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 4, because, by incorporating the general law of California, it provided for each of the requirements in that constitutional provision. And, there was nothing inherently inconsistent with home rule in the idea of county voters choosing to have most of the rules of county government made by the legislature. Further, California election law did not allow a litigant to contest an election on the theory that a 500-word impartial analysis was deficient. While case law did allow the possibility that an impartial analysis could be so misleading and inaccurate that due process required invalidation of the election, any alleged deficiencies in the county counsel's impartial analysis in the case came nowhere near to implicating any constitutional concerns. Finally, the inclusion of a fiscal impact statement was clearly a discretionary matter under the terms of the relevant statute, and the board was well within its discretion not to include one.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court holding that Measure V was invalid was reversed. The case was remanded with directions to enter judgment declaring that the measure was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Superior Court of San Mateo County (California), which modified his probation for sex offenses and imposed new probation conditions, pursuant to amended Pen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sex offenses were committed before the effective date of amended &sect; 1203.067. The court held that the provisions of amended &sect; 1203.067 were improperly applied to defendant because there was no clear legislative intent that the amended statute apply retroactively. Thus, in accordance with Pen. Code, &sect; 3, the new terms and conditions of probation set forth in amended &sect; 1203.067, subd. (b), had to be viewed as unambiguously prospective and could not be imposed on defendant. The court noted that construing the new statute as retroactive would raise ex post facto concerns under U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10, and Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 9, which would be contrary to the rule of interpretation that a statute should be construed to render it free from doubt as to its constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A commissioner of defendant, the Superior Court of San Francisco City and County, California, denied plaintiff's petition for change of gender on her California birth certificate on the basis that Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 103425, required a petitioner to file in the county of residence, and plaintiff resided in Kansas, which did not permit a change of gender on a birth certificate. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court held that the requirement in &sect; 103425 that an individual seeking a new birth certificate file a petition in his or her county of residence acted to deny rights under the statute to the classification of California-born transgender individuals residing outside of California. Those individuals for whose benefit the statute was enacted who resided outside of California were effectively denied the right to issuance of a new birth certificate. Accordingly, &sect; 103425 penalized California-born transgender individuals for moving to a state outside of California, implicating the right to travel under U.S. Const., art. IV, &sect; 2, and U.S. Const., 14th Amend., &sect; 1. The court found no compelling state interest in treating California-born transgender individuals residing out of state differently from California-born transgender individuals residing in California, when either class sought a new California birth certificate. Even if constitutional rights were not implicated, the court found no rational basis for the disparate treatment. Accordingly, the filing requirement denied individuals residing outside California the same rights as individuals residing in California.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and remanded the matter for the petition to be considered on the merits.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect; 1164.5, directing review to the courts of appeal in the first instance, the superior court had jurisdiction to hear a declaratory relief action seeking public access to mandatory mediation and conciliation proceedings because the case was an exceptional case in light of the unavailability of judicial review to a worker who was not a party, the lack of an appellate ruling on the issue, and the persistence of the alleged violation of public access rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed a summary judgment from the Superior Court of Humboldt County (California), which ruled that defendant county had not taken the landowners' property without payment of just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const., 5th Amend., or under Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a provision of its general plan, the county required an overflight easement as a condition for obtaining a building permit for property located in an area near the county's airport. The owners speculated that the easement might cause a decrease in property value if overflight noise substantially increased in the future, but they did not claim any actual loss of property value. The county conceded that the easement would not preclude a takings claim if any actual increase in noise or overflights caused a measurable reduction in the value of the property. The court held that the overflight easement condition did not effect a taking as a matter of law, in light of the county's concession. Accordingly, the essential nexus test, which was a special application of the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, did not apply. Property owners' rights under Civ. Code, &sect; 659, did not include a right to exclude airplanes from using the navigable airspace above their property in accordance with applicable safety regulations, as provided by Pub. Util. Code, &sect; 21403, subd. (a) and 49 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 40102(a)(32), 40103(a). Thus, there was no taking absent proof of noise and disturbance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff advocacy group appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which, after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, dismissed the group's complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of defendant school district's student assignment policies under Cal. Const., art. 1, &sect; 31.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district used neighborhood demographic data to promote diversity in assigning students to schools and academic programs. The policy explicitly stated that the individual personal attributes of students were not relied upon in determining student assignments. To the extent that any preference was given to a student, it was on the basis of several factors relating to the collective composition of the student's neighborhood, which included household income, education level, and race. The court, noting that the burden of proof for a facial constitutional challenge was a heavy one, concluded that the policy was not discriminatory because it did not show partiality, prejudice, or preference to any student on the basis of that student's race. The court stated that Cal. Const., art. 1, &sect; 31, prohibited unequal treatment of particular persons and groups of persons but did not prohibit the collection and consideration of community-wide demographic factors. Nothing in case law precluded educators from considering the overall racial characteristics of neighborhoods in accordance with their authority under Ed. Code, &sect;&sect; 35160, 35160.1, and Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of an order from the Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, which granted respondent medical marijuana collectives' request for a preliminary injunction against the city's enforcement of L.A. Mun. Code, &sect; 45.19.6 et seq., an ordinance regulating the number and geographic distribution of medical marijuana collectives within city limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged ordinance allowed only medical marijuana collectives that had previously registered to continue. The court found no violation of equal protection by the ordinance because the city reasonably could have determined that previous registration was a valid predictor of law-abiding behavior going forward. The hypothetical possibility that some excluded collectives refused to register based not on an inclination towards lawlessness but on a belief that the law had expired, although theoretically &quot;unfair&quot; to some, did not violate equal protection. The ordinance did not provide for its own summary administrative enforcement apart from ordinary lawsuits or criminal prosecutions and thus did not implicate due process concerns. The court found that any expectation of privacy by a collective in the limited, and nonintimate, information sought by the ordinance to be unreasonable. Alternatively, it found any invasion of a reasonable expectation of privacy to be justified by a legitimate and competing state interest. Because respondents did not demonstrate a likelihood of prevailing on the merits at trial, the trial court erred in granting the request for a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order granting the request for a preliminary injunction was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a city clerk and a group that desired to preserve a veterans' memorial site, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which ruled in favor of respondent individual in granting an order that invalidated a local initiative proposition transferring ownership of the site to the federal government.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The site contained a large cross. Two previous attempts by the city to transfer the cross and surrounding parkland to the preservation group were found by the federal courts to be an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The initiative proposition was then placed on the ballot and was approved. The court found that the city clerk and the preservation group had standing as aggrieved parties under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 663, to pursue an appeal because of their involvement with the proposition and the resources spent in its passage. The court noted that San Diego City Charter, art. I, &sect; 1, authorized a transfer of property for a public purpose, such as preserving parkland. The court concluded that the transfer did not establish religion in violation of the First Amendment or Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 4, because it had the valid secular purpose of preserving the historic memorial. There was no agreement that the cross would remain standing after the transfer to the federal government. Moreover, the transfer did not violate the no preference clause of Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 4, or the prohibition against financial support for religion in Cal. Const., art. XVI, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco, California, ordering a refund to plaintiff foreign limited liability company (LLC) of $ 29,540, the entire amount the LLC paid pursuant to Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, former &sect; 17942, for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003, and a postjudgment order awarding attorney fees to the LLC in the amount of $ 215,016.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court concluded that the levy imposed by former &sect; 17942, as applied to the LLC, violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, because the tax was not fairly apportioned. The trial court properly denied the FTB's request that it judicially reform former &sect; 17942 by rewriting it to include an apportionment mechanism. Attempting to rewrite the statute would have constituted judicial policymaking and encroached on the legislative function in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. However, the trial court erred in ordering the FTB to refund the entire amount the LLC paid. Neither federal due process nor California law required the FTB to refund the entire amount the LLC paid. The refund was limited to the amount the LLC paid for the years in issue that exceeded the amount it would have been assessed, without violating the Commerce Clause, using a method of fair apportionment. Reversal of the attorney fees award was necessary because it could not be said with certainty that the trial court would have exercised its discretion the same way had the LLC not prevailed on its contention that it was entitled to a full refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The instant court affirmed the trial court's determination that, as applied to the LLC, former &sect; 17942 violated the Commerce Clause, and that judicial reformation was not an appropriate remedy; reversed the judgment only with respect to the amount of the refund due; reversed the postjudgment order awarding attorney fees to the LLC; and remanded the matter with directions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant domestic partner brought a wrongful death action in May 2002 for medical malpractice in the death of his partner, which occurred prior to January 1, 2002. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, sustained demurrers by respondents, a hospital, doctors, and others, and dismissed the case, finding that the partner did not have standing under the wrongful death statute,&nbsp;Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 377.60. The partner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the action based on Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 377.60, as it existed when the death occurred rather than when the suit was filed. The older version did not provide standing for domestic partners to bring a wrongful death action. In reversing the dismissal, the court of appeal found that two amendments to &sect; 377.60 applied retroactively. As of January 1, 2002, &sect; 377.60(a) was amended to include domestic partners, as defined in Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 297. Effective January 1, 2005, while the case was on appeal, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 377.60(f)(2), was added. That provision explicitly applied to deaths occurring before January 1, 2002, like the one at issue, and provided for wrongful death actions by domestic partners, as defined by Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 297. The court rejected respondents' argument that retroactive application would violate their constitutional right to due process. The state had a significant interest in promoting family relationships by giving rights to domestic partners. The 2005 and 2002 amendments to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 377.60 effectuated that interest and thus could be enforced retroactively without offending due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a deceased patient's domestic partner, appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which sustained defendant health care providers' demurrers to the partner's causes of action, concluding that the partner lacked standing to sue under the 2002 version of the wrongful death statute,&nbsp;Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 377.60 (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partner alleged that the patient died as the result of the providers' medical malpractice. The court held that the 2004 amendment to the wrongful death statute applied retroactively and afforded the partner standing to sue. The providers failed to demonstrate any due process violation because expansion of the class of plaintiffs who could sue for wrongful death did not change the legal definition of negligence, the standard by which liability was assessed, or the character of the defendants' acts or omissions. The amendment also did not violate equal protection because the providers failed to demonstrate that they would be treated differently under the amendment from similarly situated defendants. Moreover, the legislature had a rational basis for amending the statute. For many domestic partners, the incentive to register their partnerships may not have existed prior to January 1, 2002, because of the very limited rights registration afforded. The amendment did not violate the California Defense of Marriage Act, Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 308.5 (2000), because it had nothing to do with marriage. The amendment simply gave the right to sue for wrongful death to certain domestic partners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and judgment of dismissal and remanded the matter for further proceedings. The court directed the trial court to vacate its order sustaining the providers' demurrers, to enter a new order overruling them, and to grant the providers time to file their answers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a marital dissolution case, respondent, the Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, entered an order appointing counsel to represent the parties minor daughter. The trial court also ordered appellant and real party in interest father to advance $100,000 to the minor's counsel as a retainer for her services. The father appealed, while petitioner mother filed a petition for a writ of mandate to have the father's appeal dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court concluded that the trial court did not violate the father's right to advance the minor's best interests. The trial court's order only appointed counsel for the purpose of providing the trial court with additional information; it did not preclude the parties from also informing the trial court what they believed the minor's best interests to be. Counsel's right to reasonable access to the minor was necessary to the minor's legal representation. Accordingly, Fam. Code, &sect; 3151, as applied to the facts presented, did not unconstitutionally infringe on the father's due process rights as a fit parent to decide who could associate with the minor. The trial court properly indicated that it believed the minor's best interests would be served if she had an independent voice, presumably because the parties' perceptions of the minor and her needs were so different that counsel was needed to provide an unbiased perspective. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in appointing counsel. The trial court also did not abuse its discretion in requiring the father to advance $100,000 to the minor's counsel.</SPAN></P>

The minor had seen the half-sibling only occasionally in her life and had never lived with him. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 361.4's prohibition against placing dependent children with individuals who have been convicted of violent felonies is rationally related to the protection of children, as it prevents placement with individuals who have convictions of violence that indicate they present a risk of harm to children in their care. Section 361.4 was enacted in response to situations in which children removed from abusive or neglectful parents suffered abuse or neglect at the hands of their new caregivers. The statute represents the legislature's determination that it would not be in the best interest of the dependent child to be placed with a relative with a disqualifying criminal conviction. The state's compelling interest and obligation to protect children in foster care justified the prohibition against placing the minor with a relative who had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a city, its police department, and the chief of police, filed a petition under Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 8102, to retain and destroy appellant owner's firearms after her release from a facility at which she was detained for psychiatric evaluation under Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 5150, following an alleged suicide attempt. The Superior Court of San Diego County, California, granted the petition, and the owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that substantial evidence supported the trial court's factual conclusion that the owner would not be likely to use firearms in a safe and lawful manner. A mental health evaluation indicated she was under significant stress regarding her health and financial matters. Her niece told an officer that the owner said she was depressed about her health and her car being impounded, wanted to &quot;get it over with,&quot; and was going to shoot herself with a gun but was missing the bullets. The trial court was entitled to disbelieve her claim that she was kidding and that her niece misinterpreted her statements. In addition, her medical records indicated that she was diagnosed with depressive disorder, and a medical evaluation noted that she had emerging stresses, some limited coping skills, and a fairly distant support system, with impaired insight and judgment. The court also held that persons whose firearms were seized and forfeited under Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 8102, fell outside the scope of the Second Amendment, and California could therefore enforce the law to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People charged defendant with possessing marijuana for sale and cultivating marijuana. A jury of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, found defendant guilty of the lesser offense of possessing more than 28.5 grams of marijuana and cultivating marijuana. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial, the prosecutor, relying on Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.77, argued that because defendant possessed 12 ounces of dried marijuana but lacked a recommendation to possess more than eight ounces, defendant was guilty of the charged offenses. The court concluded that the prosecutor's argument was improper because the California Compassionate Use Act (CUA), which allowed qualified patients to obtain and use marijuana for specified medical purposes, could only be amended with voters' approval. However, the voters did not approve the eight-ounce limit in &sect; 11362.77. Hence, &sect; 11362.77&nbsp;unconstitutionally amended the CUA. It was prejudicial error, therefore, to allow the prosecutor to argue that defendant could be found guilty of the charged crimes if he had more than eight ounces of dried marijuana and did not have a doctor's recommendation to have more than that amount. It could not be concluded that the jury found defendant guilty because it believed the amount of marijuana he possessed and cultivated was not reasonably related to his medical needs, as opposed to believing defendant was guilty because he had more marijuana than &sect; 11362.77 said he could have.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeal of California, Second Appellate District, granted judgment in favor of defendant board of chiropractic examiners by upholding the board's findings of misconduct toward plaintiff chiropractor, but reversed the board's order that the chiropractor pay for the prehearing costs of investigation and prosecution. The board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractor argued that Cal. Code Regs., tit. 16, &sect; 317.5 violated his due process rights by encouraging chiropractors accused of misconduct from requesting a hearing on the charges. The appellate court found that the purpose of regulation 317.5 was constitutionally permissible. The regulation's requirement that disciplined chiropractors had to pay costs the board incurred after charges were filed posed a greater risk of causing erroneous deprivations of the right to practice. The regulation was merely discretionary, however, because the administrative law judge had to determine whether the board's costs were reasonable, and the board could reduce or eliminate the cost award. The board could not assess the full costs of investigation and prosecution when to do so would unfairly penalize a chiropractor who committed some misconduct, but who used the process to obtain dismissal of other charges or a reduction in the severity of the discipline imposed. To require the board to reimburse chiropractors who prevailed at disciplinary hearings for their costs would impair its ability to protect the public from chiropractors who injured the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Specifically, appellants claims that the tribal-state gambling agreements, known as compacts, which permitted Indian tribes to conduct gaming prohibited to appellants and others by state law, violated the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2701 et seq., and infringed upon appellants' right to equal protection of the laws. Appellants' complaint pointed out that under various state laws, there were not allowed to conduct Class III games, such as banked games or percentage games, nor were they allowed to operate slot machines. The reviewing court noted that it had to determine whether the facts alleged by appellants and the matters that may have been judicially noticed entitled the state to judgment as a matter of law. The court examined the legislative history of the IGRA. The court held that the rational relationship test applied to the case, rather than the more stringent strict scrutiny test. The court held that the challenged tribal-state compacts was rationally related to the fulfillment of Congress's unique obligation towards Indians and therefore passed constitutional examination under the rational basis test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that state law preempted &sect; 14.16.2205, which made an adjacent landowner liable to third persons who were injured as a result of dangerous conditions on a city-owned sidewalk. The court reversed, finding &sect; 14.16.2205 to be constitutional. The city's adoption of the law was properly within its power as a charter city under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 5 and 7. State law did not preempt San Jose, California, Mun. Code &sect; 14.16.2205, because there was no conflict. Specifically, &sect; 14.16.2205 established a duty on the part of abutting landowners and thus was not duplicative of the California Government Tort Claims Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 810 et seq., which established liability for public entities and their employees. There was also no conflict with Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 5610, which dealt with sidewalk maintenance, or Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1714, which generally addressed liability for negligence in property maintenance. Further, the ordinance did not absolve the city of liability, and it served an important public policy of providing incentives to abutting landowners to maintain the sidewalks adjacent to their property in a safe condition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to lewd conduct on a child under 14, in violation of Pen. Code, &sect; 288, subd. (a), and the Superior Court of Santa Clara County, California, imposed the sex offender probation conditions mandated by Pen. Code, &sect; 1203.067, subd. (b), which required that defendant waive his privilege against self-incrimination for purposes of polygraph examinations and waive his psychotherapist-patient privilege. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that there was no error in imposing the sex offender probation conditions. The probation condition requiring waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination does not violate U.S. Const., 5th Amend., because it does not purport to authorize the use of any statements against a defendant in a criminal proceeding. Further, statements made under the compulsion of the Pen. Code, &sect; 1203.067, subd. (b)(3), condition will necessarily be subject to the penalty exception to the general rule that U.S. Const., 5th Amend., is not self-executing, and therefore will not be admissible against a defendant in a criminal proceeding; thus, the condition will never result in a violation of a defendant's Fifth Amendment rights. The condition also is not overbroad and is reasonably related to preventing a probationer from committing sexual offenses in the future. There was no violation of the right to privacy arising from the condition requiring waiver of any psychotherapist-patient privilege to enable communication between the sex offender management professional and the supervising probation officer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff farm organization and others sued defendant California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and a writ of mandate after SWRCB denied their requests for reconsideration and refund of annual fees imposed by SWRCB. The Sacramento County Superior Court, California, ruled against plaintiffs, finding the fees imposed were valid regulatory fees. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the fees SWRCB collected in the 2003-2004 fiscal year pursuant to Wat. Code, &sect; 1525, were unconstitutional taxes because they were excessive in that they amounted to more than the cost of the regulatory activity. The court concluded that the mere collection of excess fees by SWRCB did not render the authorizing legislation unconstitutional, and that &sect; 1525 was constitutional on its face. However, the annual fees were unlawful as applied by Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, &sect; 1066, because SWRCB failed to show that the charges allocated to a payor bore a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor's burdens on or benefits from the regulatory activity. With respect to the fees imposed on federal contractors pursuant to Wat. Code, &sect;&sect; 1540 &amp; 1565, the court found these statutes constitutional on their face, but it also found the fees were unlawful as applied by Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, &sect; 1073. SWRCB had the authority to impose a regulatory fee on the contractors, but only to the extent of the contractors' contractual interest in water rights permits held by the United States Bureau of Reclamation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the judgment denying plaintiffs' petition for writ of mandate was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions regarding the adoption of new fee schedules and refund of the annual fees unlawfully imposed. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Superior Court of Napa County, California, found defendant guilty of unlawful possession of firearms, in violation of Pen. Code, &sect; 12021, subd. (c)(1), (restricting firearm possession by certain misdemeanants), based on a conviction within the past 10 years for misdemeanor battery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeal held that defendant's conviction did not violate either the right to bear arms or equal protection principles. U.S. Const., 2nd Amend., permitted the government to prohibit all felons (including nonviolent offenders) from possessing firearms, and there was no reason the government could not also prohibit firearm possession by misdemeanants showed a propensity to commit violence. The court disagreed with defendant's characterization of battery as a nonviolent offense. Applying a rational basis analysis, the court also held that &sect; 12021, subd. (c)(1), did not violate equal protection principles, even though it prohibited firearm possession by persons convicted of the California misdemeanors specified in the statute, but not by persons convicted of similar offenses in other jurisdictions. Protecting a defendant's due process rights was a legitimate governmental concern justifying the decision not to include out-of-state misdemeanants because other jurisdictions might not treat misdemeanor crimes, or at least some, with the same level of due process afforded in California. The difficulty of crafting effective legislation was also a legitimate concern.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owners of a stand-alone home furnishings and mattress store located within a planned commercial (PC) district sued defendant city, challenging the validity of Hanford Ordinance No. 03-03, which generally prohibited the sale of furniture in the PC district. The trial court rejected the constitutional challenge, but the California Court of Appeal, Fifth District, found the ordinance to be unconstitutional. The city petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance created a limited exception to the general prohibition on selling furniture in the PC district. The exception permitted large department stores (those with 50,000 or more square feet of floor space) to sell furniture within a specifically prescribed area (occupying no more than 2,500 square feet of floor space) within the department store. The instant court concluded that the ordinance's differential treatment of large department stores and other retail stores was rationally related to one of the legitimate legislative purposes of the ordinance, which was to attract and retain large department stores within the PC district. Because the city viewed large department stores as particularly significant elements of the PC district, and because the management of those stores had made clear the importance to them of retaining their ability to offer furniture sales, it was rational for the city to decide to provide an exception from the general prohibition on furniture sales in the PC district for such large department stores and only such stores. Therefore, the intermediate appellate court erred in finding the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a coordinated proceeding, the trial court ruled in favor of plaintiffs, challengers to California's marriage statutes, and against defendant proponents, holding that the statutes violated the California Constitution insofar as they limited marriage to opposite-sex couples. The Court of Appeal of California reversed the trial court's ruling on the constitutional issue. The California Supreme Court granted further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Fam. Code, &sect;&sect; 300 and 308.5, were unconstitutional insofar as their provisions drew a distinction between opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples and excluded the latter from access to the designation of marriage. The right to marry, as embodied in Cal. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 7, guaranteed same-sex couples the same substantive constitutional rights as opposite-sex couples, including the right to choose one's life partner. The statutes posed a serious risk of denying the official family relationship of same-sex couples equal dignity and respect, a core element of the fundamental right to marry. The statutes also violated California's Equal Protection Clause. In finding that sexual orientation was a suspect classification, the court explained that immutability was not invariably required; rather, the most important factors were historically invidious and prejudicial treatment and a current recognition by society that the characteristic in question generally had no relationship to the ability to perform or contribute to society. The state interest in limiting the designation of marriage exclusively to opposite-sex couples was not a compelling state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged a judgment of the San Francisco County Superior Court (California) that sustained respondent California Franchise Tax Board's (FTB) demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the taxpayers' action for the refund of corporate taxes, in which they asserted that the Multistate Tax Compact, codified at Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, former &sect; 38001 et seq., gave them the option to elect the Compact's apportionment formula.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the taxpayers had standing to pursue the actions. The Compact, at Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, former &sect; 38006, art. III, subd. 1, explicitly gave taxpayers whose income was subject to apportionment and allocation under the laws of a party state the option to elect to apportion their taxes under the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDITPA), codified at Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 25120 et seq., the Compact formula. The Compact was a valid multistate compact, and California was bound by it and its apportionment election provision throughout the years in question because California had not repealed &sect; 38001 et seq. and withdrawn from the Compact during that timeframe. California could not unilaterally repeal compact terms. At the times in question, the Compact superseded Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 25128, such that, contrary to the FTB's assertion, &sect; 25128 could not override the UDITPA election offered to multistate taxpayers in former &sect; 38006, art. III, subd. 1. The FTB's construction violated the federal and state constitutional prohibition against impairment of contracts and also ran afoul of the constitutional reenactment rule in Cal. Const., art. IV, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

The information alleged petitioner and his co-defendants committed murder in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187 (a). The information alleged that the murder was intentional and perpetrated by means of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle, while petitioner was an active participant in a criminal street gang. Although petitioner was technically a juvenile, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 707 (d) gave the prosecutor the discretion to directly file charges against him in adult court. On review, the court determined that &sect; 707 (d) did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. As the power conferred by &sect; 707 (d) was not clearly categorized as judicial or prosecutorial in nature it was within the power of the legislative branch to select which branch should exercise that discretion and under what circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff engineering contractor brought an action against defendant California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), seeking a declaratory judgment that arbitration provisions in the State Contract Act, Pub. Contract Code, &sect; 10240 et seq., were unconstitutional. The San Diego County Superior Court, California, entered judgment in favor of Caltrans after sustaining its demurrer without leave to amend. The contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor contended that the arbitration provisions, on their face and as applied, violated its constitutional rights to a neutral arbitrator, petition the government, and equal protection of the law. The court concluded that there was no support for the contractor's argument that the public works arbitration system necessarily resulted in biased arbitrators. To the contrary, the broad disclosure and disqualification protections provided by the Act and its implementing regulations, as well as the disclosure rules of Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1281.9, provided assurance that an arbitrator would be neutral and acceptable to both parties. A single party did not have the authority to select the arbitrator. Instead, the contractor and Caltrans had to come to an agreement on the arbitrator (or a judge selected the arbitrator), and then each party had a right to strike an arbitrator for any discloseable circumstance, including if the arbitrator had worked for Caltrans in the prior five years. That system provided strong incentive for an arbitrator to be fair to both parties if he or she desired future arbitration work.</SPAN></P>

The victim testified to other incidents where defendant hit her, choked her, or threatened to kill her. During her testimony, the court admonished the jury that evidence of defendant's past conduct could only be considered for a limited purpose. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Since it was ultimately proper for the jury to consider defendant's past conduct as evidence bearing on his present conduct, any errors committed at the trial level were clearly harmless. The proper standard for proving past conduct was by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt, as defendant proposed; therefore, the evidence of defendant's past conduct was sufficiently established by the testimony of the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord appealed an order of the San Francisco County Superior Court (California) denying his petition for writ of mandate, brought against defendant, the San Francisco Residential Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Board, to overturn a regulatory provision governing the circumstances under which a landlord can evict a tenant, who replaces a departing cotenant, in violation of a clause prohibiting sublet and assignment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord argued that the rent board lacked the authority to issue San Francisco, Cal., Residential Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Board Regulation &sect; 6.15A. He claimed that the San Francisco Board of Supervisors did not delegate authority to the rent board to issue regulations modifying the grounds for evictions in the city's rent ordinance. The court determined that the landlord's contention was not supported by a fair reading of the rent ordinance, which granted the rent board broad powers to fashion the regulations needed to achieve the goals of the rent ordinance. Contrary to the landlord's contention, &sect; 6.15A did not conflict with the Leno amendments which revised San Francisco, Cal., Rent Ordinance &sect;&sect; 37.2(g) and 37.9(a)(2). Although &sect; 6.15 applied to preexisting rental agreements, it did not substantially impair contract rights, but was moderate and restrained, eliminating contractual prohibitions to sublet only in carefully tailored circumstances. Section 6.15 also promoted a legitimate and significant public purpose and bore a rational relationship to the legitimate goals of maintaining adequate and affordable rental housing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying plaintiff's petition for writ of mandate was affirmed. The board was awarded its costs for this appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action arising from defendant union's picket at the entrance area and apron of plaintiff grocery store, the Superior Court of Sacramento County, California, denied injunctive relief to the store under Lab. Code, &sect; 1138.1, and the Moscone Act, Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 527.3. The store appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the state could not, based on the content of speech, force the owner or possessor of real property that was not a public forum to give an uninvited group access to the private property to engage in speech. Such legislation violated the First Amendment and therefore was invalid. In the current case, the entrance area and apron of the grocery store comprised a private area because they were not designed and presented to the public as public meeting places, even though other groups had been allowed to use the area for speech. Both &sect; 1138.1 and the Moscone Act violated the First Amendment by favoring speech related to labor disputes over other types of speech. To render it constitutional, the Moscone Act had to be read to allow speech, in a private forum, related to a labor dispute only to the extent that speech related to other issues was allowed. Given the very limited nature of &sect; 1138.1, the proper remedy as to that statute was simply to invalidate it. The store was entitled to a preliminary injunction. The unquantifiable loss of business caused by a union's activities on a business's property could constitute irreparable harm as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded with instructions to grant the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city adopted Monrovia, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 9.28.030, which prohibited school-age children from being in public places other than school between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. on days when school was in session. The opponents filed an action challenging the facial validity of the ordinance. The trial court held that the ordinance was a valid police power ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed. The ordinance did not regulate the conduct of the truant who stayed home or left the city limits. It made it unlawful for a child who was supposed to be in school to be unsupervised in a public place. This was a classic exercise of the city's police power, not a truancy provision or education ordinance. The ordinance was not coextensive with, and therefore not duplicative of, State education law. The ordinance did not conflict or interfere with the enforcement of State laws regulating truancy. There was no indication that the Legislature had expressly or by implication sought to fully occupy the field of regulating off-campus juvenile activity during school hours. The ordinance was a proper exercise of the city's police power and was not preempted by State law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part, holding that the evidence was sufficient to support the aiding and abetting convictions, that guilt based on the natural and probable consequences theory was not dependent upon knowledge that the perpetrator was armed, and that the sentencing enhancement for aiders and abettors in gang cases was not unconstitutional.

Appellant father filed an application to vacate registration of the support order, asserting the equitable defenses of laches and estoppel. Concluding that Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 4502(c) eliminated the defense of laches in this case, the Superior Court of Shasta County (California) confirmed the registration of the child support order. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the hearing on the matter, the mother testified that no child support payments were made. The father testified that all child support payments were made. The parties called corroborating witnesses supporting their respective testimony. The trial court confirmed the registration of the support order, finding that the father had not established that the child support was paid. The trial court also held that &sect; 4502(c) eliminated the defense of laches in this case. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court concluded that &sect; 4502(c), barring an obligor spouse from asserting the defense of laches in an action to recover child, family, or spousal support, applied retroactively to facts that occurred before its enactment. Additionally, the court rejected the father's argument that the elimination of the defense of laches violated his right to &quot;substantive due process.&quot; The court stated that the protection of the welfare of the children of California through the vehicle of child support was a proper legislative goal and an important governmental interest. Section 4502(c) was reasonably related to that goal and therefore the statute passed muster under the substantive due process test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2003, respondents, former residents of a home for orphans and children from broken families, sued appellant, the owner of the home, for negligent hiring, supervision, or retention, alleging that they were sexually abused in 1968 by the husband of a houseparent and in 1976 by an employee. A jury of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, awarded damages. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the degree of knowledge or notice necessary to revive a lapsed claim under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 340.1, subd. (c). The instruction improperly allowed the jury to find that the extended statute of limitations applied if the owner had actual notice of circumstances that would have alerted a prudent person to investigate or if it found that the unlawful sexual conduct was so obvious and pervasive that any reasonably attentive person would have noticed it. The error was prejudicial because it was likely that the jury utilized the erroneous instructions in finding the requisite notice. The court also held that the revival provision did not violate due process, either on its face or as applied, and that no due process violation occurred from the admission of evidence that the owner was unable to rebut due to the passage of time or the exclusion of scientific evidence regarding changes in custom and practice since the time that the abuse occurred. There was also no error in instructing the jury that an agent under &sect; 340.1 could be an actual agent or an ostensible agent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was receiving unsolicited commercial email (UCE) from the advertisers that were deceptive and misleading. The plaintiff alleged causes of action for negligence, trespass, and unfair business and advertising practices. The appellate court reversed the trial court's ruling except to the negligence cause of action. The appellate court held that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 17538.4 did not regulate commerce occurring wholly outside the state, as it expressly applied only when a UCE was sent to a state citizen by an advertiser who had equipment in the state. Further, the advertisers had the ability to determine which of the recipients of the UCE lived in the state in order to comply with the statute. Although UCE's were of little cost to the advertisers, they imposed an economic burden on the recipients in both time and money. The court held that protecting a state's citizens from the economic damage caused by deceptive UCE constituted a legitimate local purpose. Section 17538.4 did not violate the Commerce Clause, as it served a legitimate local public interest and the burden it imposed on interstate commerce was not excessive when viewed in light of its local benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real parties in interest insureds sued petitioner insurer for damages arising out of the Northridge earthquake, seeking punitive damages incident to a bad faith claim.

The insurer sought review by petition for writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer argued that revival of a claim for punitive damages under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 340.9 violated the ex post facto clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court of appeal disagreed, explaining that the prohibition was only against retroactive alteration of penal statutes and finding that punitive damages were not sufficiently penal in intent or effect to trigger the protection of the ex post facto clause. Controlling California authority had held that punitive damages were not penal for ex post facto purposes. The court also considered the issue as though that case were not controlling, however, finding first a legislative intent that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3294 establish civil proceedings. The balance of other factors did not clearly outweigh that intent because punitive damages: (1) did not impose an affirmative restraint or disability; (2) were not historically regarded as penal; (3) did not apply to behavior that was already a crime; and (4) were only imposed in private litigation in which the government was not a necessary party. Because punitive damages were not a penal sanction, their revival under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 340.9 did not violate the ex post facto clause.</SPAN></P>

Proc. &sect; 425.16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer arrested the motorist for suspected drunk driving. After pleading guilty to reckless driving with consumption of alcohol, the motorist filed a citizen complaint against the officer. The motorist alleged that during the arrest the officer had used profanity in speaking to him, had threatened him with physical violence, and had threatened him with three days in jail if he did not take a blood test. The California Highway Patrol determined there was no merit to the motorist's complaint. Subsequently, the officer sued the motorist. The motorist argued that Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 47.5 was unconstitutional because it selectively targeted speech critical of police officers and was an impermissible content-based regulation. The court agreed, concluding that &sect; 47.5 impermissibly regulated speech based on the content of the speech and thus violated the constitutional right of free speech. The statute was not justified by a compelling governmental interest sufficient to overcome its potential for abridgement of constitutional rights, nor was it narrowly tailored, as there were other means to deter false accusations of police misconduct other than allowing an action for defamation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The motorist was awarded costs on appeal and attorney fees in an amount to be determined by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the writ, the appellate court reversed and respondents appealed. The court reversed and held that the enactment was consistent with the doctrine of separation of powers, as it was properly enacted and the enactment expressed a legitimate legislative goal of allocating scarce resources by limiting the agency's regulatory authority. Additionally, the operation of the statute and the budget acts had only a narrow impact upon the executive agency's regulatory scheme and ability to enforce health and safety regulations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, which sustained respondent Franchise Tax Board's demurrers without leave to amend and which dismissed the taxpayers' lawsuit to recover part of their 2006 California state income tax. The tax was imposed by Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 17043, on income that exceeded $ 1 million.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of California's Mental Health Services Act, added by California voters through Proposition 63. The court found no constitutional infirmity in the challenged portions of Proposition 63. An income tax could be rationally based on a taxpayer's income level and ability to pay, and there was no need to show that a particular taxpayer personally benefitted from a tax assessed for the public good. Taxpayers earning more than $ 1 million annually did not comprise a &quot;suspect class&quot; requiring a strict scrutiny constitutional analysis. Further, Proposition 63 was valid even if it was not a constitutional amendment. A rational basis analysis applied to the review of taxation systems. The taxpayers in the instant case did not fall into any forbidden category having no possible connection with the duty to pay taxes. The tax exemption line was drawn at $ 1 million: below that income level, no tax was imposed to fund the Act. The tax was not unconstitutional merely because most people fell within the tax exemption. The taxpayers made no showing that Proposition 63 would destroy or severely limit the legislature's power to formulate a budget.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners sued defendant county for injunctive relief, taxpayer relief, declaratory relief, inverse condemnation, violation of civil rights, and preemption by state law. The Plumas County Superior Court, California, entered judgment in favor of the county after sustaining its demurrer to each of the six causes of action alleged against it without leave to amend. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners contended that their complaint sufficiently alleged an unconstitutional taking based on a county open range ordinance forcing them to accept the physical invasion of their property by their neighbors' cattle. The landowners asserted that their property had been trampled, defecated upon, and damaged by the freely roaming cattle. The court held that the ordinance was not a taking under either the Fifth Amendment or Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 19. The ordinance did not deprive the landowners of all economically beneficial or productive use of their land. The only potential economic burden of the ordinance was the occasional use of and damage to property caused by wandering cattle. The landowners could not show how that limited burden interfered with their reasonable investment-backed expectations in buying that particular property within a traditional open grazing area when they could always avoid it by fencing their property. The ordinance did not itself limit the landowners' best, or any, use of their property. Nor did it extinguish any fundamental attribute of ownership. There was no illegal expenditure by the county in connection with the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a group of voters and aspiring congressional candidates, challenged the constitutionality of the open primary law, Proposition 14, specifically contesting Elec. Code, &sect;&sect; 13105, and 8606. The Superior Court of San Francisco City &amp; County (California) denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of Proposition 14. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Elec. Code, &sect;&sect; 13105 and 8606, were constitutional. The term &quot;party&quot; in Elec. Code, &sect;&sect; 13105, subd. (a), and 8002.5, referred to an organization that was a qualified political party as described in Elec. Code, &sect; 338. Therefore, a candidate's party preference would not be shown on the ballot unless the candidate preferred a qualified party. Candidates who indicated a preference for nonqualified parties would be deemed to not have designated a party preference on their declaration of candidacy, and would be identified on the ballot as having &quot;No Party Preference,&quot; unless they chose to leave the space for a party preference designation blank. Elec. Code, &sect; 8606, precluded the casting of write-in votes at general elections for voter-nominated offices, just as it prohibited the counting of those votes. Elec. Code, &sect; 15340, did not mandate allowance of write-in voting in general elections for voter-nominated offices. There was one election, within the meaning of &sect; 15340, for voter-nominated offices, with two rounds of voting--the primary and general elections-- and allowance of write-in votes at the primary satisfied the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following her criminal conviction, defendant claimed the following points of error: (1) Cal. Penal Code &sect; 273ab was unconstitutional; (2) the trial court erred in the admission and exclusion of scientific evidence and expert testimony and in the failure to give various instructions; and (3) she was denied the right to present relevant evidence corroborative of her theory of defense when the trial court excluded, based on Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 352. The appellate court agreed. The improper mention of a polygraph test, in combination with the error in excluding evidence that defendant's mother had jerked or shaken the child, was prejudicial. Both errors substantially affected the crucial issue in the case, an eyewitness' credibility. The appellate court concluded it was reasonably probable that but for these errors a result more favorable to the defendant would have been reached.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Res. Code &sect;&sect; 30000-30900.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect;&sect; 30301(e), (f) and 30312(a)(1), (2), (b)(1), (2), which governed the appointment and tenure of members of the Commission. The court of appeal found that the statutory scheme created an improper subservience of the Commission to the legislative branch. In response, the legislature amended the pertinent provisions of the Act. The court found that the state constitution did not categorically preclude the legislature from enacting a statutory provision authorizing the legislature itself to appoint a member or members of an executive commission or board. In light of the nature of the Commission's functions, the operative effect of its current appointment and tenure structure, and the numerous safeguards incorporated within the Act that served to ensure that the actions of Commission members were not improperly interfered with or controlled by the legislative appointing authority, the court held that the current provisions did not violate the state constitutional separation of powers clause, Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. Thus, the judgment enjoining the Commission from undertaking the bulk of its statutorily authorized functions could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city's business tax scheme imposed a payroll expense tax and a business license tax upon those engaging in business within defendant's borders, but exempted taxpayers who were subject to either one of the taxes from paying the other. The trial court found defendant's taxing scheme violated state and federal constitutional proscriptions against restraint of commerce with respect to in-city manufacturers selling outside the city, and awarded damages and attorney fees. The court vacated the attorney fee award but otherwise affirmed. The tax scheme directly discriminated against interstate and intercity taxpayers doing business in the city. Also, under the internal consistency test interstate and intercity taxpayers would be presumed to pay two taxes where local taxpayers would pay only one. However, plaintiff was not entitled under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1988 to attorney fees because plaintiff had an adequate state remedy of a tax refund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The San Francisco Superior Court, California, rejected the claim of plaintiff school district that the joint civil service system for city and district employees established by Ed. Code, &sect; 45318, as applied by defendant city, transferred school control to an entity outside the school system, in violation of Cal. Const., art. IX, &sect; 6. The trial court entered judgment for the city and intervenor unions. The district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the City Civil Service Commission's classification and layoff of school district employees, including layoff procedures in which city employees could take school district positions, did not violate Cal. Const., art. IX, &sect; 6, because the commission rules administered under Ed. Code, &sect; 45318, did not divest the district of ultimate control over the schools or any part of the public school system. The school district retained the ability to set the duties of and manage its employees. The district, not the city, was in control of for-cause dismissals, and the district was able to terminate an incoming &quot;bumper&quot; for any reason during that employee's probationary period. The district could also seek to create district-only classifications and impose special qualifications on a citywide classification above and beyond the usual requirement. The court declined to hold that the adoption of Cal. Const., art. IX, &sect; 6, prohibiting the transfer of schools and their operations outside the school system, precluded the delegation of school personnel functions that had been sanctioned by the Legislature just one year previously.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The California Legislature enacted a budget bill by a majority vote and also enacted several spot bills by a majority vote. These spot bills contained no content other than an assigned number and a statement that it would contain statutory changes relating to the budget bill. Substantive content was later added by a majority vote. The mandate petition challenged the validity of one of the spot bills, which gave bond measures and constitutional amendments priority on the ballot. The court observed that the issue was moot because the election already had taken place. Because the enactment of spot bills was a recurring issue of continuing public interest and was likely to evade review, the court opted to consider the merits. The court concluded that the spot bill procedure did not comply with Cal. Const., art. IV, &sect; 12, subd. (e)(2), requiring that bills related to the budget bill be identified as such in the budget bill. Merely assigning a number was insufficient to identify a bill. Accordingly, the ballot priority statute was not an appropriation related to the budget bill within the meaning of Cal. Const., art. IV, &sect; 8, subd. (c), and was not effective at the time of the election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff conservation organization appealed two judgments and an order from the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California), which denied its mandamus petition challenging defendant city's determination that it was not qualified to receive mitigation land; granted summary judgment to defendant developers as to breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and constructive trust; and awarded fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' agreement provided for mitigation land to be transferred to the conservation organization and contained a clause requiring that the city not unreasonably withhold approvals. The court, noting that the approval clause did not alter the standard of review, concluded that the organization had not had demonstrated an entitlement to due process under Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 7, and U.S. Const., 14th Amend., as to qualification. A vagueness argument lacked authority and, in any event, the qualification criteria were not vague. Substantial evidence showed that the organization had not met the criteria. The developers were entitled to rescission based on failure of consideration under Civ. Code, &sect; 1689, subd. (b)(4), mistake under &sect; 1689, subd. (b)(1), impossibility, and frustration of purpose. Approval was an implied condition without which there was no duty to perform under Civ. Code, &sect; 1436. No errors occurred in the trial court's evidentiary rulings. The incorrect assumption that the organization was qualified supported a finding of mistake of fact under Civ. Code, &sect; 1577, subd. (2). Upon rescission, a severability clause had no effect in accordance with Civ. Code, &sect; 1688.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that defendant was properly convicted for multiple counts of using a minor to produce child pornography, based on taking multiple photographs of the victim on one occasion. The plain language of Pen. Code, &sect; 311.4, subd. (c), authorized multiple convictions for each piece of media created, and the statute's legislative history compelled the same conclusion. The purposes of &sect; 311.4 was to prevent the abuse and sexual exploitation of children by extinguishing the market for child pornography, and when a person created multiple photographs of child pornography, the person added to the market more than the person who created one photograph of child pornography. There was no equal protection violation, even if &sect; 311.4 as applied affected similarly situated persons differently, because extinguishing the market for child pornography was a rational basis for treating those who created multiple photographs of child pornography as more culpable than those who, for example, created one lengthy videotape.</SPAN></P>

The California Court of Appeal, Third Appellate District, Division Three, reversed. The objectors to the conservator's request appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A motor vehicle accident injured the conservatee's brain, leaving him conscious yet severely disabled, both mentally and physically, and dependent on artificial nutrition and hydration. The conservator, the wife of the conservatee, proposed to direct the conservatee's physician to remove his feeding tube and allow him to die. The objectors were the conservatee's mother and sister. The trial court applied the clear and convincing evidence and found the evidence insufficient to prove that the conservator's decision was in accordance with either the conservatee's own wishes or best interest. The appellate court believed the trial court was required to defer to the conservator's good faith decision. However, the state supreme court, construing Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 2355, held that the trial court correctly required the conservator to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, either that the conservatee wished to refuse life-sustaining treatment or that to withhold such treatment would have been in the conservatee's best interest. Lacking such evidence, the trial court correctly denied the conservator's request for permission to withdraw artificial hydration and nutrition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sued respondents, the board of retirement for a county employees' retirement system and an association of county deputy sheriffs, claiming that an enhanced retirement formula for prior years of service adopted in 2001 by the county board of supervisors violated the California Constitution. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) entered judgment in favor of respondents. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the county committed to paying increased benefits over time when it approved the enhanced benefit for the association members, but the unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) was not a certain total for which the county was immediately liable. The past service portion of the 3 percent at 50 enhanced retirement formula was not extra compensation in violation of Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 10. The association members' contractual pension expectations included not only those benefits in effect when they accepted employment, but also those conferred during their tenure. Therefore, when the county board of supervisors approved the increase to 3 percent at 50 to take effect on June 28, 2002, the vested rights of the association members employed on that date included the enhanced pension benefit formula, which was conferred during their employment. The 3 percent at 50 resulted in increased benefits upon retirement, but was not additional compensation. Instead, it altered the prior pension benefits and perhaps provided an incentive to retire. The county board of supervisors in 2001 did precisely what Gov. Code, &sect; 31678.2, authorized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant former husband appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which vacated its provisional order sealing 28 pleadings in a divorce proceeding initiated by plaintiff former wife and held that Fam. Code, &sect; 2024.6, was unconstitutional. The press had intervened to oppose the husband's application under &sect; 2024.6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were considered to be people of high public interest. The husband requested that the court seal documents such as his income and expense declaration, notices of lis pendens, motions to which the parties' post-marital agreement was an exhibit, pleadings that contained street addresses of real property, a motion for summary adjudication, and discovery motions. The court held that the presumption of openness applicable to substantive courtroom proceedings in ordinary civil cases applied to court records in divorce proceedings. The mandated sealing under &sect; 2024.6 of location and identifying information about assets and liabilities was supported by constitutionally guaranteed privacy rights, and the court deferred to legislative findings on the probability of prejudice, in the form of identity theft and the like, to the privacy interest protected by the statute. However, the statute, on its face, was a constitutionally impermissible burden on the First Amendment right of public access to court records because it was neither narrowly tailored to serve the privacy interest being protected, nor was it the least restrictive means of protecting those interests.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect;&sect; 1164-1164.13's mandatory mediation and conciliation (MMC) process because an employer, in defending against a union's request to institute the MMC process, could challenge the union's status as the employees' bargaining representative by raising a claim of abandonment based on the union's conduct; [2]-The MMC statute on its face violates equal protection principles; [3]-The MMC statute constitutes an improper delegation of legislative authority because it leaves the resolution of fundamental policy issues to others and fails to provide adequate direction and safeguards for the implementation of that policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Superior Court of Orange County, California, found defendant guilty of attempted unlawful assault weapon activity and attempted possession of an assault weapon, in violation of Pen. Code, &sect; 664, subd. (a), and former &sect; 12280, subds. (a)(1), (b), based on evidence that defendant was making an AK-47 from a kit. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his conviction was invalid in the absence of evidence that the AK-47 was fully assembled and enabled to fire repeated shots without reloading manually. The court of appeal disagreed, emphasizing that defendant was convicted only for attempt. Evidence that he obtained a kit to build an AK-47, familiarized himself with instructions on a Web site, and took at least one step towards assembly was sufficient to support the attempt convictions. The information available to defendant on the Internet was not scant, and defendant admitted to an officer that he knew it was wrong to make and possess his own AK-47. Had police not intervened, defendant would have completed the assembly. The court also held that the statutes were not unconstitutionally vague as applied; that defendant's possession of a.50-caliber weapon and ammunition was properly admitted to support an inference that he had the intent to possess a fully assembled AK-47; and evidence that he possessed both a.50-caliber rifle he had assembled himself, plus two types of.50-caliber ammunition, was relevant to show that he was familiar with high-powered firearms and their assembly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, employees of a gambling establishment, sued defendant City of San Jose for declaratory relief. The employees sought a declaration that the City's Gaming Control Regulatory Ordinance was unconstitutional. They alternatively sought a declaration that the ordinance was unenforceable because state law preempted it. The Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California) granted the City's motion for summary judgment. The employees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees contended that the Gaming Control Regulatory Ordinance, San Jose, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 16.02.010 et seq., which required the employees to be licensed, was unconstitutional because it transgressed their right of privacy. Although the City failed to incorporate privacy safeguards into the Ordinance, the court was able to construe it so as to avoid potential constitutional problems. Therefore, the court modified the trial court's judgment, stating that before the City disclosed personal information collected under the Ordinance, it had to take reasonable steps to notify the person to whom the information pertained of the pendency and nature of the request for the information and to afford the person a fair opportunity to object to disclosure, to join in resisting disclosure, or to institute appropriate legal proceedings to resist disclosure or limit the scope or nature of the matters sought to be discovered. The court also held that, pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 19803, local authorities were not precluded from imposing more stringent local controls or conditions upon gambling than were imposed by the Gambling Control Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 19800 et seq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, several nonprofit organizations and the City and County of San Francisco, California, initiated an action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief on the ground that Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 25373, 37361 were facially invalid to the extent that these laws granted noncommercial property owned by religious organizations an exemption from historic landmark designation and regulation. The trial court agreed and the court of appeals reversed. On appeal, the court upheld the statutes against establishment clause challenges. The exemption in question sought only to relieve religious entities of a potential burden on free exercise of religion. Inasmuch as the legislature could reasonably believe that landmark designation could result in denying the owner the economic benefit and use of the property necessary to fulfill the owner's religious mission, the exemption authorized by Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 25373, 37361 met the secular purpose prong under the Lemon test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which, in a jury trial, convicted defendant of first degree murder, in violation of Pen. Code, &sect; 187, subd. (a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After reaching a verdict, the jury asked to be allowed to leave the courtroom without speaking to anyone. The trial court accommodated the jury's request after the verdict was read and recorded, allowing the jury to exit through a private corridor and leaving the jurors unavailable to speak to the parties. The defense was not made aware of the jury's request before the jury departed. Defendant's petition to unseal the confidential juror identifying information was denied. The court held that defendant's failure to object waived his argument that he and defense counsel were absent at a critical stage of the proceedings; moreover, even if that argument had been preserved, it was meritless. The court found no violation of substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment in the trial court's application of Code Civ. Proc., &sect;&sect; 237, 206, to protect the privacy of the jurors. Preventing defendant from questioning the jury about its deliberative process after the verdict had been reached did not deny defendant his right to an impartial jury because there was no infringement of a historical component of an impartial jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that: (1) the finding of a probation violation of &sect; 311.11 was unconstitutional; (2) evidence of &quot;apparent age&quot; of male and female actors appearing in video clips engaging sexual activity should have been restricted to that which was competent to establish true chronological age; (3) the trial court should have sustained defendant's objection to the testimony of a prosecution expert witness; and (4) the evidence was insufficient to establish that defendant had knowledge that the actors were under 18 years of age. The instant court concluded there was no constitutional infirmity in &sect; 311.11, as the statute required a real minor and required knowledge of minority status by the perpetrator. Expert witness testimony was both relevant and admissible. Apparent age and actual appearance were simply forms of evidence allowable to prove the fact that the actors were under the age of 18. Defendant's statement to a law enforcement officer was sufficient to prove that he had knowledge of the minority status of the actors in the video clips he possessed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a convicted felon, was convicted by a jury of the Superior Court of Ventura County (California) of violating Pen. Code, former &sect; 12370, subd. (a), which proscribed the possession of body armor by a person who had been convicted of a violent felony. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that former &sect; 12370, subd. (a), was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Pen. Code, former &sect; 12370, subd. (a), satisfied the fair notice component of due process and also satisfied the due process component of providing a standard for police enforcement and for ascertainment of guilt. A person who knowingly acquired a bulletproof vest after having been convicted of a violent felony was neither innocent nor was the person without fair warning if the vest turned out to be proscribed body armor. Moreover, the statute could not be more precise as a standard for law enforcement. Even though he did not read former &sect; 12370, subd. (a), and Cal. Code Regs., tit. 11, it was reasonable to infer that petitioner knew that his possession of the bulletproof vest was a crime. He told his girlfriend that, because of his prior felony convictions, he was not allowed to be around any body armor, and the vest itself had a label that stated &quot;body armor.&quot; Thus, even if a theoretical case could be made for vagueness, and the court did not believe it could, former &sect; 12370, subd. (a), was not vague as far as petitioner was concerned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a petition to establish paternity of twins and for an order awarding him joint custody and reasonable visitation, as well as genetic testing to determine his status as the twins' biological father. Respondents, the twins' mother and her husband, moved to quash the petition. The San Diego County Superior Court, California, granted the motion to quash and dismissed the action. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant asserted that his relationship with the twins began in utero while he attended to the mother's neonatal care and sang or talked to the unborn children. The court concluded that the Uniform Parentage Act precluded appellant from bringing a paternity action and from compelling the mother and the children to submit to blood tests to resolve the question of biological parenthood. Appellant, who never married nor attempted to marry the mother, and never received the twins into his home despite considerable efforts to do so, could not attain presumed father status under Fam. Code, &sect; 7611. Thus, even assuming appellant qualified as an &quot;interested party&quot; under Fam. Code, &sect; 7630, subd. (b), his action would appear neither to affect the husband's status as a presumed father, nor to confer on appellant presumed father status. Appellant's proposed prenatal relationship theory viewed the relationship from the alleged father's perspective, not the child's, and thus did not advance the policy considerations recognizing the value to the child of an established parent-child relationship. Appellant's equal protection challenges were waived for failure to raise them in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

It was also unpersuaded by his argument that the judgment had to be reversed, as the jury was improperly instructed regarding the requisite mental state, and the trial court made improper comments to the jury following closing arguments. The code section for rape of an intoxicated person was not unconstitutionally vague. The use of the reasonableness standard did not make the statute uncertain. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the statute eliminated the mens rea requirement by including in its reach one who reasonably should have known the victim's intoxication prevented resistance. The statute did not eliminate the knowledge requirement; rather, it set a standard of knowledge or constructive knowledge. Defendant's contention that his conviction had to be reversed, because the jury instruction included the reasonably should have been known language and thus impermissibly allowed the jury to convict him on the basis of civil negligence without a finding of criminal culpability, was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retirees filed a mandamus action against respondent Regents of the University of California, claiming, inter alia, that the elimination of their university-sponsored group health insurance benefits was an unconstitutional impairment of either an express or implied contract the Regents had formed with them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retirees had spent decades working at a laboratory operated by the University of California. The court held that the retirees had adequately pleaded a cause of action for breach of an implied contract because they claimed that the university's obligation to provide lifetime retiree medical benefits to them on the same terms as other university retirees could be implied from the authorization of those benefits in 1961, the uninterrupted provision of those benefits for more than 50 years, and from the university's publications assuring employees they would receive health benefits in retirement so long as they met certain eligibility requirements. The retirees' interpretation of the benefits booklets was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment to the extent it dismissed the retirees' claim for impairment of express contract. In all other respects, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife had been convicted of domestic violence against the husband. The parties' settlement agreement provided that spousal support was not subject to modification or termination, but the trial court found applicable and unrebutted the presumption of Fam. Code, &sect; 4325, that an award of spousal support not be made to a spouse convicted of intraspousal domestic violence. The instant court concluded that the public policy against enforcement of the nonmodifiable spousal support provision outweighed any interest in its enforcement. Although the wife would forfeit a substantial amount of spousal support if the provision was not enforced, it could not be reasonably expected that the husband would finance his own abuse by the wife. Refusal to enforce the provision would further the public policy against domestic violence because the wife would have fewer financial resources to continue harassing the husband. There was a direct connection between the wife's misconduct and the spousal support provision. Therefore, the trial court did not err in concluding that the wife failed to rebut the presumption of &sect; 4325.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an uninsured motorcyclist, appealed from Superior Court of the County of San Joaquin, California, which held that under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.4, enacted through citizen initiative, plaintiff's uninsured status precluded him from seeking noneconomic damages against defendant, a private packing company which negligently created a dangerous condition that caused plaintiff to collide with the side of a truck, rendering him a paraplegic.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff uninsured motorcyclist was traveling on his motorcycle as he approached two semi-trailers parked on the right shoulder of the road. When an unseen truck pulled into his path from in front of the trailers, the motorcyclist collided with it, sustaining serious injuries. A jury found that the packing company's negligence in placement of the trailers was the cause of the accident and awarded special damages, but was precluded by an in limine order from awarding noneconomic damages. The appellate court agreed that the motorcyclist's action fell squarely within the prohibitory language of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3333.4, enacted through passage of Proposition 213, The Personal Responsibility Act of 1996. The statute was not clearly, positively, and unmistakably unconstitutional. Its classification of uninsured motorists was not based on a suspect classification and did not touch on fundamental rights. The classification was rationally related to its objective of treating differently those who knowingly chose to violate the law (e.g., by driving without insurance) from those who complied with their legal financial responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile was adjudged a ward of the court, and after other placements were terminated and a probation violation was sustained, the Superior Court of Contra Costa County, California, ordered that he be temporarily housed at the Division of Juvenile Facilities (DJF), pursuant to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 1752.16, to be returned to the county when he completed treatment or on his 21st birthday. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal concluded that insufficient evidence supported the order that defendant be housed at the DJF because Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 1752.16, requires a contract between the county and the DJF and there was no evidence of such a contract. The insufficiency was not overcome by the presumption that the trial court was aware of and followed the applicable law. The court also held that the juvenile court was authorized to impose conditions of probation because the temporary placement at the DJF was not a commitment to the custody of the DJF and thus did not remove defendant from the supervision of the court. However, several conditions of probation were unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, including a prohibition of the possession of &quot;telecommunications access&quot; to pornography in the form of computer applications; a condition that failed to convey what distinguished a &quot;closed and locked down&quot; wireless network from an &quot;open&quot; network; a blanket prohibition on possession of pornography; and a requirement of adult supervision for contact with minors that did not specify the scope of supervision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the court's order that defendant be housed at DJF, along with provisions of the court's order that were dependent on that disposition, reversed several conditions of probation, otherwise affirmed the order, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Department of Personnel Administration, its Director, the California Department of Forestry Firefighters, and the unions, appealed judgments of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which granted plaintiffs, the state attorneys, a citizen taxpayer, and the California State Personnel Board (SPB), writs of mandate prohibiting implementation of the disciplinary provisions of memorandums of understanding (MOUs).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state civil service employees represented by unions negotiated MOUs or labor contracts with the Departments. The taxpayer, SPD, and state attorneys were granted mandamus relief against the implementation of the MOUs. The court concluded that the SPB had standing under the public right test to challenge the MOUs, which violated Cal. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(a), because they restricted the SPB's adjudicatory authority to review major and minor disciplinary actions taken against the employees. The implementing legislation,&nbsp;Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 18670(c)-(e), 19574(c), (d), 19575(b), 19576.5, 19582(f)-(h), and 19582.1, violated Cal. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(a), to the extent that it sanctioned the offending provisions of the MOUs. The court held that the MOUs and legislation authorized employees to elect a grievance procedure in lieu of SPB review and encumbered the grievance procedure with procedures that failed to protect the merit principle. Because SPB review of disciplinary actions was not limited to review by way of appeal, the court directed the deletion of the condition in one judgment that barred implementation unless and until provisions were made for SPB's review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments against the Departments, Director, and unions and in favor of the taxpayer, state attorneys, and SPB in the three consolidated appeals, with the exception that the condition attached to one judgment was deleted. The court dismissed, as moot, the SPB's appeal from a decision that it did not have standing to challenge an MOU that was found to be invalid.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that the statute was not facially unconstitutional, but mandated that a person seeking visitation with a child when the parents opposed visitation had to show by clear and convincing evidence that the decision to withhold visitation would be detrimental to the child. The supreme court further held that, although the statute was not facially unconstitutional, it was unconstitutional as applied to the mother. If found that the trial court had improperly imposed its own subjective views of the child's best interest over those of the mother. The trial court did not make any findings to support its best interest determination other than that the grandparents loved the child and had gone through extraordinary efforts to maintain the relationship with their granddaughter in the face of noncooperation by the mother. Application of &sect; 3104 to the mother violated her due process right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to a criminal trial, the People sought to amend an information to allege aggravating circumstances listed in Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.421, and secure a jury trial of those alleged aggravating circumstances. The Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, sustained defendant's special demurrer to the amended information. The People sought a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to reverse its order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court observed that the state's high court had disapproved of a similar procedure in People v. Sandoval, a case decided after the People filed their petition in the instant case. The court disagreed that the People should be permitted to amend an information to assert aggravating circumstances. Even though Sandoval expressly applied only to resentencing proceedings, its rationale describing the difficulties and potential constitutional concerns inherent in a jury trial was equally applicable to defendant's case. Just as in Sandoval, a jury trial on the aggravated circumstances alleged by the prosecutor and listed in Rule 4.421 would clothe the prosecutor with a form of discretion the legislature intended to be exercised by the trial court and would introduce to the jury imprecise standards and ones requiring comparative evaluation. To amend the information, the People sought to rely on a rule of court not drafted with a jury in mind. Many of the aggravating circumstances described in the rules required an imprecise quantitative or comparative evaluation of the facts. Therefore, the trial court correctly struck the allegations of aggravating circumstances in the information.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with attempting to violate Cal.

Petitioner challenged the statute as unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and under the free speech provisions of U.S. Const. amend. I. The court rejected petitioner's contention. As a California resident, who was alleged to have engaged in strictly intrastate communications, petitioner could not assert that application of Cal. Penal Code &sect;288.2(a) to him posed a burden on interstate commerce. Further, the California statute did not implicate petitioner's free speech rights, because the activity prohibited by the ordinance was far more akin to conduct than communication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court found that defendant tobacco company had violated Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 118950, by distributing free cigarettes at six different events held on public property and imposed a fine of $ 14,826,200 against the company. The California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Two, affirmed the judgment. The company petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the company's conduct was not protected by a safe harbor provision provided in &sect; 118950, subd. (f), because minors were present at the events, even though they were excluded from booths or tents where the free cigarettes were distributed. The statute banned the nonsale distribution of cigarettes at events held on public property where adults and minors were present. Limiting the events at which cigarettes could be freely distributed furthered the legislature's goals to keep children from starting to use tobacco products and to encourage smokers to quit. Finding no clear and manifest purpose of Congress to bar state regulation of the nonsale distribution of cigarettes to minors or adults, the court further concluded that &sect; 118950 was not preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. However, the court found that the $ 14,826,200 fine against the company may have violated federal and state constitutional prohibitions against excessive fines. The company's good faith or bad faith was relevant to determining the amount of the fine that the company might have to pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed to the extent that it imposed a fine of $ 14,826,200 against the company, and the case was remanded with directions regarding assessment of the fine. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two plaintiffs appealed a judgment of the Alameda County Superior Court, California, which dismissed their childhood sexual abuse complaint against defendant church bishop on the ground the statute purporting to revive their previously dismissed complaints, Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 340.1, violated California's constitutional separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued the bishop in July 2003, alleging that they had been the victims of sexual abuse by one of its parish priests in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when they were both minors. Plaintiffs had each sued the bishop before, but their complaints were dismissed in 1994 and 1995, respectively, under the then-applicable one-year statute of limitations. Noting that this case involved judgments that the legislature had subjected to a reopening device that did not exist when those judgments were pronounced, the court concluded that the legislature violated the separation of powers doctrine when it amended &sect; 340.1 to revive childhood sex abuse actions because final judgments had been entered in the earlier actions under the statute of limitations that previously existed. Once the judgments against plaintiffs in the previous actions were upheld on appeal, they became final for separation of powers purposes and could not be legislatively revived. Because the power to conclusively resolve cases by rendering dispositive judgments rested with the judiciary alone, the legislature could not reverse final judgments that were rendered under the previous limitations period of &sect; 340.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Code, &sect; 4706.5, subd. (a), notwithstanding the city's payment of $ 104,208 in death benefits to a decedent's estate pursuant to Lab. Code, &sect; 4702, subd. (a)(6)(B).</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect;&sect; 3501 through 3503. The decedent died intestate. The court held that the escheat of a death benefit to the State after partial payment to the estate of a deceased worker - in effect, the award of two death benefits for a single death - was inconsistent with the governing statutes and the legislative policy they implemented. The DWD Unit was not entitled to a partial payment of the death benefit. Although including the estate of an employee in the class of dependents entitled to recover a death benefit under &sect; 4702, subd. (a), had been invalidated, the legislature required those payments and intended, when made, that they would displace any obligation to the DWD Unit. Because the city paid the decedent's estate pursuant to &sect; 4702, subd. (a)(6)(B), no payment at all was due the DWD Unit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People contended that the trial court erred in ruling that the STEP Act did not apply when the only alleged gang activity was felony vandalism and in ruling that application of the STEP Act to real parties in interest would be unconstitutional. The court granted the People's petition for a writ of mandate, concluding that the STEP Act allegations were properly included in the indictment. The court stated that the legislature intended the STEP Act to apply to a group &quot;whose only alleged criminality&quot; was engaging in the crime of felony vandalism. The court also rejected the contention by real parties in interest that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 186.22 violated their substantive due process rights because it reached conduct that did not rationally relate to the legislature's stated purpose of the STEP Act. The court stated that it saw nothing unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious in applying the STEP Act to felony vandalism.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff guest filed a class action lawsuit against defendant hotel. The gravamen of the complaint was that the hotel failed to give members of the public notice of its valet parking charge. The Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, entered summary judgment in the hotel's favor. The guest appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guest's complaint was based on two theories: (1) valet parking at the hotel violated provisions of a city's municipal code that governed the size and very specific location of signs for parking charges at a vehicle parking facility; and (2) independent of the municipal code, the hotel failed to provide him notice of the $ 21 a night charge for valet parking during his stay at the hotel. After the guest filed the original complaint, the city council amended the code provision regarding vehicle parking facilities. The amended ordinance provided that a vehicle parking facility did not include an off-street parking facility accommodating the parking of motor vehicles by the occupants, customers, clientele, and employees of an on-site or adjacent structure where the primary use of that structure was for office, retail, or hotel purposes. The instant court concluded that the amended ordinance was intended to operate retroactively. Application of the amended ordinance to existing causes of action was not constitutionally prohibited. The trial court properly ruled a parking ticket provided sufficient notice of the parking charge and the public was not likely to be deceived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The hotel was awarded costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the director of the Department of Finance, appealed a summary judgment entered by the Superior Court of Sacramento County, California, in favor of plaintiff Teachers' Retirement Board (TRB), as manager of the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), and intervenor retired teachers association. The trial court found that provisions of Senate Bill 20 (SB 20) constituted an unconstitutional impairment of contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">TRB and the association challenged the awards of prejudgment and postjudgment interest. The court found that the trial court correctly determined that the matter was ripe for adjudication. Both the plain language of Ed. Code, &sect; 22954, and the legislative history indicated that Assem. Bill. No. 1102 (AB 1102) contractually obligated the State to make an annual contribution of 2.5 percent of creditable compensation into the Teachers' Retirement Fund's Supplemental Benefit Maintenance Account (SBMA). Withholding statutorily mandated sums to fund pension benefits was an impairment of contract. Reducing the income stream available to pay the supplemental benefits by $500 million increased the risk to CalSTRS members that the SBMA funds would be insufficient to make the supplemental benefit payments in the future. SB 20 did not compensate the members for that increased risk or provide a comparable new advantage in place of the $500 million. As a result, SB 20 impaired the contractual rights bestowed by AB 1102 in violation of the California and U.S. Constitutions. The trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest at a rate of seven percent, rather than 10 percent, per annum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's judgment to increase the rate of prejudgment interest to 10 percent per annum. As so modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had a policy requiring that access to marina facilities could not be predicated on a person's religion, sexual orientation, and other characteristics. Because the group was associated with a national organization that had a policy of excluding homosexuals and atheists, the city asked the group to provide written assurances that it would not discriminate against homosexuals or atheists wishing to participate in its program. The group stated that it did not ask its members about their sexual orientation, but it was unwilling to declare that it would not, in the future, discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. The city, deeming the group's statement ambiguous and therefore insufficient, discontinued its subsidy. The court held that the city's refusal to subsidize discriminatory activities did not infringe the group's exercise of speech or associational rights. The city's nondiscrimination policy did not prohibit the group from privately operating in a discriminatory manner and did not demand adherence to a particular philosophy. Requiring assurances that the group would not engage in the same discriminatory activities as its national organization was permissible.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court denied the application for a writ. The court observed that the trial court had indeed erred in entering judgment without reviewing the pleadings, as violation of the pre-read rule did not waive petitioner's right to pre-reading. The court should either have read the pleadings or continued the matter rather than ruling as it did.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of San Diego County, California, found defendant guilty under Pen. Code, former &sect; 12280, subd. (b) (renumbered as Pen. Code, &sect; 30605), a provision of California's Assault Weapons Control Act (AWCA), based on his possession of an AK series semi-automatic rifle. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that the ban on specified semi-automatic assault weapons under the AWCA does not violate the Second Amendment, agreeing with prior case law that assault weapons are at least as dangerous and unusual as the short-barreled shotgun previously found to be outside the scope of the Second Amendment's guarantee. Because the AWCA does not impose a burden on conduct falling within the scope of the Second Amendment's guarantee, it was not necessary to analyze the validity of the law under either strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny. It was also not necessary to make an exception for possession of assault weapons within the homes of otherwise law-abiding citizens for self-defense. When a weapon falls outside the class of weapons entitled to Second Amendment protections, neither the place in which it is stored nor the purposes for which it might be used imbues the weapon with Second Amendment protections. The fact some weapon models with characteristics similar to defendant's weapon may have escaped the assault weapons ban did not invalidate the ban.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the owner and developer of an affordable senior housing development, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California), which denied its petition for writ of mandate challenging an administrative determination by respondent, the Director of the California Department of Industrial Relations, that the project was a public work under Lab. Code, &sect; 1720, requiring payment of prevailing wages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The project was funded with a combination of redevelopment housing funds and two low-interest public loans. The court held that the project was a public work and was subject to the prevailing wage requirements of the California Labor Code. The project did not qualify for exemption under &sect; 1720, subd. (c)(4), because its public funding did not consist solely of redevelopment housing funds. The project also failed to qualify for the &sect; 1720, subd. (c)(6)(E), exemption because it relied on public funding other than low-interest public loans. The court found both statutory exemptions unambiguous and stated that the Legislature did not intend for the two exceptions to operate together. Although the owner cited public policy considerations in favor of affordable housing as a reason to read the two subdivisions together, the court observed that such considerations were for the Legislature. Read together, the statutory exemptions and the director's determination provided fair notice to the public of the standards a project had to meet for the exemptions to apply. Accordingly, the determination did not render the exemptions so vague as to result in a due process violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

After a trial, judgment was rendered for defendants, the Board of Equalization of the State of California and others. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The other tobacco sellers withdrew their appeal, but the remaining plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the California Children and Families Act of 1998, Cal. Prop. &sect; 10 (1998), which imposed taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products and allocated the revenues for public education regarding the effects of smoking on young children and for anti-smoking programs. The court agreed with the trial court, finding the Act constitutional. The court held that the Act did not violate the single-subject rule in Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 8(d), because the Act's provisions, including the tax on tobacco products, was reasonably germane to its goal of promoting the healthy development of young children and evidence showed that such development was adversely affected by tobacco usage. The court also found no violation of Cal. Const. XVI, &sect; 3. The court held that the state commission created by the Act was a state agency and that the state and county commissions authorized by the Act were overseen through independent audit and reporting requiring requirements. Also, only elected officials could appoint members of the commissions.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the Immunity Statute continues to shield defendant tobacco companies in product liability actions but only for conduct they engaged in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">during</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the 10-year period when the Immunity Statute was in effect. The liability of tobacco companies based on their conduct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c16">outside</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the 10-year period of immunity is governed by general tort principles.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a products liability suit filed by plaintiff smoker, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit certified a question asking whether Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1714.45, which repealed former Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1714.45 (1988) (repealed 1998), governed a claim that accrued after January 1, 1998, the effective date of the new statute, based on conduct that occurred prior to January 1, 1998.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman began smoking cigarettes in 1956 and continued to smoke heavily until 1997. Throughout this period, and until 1998, she also worked and lived in environments in which those around her smoked cigarettes. In 1998, she was diagnosed with lung cancer allegedly caused by her exposure to tobacco. In 1999, she filed a complaint against tobacco manufacturers, alleging several claims, including strict liability, negligence, breach of implied warranties, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. At issue was the effect of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1714.45, a repealing statute, on former Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1714.45 (1988) (repealed 1998), the statute which provided tort immunity to the manufacturers of inherently dangerous products. On review, the state supreme court determined that the repealing statute had the effect of lifting the immunity for conduct of the tobacco companies outside the 10-year period. Consequently, the tobacco companies were subject to liability under general tort principles for conduct outside the statutory immunity period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Placer County Superior Court, California, which committed him to the California Department of Mental Health for an indeterminate term as a sexually violent predator (SVP). In August 2002, a district attorney had filed a petition to commit defendant as an SVP, but the matter was not tried until April 2007.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In November 2006, the voters approved Proposition 83, which amended the California Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA), Welf. &amp; Inst. Code,  &sect; 6600 et seq. Defendant argued that the SVPA amendments, which provided for indeterminate commitments, should not have been applied to him retroactively and were unconstitutional. The court concluded that the amended SVPA was not applied to defendant retroactively and that defendant's constitutional challenges were without merit. The determination made at the initial commitment hearing in April 2007 was that defendant was an SVP at that time. In light of that fact, the application to defendant of the amended version of the SVPA was not a retroactive application of the law. Defendant's ex post facto argument failed because defendant failed to identify any provision in the amended SVPA that made it so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate the voters' stated intent, which was to strengthen and improve the laws controlling sexual offenders, not to punish them. Defendant's indeterminate commitment did not violate due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court could not say, as a matter of law, that the employment application unambiguously directed applicants not to disclose prohibited marijuana-related convictions, it concluded that the lawsuit suffered from two fundamental flaws, either of which provided ample grounds for writ relief. First, the employer attempted to disclaim an interest in such prohibited information, and two of the applicants understood the employer not to be seeking it. There was no evidence that either of them was confused and believed that he was being asked to disclose marijuana-related convictions that were more than two years old. Second, no applicant in the suit had any marijuana-related convictions to reveal, and thus they were not members of a legally protected group. Nothing in &sect;&sect; 432.7 and 432.8 authorized job applicants to automatically recover $ 200 per person without proof they were aggrieved persons with an injury that the statutes were designed to remedy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the first of two cities, appealed from the dismissal by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) of its action for declaratory relief regarding the validity of an initiative. In a consolidated appeal, intervenor, an initiative's sponsor, appealed the denial of its anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) motion to strike a declaratory judgment cross-complaint filed by defendant, the second city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initiatives sought to prevent city officials from receiving certain advantages from persons or entities who derived benefit from discretionary decisions made by those officials. The court agreed with the trial court that the first city lacked the requisite standing to challenge the constitutionality of the initiative and that the claims were not ripe for determination. The action was not an appropriate statutory validation action because it did not involve a justiciable dispute between parties directly affected by a public entity's proposed action or involve a public official whose refusal to perform a public duty impeded the entity from fulfilling its functions. The trial court erred, however, in denying the sponsor's anti-SLAPP motion. The acts which led the second city to file a cross-complaint against the initiative sponsor arose out of protected First Amendment activities, and the second city was not able to demonstrate the requisite probability of success on the cross-complaint. Finally, the sponsor was entitled to recover attorneys' fees under the private attorney general statute,&nbsp;Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1021.5, based on the necessity of its private enforcement action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order dismissing the first city's action. In the second action, the court reversed the orders denying the anti-SLAPP motion and granting the motion for summary judgment. The court also reversed the order denying the motion of the resident and the sponsor for attorneys' fees and remanded the matter for reconsideration. The court awarded the organization its attorneys' fees and costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect; 3000, subd.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over defendant's objection, the prosecution presented evidence that defendant had committed two previous attacks on older men. On appeal, defendant argued that the admission of the prior acts evidence was in error. Although the admission of such evidence of prior acts of elder abuse was expressly sanctioned by Evid. Code, &sect; 1109, subd. (a)(2), defendant argued that the admission of the evidence violated his right to due process because it permitted the jury to find guilt based on propensity rather than on evidence of the crimes with which he was charged. The court concluded that the admission of the prior acts evidence did not violate defendant's right to due process. The acts testified to by both witnesses were both physical assaults with a sexual tone committed on elderly men. They were very similar to the crimes charged in the case at bar and tended to show a propensity to commit such acts. They were no more inflammatory than the very acts with which defendant was charged. Thus, the trial judge did not err in finding that the evidence was not unduly prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developers sought review of judgments from the Alameda County Superior Court (California), which denied the developers' petitions for writ of mandate and entered judgments on the pleadings against the developers in a challenge to the validity of a local land use planning initiative, known as &quot;Measure D,&quot; enacted by the voters of respondent county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developers contended that Measure D violated the single-subject rule of Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 8(d), violated state land use planning laws, was arbitrary, and caused an unconstitutional regulatory taking. The court found no merit in the developers' arguments, observing that the initiative contained numerous findings pertinent to its stated purpose of protecting areas of open space. Moreover, the existence of statutes and regulations specific to waste management did not preclude an initiative that amended a general plan from addressing the issue of solid waste management. Measure D did not conflict with provisions of the California State Planning and Zoning Law, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65000 et seq. There was no unconstitutional taking, as several permissible uses remained open to the developers' property; also, because the developers had not submitted any applications for development of the property since the adoption of Measure D, administrative remedies were not exhausted. The initiative was not arbitrary. The developers could not claim estoppel, based on initial county approval, because they had not been issued a building permit or functional equivalent thereof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the suit was filed the city amended Beverly Hills, Cal.

The trial court ruled that the ordinance was changed and not clarified, but that the change was retroactive. The appellate court found that: (1) the ordinance was substantively changed, not just clarified; (2) there was no basis in the plain language of the ordinance or its legislative history to apply the change retroactively; and (3) there was a private right of action under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 36900(a) to redress violations of city ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landowner brought a quiet title action against the railroad. The bone of contention was the interpretation of a 1901 transaction in which the landowner's predecessors granted an interest in land to the railroad. The landowner alleged the conveyance transferred only an easement that had been terminated. The trial court agreed and entered judgment for the landowner. The appellate court disagreed. There was no ambiguity in the deed; it conveyed a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. The realty could return to the grantors or their assigns if the railroad ceased for six months to use the property. Given it was undisputed that said condition occurred, the landowner had a right to reclaim the land. However, the Marketable Record Title Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 880.020 et seq., required the landowner or his predecessor(s) in interest to record in a timely way an intent to preserve the future interest. The failure to comply with that statutory requirement barred the landowner's action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner physician filed an original proceeding for a writ of mandate directing the real party in interest, the Medical Board of California, to set aside its decision revoking his license to practice medicine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Medical Board of California filed an accusation against a physician, alleging violations of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 2239. Section 2239 provided that, if a physician sustained two or more misdemeanor convictions involving the consumption of alcoholic beverages, those convictions constituted unprofessional conduct. The physician pleaded nolo contendere, and his licenses were suspended. Thereafter, he filed a petition for a writ, asserting that the evidence did not support the Medical Board's finding. He also claimed that &sect; 2239 was unconstitutional, as applied. The appellate court rejected his claims. A logical connection existed between the convictions and the physician's fitness to practice medicine, and therefore imposing discipline on his physician's license, pursuant to &sect; 2239(a), did not violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the California and United States Constitutions. The record of the convictions involving alcohol consumption provided conclusive evidence of his unprofessional conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of auto theft in 1994 and placed on probation. In 1996, police officers conducted a probation search of defendant's residence. Prior to the search, the police obtained information that defendant was on probation with a search condition. The police did not inquire as to whether there were any special conditions about his search. The police testified that they searched the residence primarily for narcotics and found drug paraphernalia and a small amount of methamphetamine in defendant's bedroom. The probation roster did not reflect that the scope of defendant's consent was limited to searches for stolen property. Defendant alleged that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated and that the items seized should be suppressed. The trial court denied the motion. The appellate court reversed and rejected the State's argument that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule should apply. The appellate court held that the unlimited search was not &quot;objectively reasonable,&quot; as the police should have known that search consents could be limited and that the law prohibited exceeding the limitation.</SPAN></P>
