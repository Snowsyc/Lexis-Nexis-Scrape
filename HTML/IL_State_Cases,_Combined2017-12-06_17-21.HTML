<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501.1 (2000), appellant motorist's license was summarily suspended for three years as a third-time driving under the influence (DUI) offender. He petitioned to rescind the suspension. The Circuit Court of Wabash County, Illinois, found that he had failed to establish a prima facie case and dismissed his petition. The motorist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist claimed he did not refuse to submit to chemical testing because he agreed to a breath test and was physically and medically unable to submit to a blood test. The officer denied asking the motorist to take a breath test. The appellate court held that the trial court, in ruling on appellee State's 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1110 (2002) motion, was not required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the motorist, but properly judged the credibility of the motorist's evidence in finding that he failed to make a prima facie case under 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-118.1 (2002). The motorist failed to put on medical or other corroborating testimony regarding his fear of having blood drawn, or that it was physically or psychologically impossible for him to take a blood test. The officer was not required to articulate a need for a blood test before requesting one; moreover, as he found cannabis in the motorist's van, and blood test results were necessary to establish if a driver was under the influence of drugs, his decision was reasonable. 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501.1(c) and (d) (2000) were not unconstitutionally vague and did not deprive the motorist of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff village and found that Division 15.1, (65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-15.1-1 through 11-15.1-5 (2002)) of the Municipal Code, 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-1-1 through 11-152-4 (2002), granted the village zoning and building-code jurisdiction over lands subject to annexation agreements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village filed a complaint against the county for declaratory judgment that it had zoning and building-code jurisdiction over certain lands that were subject to annexation agreements. The county filed a counterclaim for declaratory judgment that it, not the village, had legal jurisdiction over the lands for zoning and building code purposes. The court affirmed the trial court. Resolution of the case required the interpretation of 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-13-1, 11-15.1-2 (2002) and 55 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-1063 (2002). While the language of the three statutes was clear and unambiguous, the statutes were in direct conflict with one another. The court had previously held that an annexing municipality's subdivision and zoning jurisdiction overrode another municipality's statutory grant of planning jurisdiction. The same held true for the county's statutory zoning grant. Thus, the trial court properly ruled that Division 15.1 controlled the issue presented to it. On its affirmative defenses, the county failed to prove that the classification system in 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-15.1-2.1 (2002) was arbitrary or that it was an invalid use of legislative police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment, which granted summary judgment in favor of the village, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicting him of unlawful use of a weapon (UUW) by a felon in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6(a)(1)(3)(A) (2002). He challenged the constitutionality of the statute and the sufficiency of the evidence. He also argued that he had not received all the admonishments required by Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 605(a) and that there was an error in the mittimus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police investigating young people with apparent gang affiliations loitering at night in a city park pursued defendant as he fled on a bicycle. Each saw him remove an object from his waistband and fling it away. One officer never took his eyes off the object, which proved to be a gun. The appellate court upheld his UUW conviction, first finding that since the UUW statute rationally related to the legitimate government aim of preventing violence and, moreover, required scienter of knowledge, it did not violate substantive due process. Furthermore, the evidence of the two officers was ample to support conviction, despite slight discrepancies that naturally occurred when each saw the action from a different perspective. Defendant had stipulated to a previous felony conviction, so he could not complain of the State's failure to prove it. Although the trial court gave most of the required admonishments at sentencing, there was an apparently inadvertent omission of an admonishment regarding the right to move for reconsideration of sentence. That error was harmless, since defendant had not shown any resulting prejudice. Finally, a wording error in the mittimus was corrected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court corrected the slight error in the mittimus, which the State had conceded, and affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant former employer of a child support obligor appealed from a Douglas County Circuit Court (Illinois) judgment that imposed an enormous penalty on him, payable to plaintiff obligee, for allegedly knowingly failing to pay withheld child support within seven days, as required by 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 28/35 (2000). He argued that the trial court misinterpreted the statute and, in the alternative, that it was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer, who did not handle payroll, knew little about when the support checks were paid; his son was the only witness regarding the manner in which the son, as bookkeeper, handled the checks. His practice was to mail everything out, pay and child support, the Saturday of the week after the pay period had ended. The appellate court held, first, that under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 28/15(b-5) (2002), the seven-day period did not run on Saturdays, so the mailings were timely, if otherwise proper. In a country town with no mailboxes, mailing occurred when the son followed his customary practice of putting the stamped letters out for the carrier to pick up that day. 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 28/35 made it clear that the employer was to be regarded as having made payment when mailing occurred, and so the trial court's finding that payment was made only upon arrival and date-stamping at the collection unit was manifestly erroneous, given that the son's evidence was uncontradicted. Although the employer's records of payment showed a few other irregularities, they could be attributed to oversight, and the finding that they were knowing was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

He was kept &quot;past call&quot; while the police investigation continued. On appeal, defendant asserted three errors, including error in the failure to suppress his court-reported statement. The court reversed, holding that (1) the statement should have been suppressed because it was tainted by the failure to take defendant promptly before a judge for a 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/109-1(a) (1998) hearing and by the failure of the police to cease questioning defendant after he exercised his right to remain silent; (2) the trial court properly refused to give an involuntary manslaughter instruction; and (3) the prosecutor's repeated references to defendant as &quot;pure evil&quot; were improper and denied defendant a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder under a theory of accountability. He was sentenced to a mandatory life sentence under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) (1998) because he had been convicted of the murders of more than one person. Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the appellate court's order remanding the case for resentencing implied that the sentence was discretionary. The appellate court's mandate unambiguously stated that defendant was to be resentenced under the prior version of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii). As defendant conceded, that version clearly required a mandatory life sentence for the murders of more than one person. Thus, defendant's natural life sentence was mandatory. Defendant alternatively argued that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) was unconstitutional as applied to him under the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in People v. Miller. However, the appellate court concluded that People v. Miller did not apply to defendant, a &quot;young&quot; adult, regardless of his allegedly passive participation in the murders because defendant was an adult at the time the murders were committed, making his life sentence mandatory and the degree of his participation in the murders irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant left a message on the victim's answering machine, which included a few vulgarities. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to allow the trial court to find that she had the requisite intent to harass. The appellate court concluded that a trier of fact could not infer an intent to harass in the required sense solely from the use of some vulgar language in a telephone call that otherwise had a legitimate purpose. For a call to be made with intent to harass, the caller had to have had the intent to produce emotional distress akin to that of a threat. Thus, the appellate court concluded that the evidence did not support the inference that defendant intended her call to harass the victim. Defendant might have intended her language to offend, as her admission that leaving the message was wrong suggested, but intent to offend was not sufficient to sustain her conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/19-1(a) (2000) and theft in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/16-1(a)(1)(A) (2000). He was sentenced to concurrent terms of six and a half years' imprisonment, and was ordered to give a blood sample for genetic marker testing, pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2002). Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to suppress evidence and that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 was unconstitutional. The appellate court concluded that because the police lacked probable cause when they arrested defendant, the trial court should have suppressed any harmful statements made by him subsequent to his arrest. However, the trial court's admission of defendant's statements--his request for his wallet and his admission that he was in the area where a theft of computer equipment occurred--was harmless because there was sufficient and competent evidence presented at the trial that clearly established defendant's guilt. The statements were not material to the guilty finding where other competent evidence overwhelmingly established defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, the appellate court found that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 was not unconstitutional. The State's interest in deterring and prosecuting recidivist criminal acts strongly outweighed defendant's diminished right to privacy and the minimal intrusion caused by the submission of a blood, saliva, or tissue sample.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of first-degree murder. The trial court sentenced defendant to 45 years' imprisonment, 25 years for murder with a mandatory 20-year add-on because the court found that defendant personally discharged a firearm during the commission of the murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after an informant identified him. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the warrantless arrest and suppress evidence because the police lacked probable cause for his arrest. Further, he asserted that the statute which mandated the addition of 20 years to his 25-year sentence for murder, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(ii) (2000), was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that probable cause to arrest defendant existed, as the information provided by the informant had an indicia of reliability because it independently corroborated information the police learned through their investigation. Further, the enhanced penalty provision for personally discharging a firearm as applied to first-degree murder did not violate the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution. Finally, the enhanced penalty provision, as applied to first-degree murder, did not violate due process as the increase in penalty was a reasonable means of deterring the targeted conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a car stopped after a brief pursuit for a traffic violation. Defendant, who was seated in the car, was ordered to raise his hands. A police officer testified that as defendant raised his hands, the officer saw a gun in defendant's right hand. When defendant's hands were at chest level, he dropped the gun to the floor of the car. The loaded gun was recovered after defendant was ordered to exit the car. On appeal, defendant argued that the officer's testimony was incredible and was insufficient to support defendant's conviction. He also argued that the UUW statute violated due process and that the penalty for UUW violated the Illinois proportionate penalties clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970). The court affirmed, holding that (1) the officer's testimony supported defendant's conviction and the trial court's finding of credibility would not be reversed; (2) the aggravated UUW statute was rationally related to the goal of protecting public safety; and (3) comparative proportionality review of the UUW statute and Illinois' reckless discharge of a firearm statute was inappropriate because the statutes were enacted for different legislative purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, McHenry County (Illinois), entered a series of orders that declared respondent mother to be an unfit parent and determined that it was in the best interests of her child that her parental rights be terminated. The unfitness finding was based solely on the Adoption Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(q) (2002), which allowed for that finding due to her prior conviction for aggravated battery of a child. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was in an alcohol-induced blackout when she fractured the arm of a daughter. Thereafter, the mother pled guilty to a charge of aggravated battery. She then successfully completed an inpatient substance-abuse program. In the meantime, another daughter was born to the mother. The State soon petitioned for termination of parental rights. The sole allegation regarding unfitness was that the mother previously had been convicted of aggravated battery to a child. The Adoption Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(q) (2002), permitted a finding of unfitness due to such a conviction alone. The trial court held a hearing and, thereafter, terminated the mother's parental rights in the younger daughter. On appeal, the appellate court found that &sect; 50/1(D)(q) was unconstitutional, as it violated the mother's substantive due process rights because it mandated a finding of unfitness based on the conviction alone, without regard to consideration of other relevant factors. The appellate court added that while the State had a compelling interest in the welfare of children, the statute was not narrowly tailored to advance that interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held the statutory section unconstitutional. Accordingly, it reversed the finding of unfitness and vacated the trial court's order terminating the mother's parental rights. It also remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted him of armed robbery and sentenced him to natural life imprisonment as a habitual criminal pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33B-1 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that his sentence was unconstitutional because the penalties for armed robbery and armed violence with a weapon were disproportionate, and the sentence was disproportionate to the sentences imposed on his codefendants. He also argued that the trial court failed to conduct an adequate inquiry into his posttrial pro se claims of ineffective assistance. The appellate court found that defendant's natural life sentence was constitutionally proportionate where defendant had no constitutional right to choose the offense with which he would be charged or his penalty--he was charged with the greater offense of armed robbery and not the lesser offense of armed violence. In addition, defendant's penalty was not based solely on the armed robbery offense, but also on his history of committing violent Class X offenses. Where defendant's background supported application of the Habitual Criminal Act and there was nothing to indicate that either codefendant had a similar criminal background, defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally disproportionate. Finally, the trial court adequately inquired into defendant's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence of natural life imprisonment were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Hall, Judge Presiding.  <BR>Mermelstein v. Rothner, 324 Ill. App. 3d 1126, 805 N.E.2d 750, 2001 Ill. App. LEXIS 4740, 282 Ill. Dec. 131 (Ill. App. Ct., 2001)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of defendant corporation in a breach of fiduciary duty action, the corporation dismissed its counterclaim against plaintiff. When that judgment was reversed and remanded, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, and the corporation raised its previously dismissed counterclaim. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the counterclaim as time barred. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-207 appeared to preserve a defendant's right to bring an otherwise time-barred counterclaim, while 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-217 appeared to limit that right after one year if the counterclaim was voluntarily dismissed. Focusing on the waiver theory of 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-207 allowed the court to harmonize the apparent conflict with 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-217. If a defendant had previously voluntarily dismissed a claim that would otherwise be barred by the statute of limitation or the one-year period of 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-217, that claim would (as the result of waiver) nevertheless be &quot;within the remaining period of limitation.&quot; Therefore, the court found defendant's counterclaim was not barred by the one-year limitation of 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-217 because, as a result of plaintiff's waiver, it was not outside the period of limitation. Moreover, the court found judicial economy was not served by adopting a statutory interpretation forcing defendants to litigate counterclaims, when they would prefer not to, simply to preserve these claims against the possibility of an appeal favorable to the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), granted appellee landlord's summary judgment motion on that count of appellant contractor's complaint against the landlord that sought to have the landlord pay a lien amount for renovation work the contractor performed for defendant tenant in the building owned by the landlord. It then denied the contractor's motion for leave to file a proposed amended complaint. The contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant moved into the landlord's building. Thereafter, the tenant and the contractor executed an agreement obligating the contractor to perform office renovation work and obligating the tenant to make biweekly progress payments. The tenant paid for most, but not all, of the total cost of the project. The contractor then filed a claim for lien and a two-count complaint. The second count, directed at the landlord, sought recovery of the lien amount. Eventually, the contractor released its lien against the landlord and sought leave to file an amended pleading alleging quantum meruit and unjust enrichment claims. The landlord responded by stating it had no direct relationship with the contractor and had not been a party to the renovation contract. The trial court denied the motion for leave to amend and granted the landlord's summary judgment motion. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court did not err in denying the motion for leave, as the contractor had not pled any facts showing that the landlord had engaged in conduct that merited quasi-contract relief against the landlord and in the contractor's favor for the tenant's renovation contract debt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied a petition for administrative review of a decision of respondent Cook County Sheriffs Merit Board to discharge petitioner employee after it found that she was in violation of the sheriff's office drug-free workplace policy. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff's office had a drug-free workplace policy, which the parties agreed was a zero-tolerance policy. The employee, a deputy sheriff, was randomly selected to undergo drug testing. After the employee's urine sample tested positive for the presence of cocaine metabolites, the sheriff's office filed a complaint with the Merit Board. At a hearing, the employee testified and presented evidence that she tested positive for the presence of cocaine metabolites due to her innocent consumption of Mate de Coca tea that was purchased in Peru when she and her husband traveled there to adopt a child. After the hearing, the Merit Board discharged the employee, and the circuit court denied her petition for review. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the application of the drug-free workplace policy by the Merit Board was not rationally related to the specified purpose of the policy and, therefore, violated the employee's substantive due process rights. The court stated that a review of the extensive factual findings led it to conclude that the Merit Board found that the employee tested positive for the presence of cocaine metabolites due to her innocent consumption of the tea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the Merit Board to dismiss the employee for cause and reversed the order of the circuit court affirming the Merit Board's decision. The court remanded the cause to the circuit court with instructions to enter an order reinstating the employee in her position as an employee of the sheriff's office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The detainee was arrested on aggravated battery charges and was found unfit to stand trial. The use of psychotropic drugs rendered the detainee fit to stand trial but he discontinued the drugs after being released from a detention health center. As a result, he again became unfit to stand trial, leading to a 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-107.1 (2002) for involuntary treatment. The detainee filed a motion to dismiss, contending that &sect; 2-107.1 was unconstitutional. The motion was denied and the order allowing the State to administer the psychotropic drugs was entered. The court affirmed in part, holding that &sect; 2-107.1 was not unconstitutional and that the State could administer antipsychotic drugs to the detainee to render him competent to stand trial. However, the drugs could only be administered based on a showing that important governmental interests existed that would be furthered by administration of the drugs, that the involuntary medication was necessary to further those state interests, and that the administration of the drugs was medically appropriate. The parties' trial court stipulation allowing the involuntary administration of the drugs fell short of those requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois), which, following a jury trial, convicted defendant on two counts of home invasion and one count of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. Defendant was acquitted on two counts of armed robbery. Defendant's 21-year sentence included a 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-11(c) (2000) 15-year sentence enhancement for possession of a firearm during a home invasion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was admitted into a dwelling where he threatened the occupants with a gun. Shortly after entering the dwelling, defendant opened the door and allowed two accomplices into the home. On appeal, defendant contended that he was not proven guilty of home invasion, that the &sect; 12-11(c) sentence enhancement violated Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 (1970), and that his conviction on two counts of home invasion violated the one-act, one-crime rule. The court agreed in part. While home invasion usually required entry of a dwelling &quot;without authority,&quot; the evidence showed that defendant intended to rob the occupants of the dwelling when he was allowed to enter and thus, the limited-authority doctrine supported his home invasion convictions. Home invasion and aggravated battery with a firearm were similar crimes, with home invasion being the less serious crime. As such, the sentence enhancement for home invasion was a harsher penalty than the penalty for aggravated battery with a firearm and it violated the proportionate penalties clause. Finally, although there were multiple victims, defendant committed only one act of home invasion and his multiple convictions were improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed one of defendant's convictions for home invasion, but the second conviction was vacated. The court also vacated defendant's sentence and remanded the case so that a new sentencing hearing could be held.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress evidence was denied. Defendant stipulated to a bench trial, and was convicted of criminal drug conspiracy and unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance. The Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to concurrent prison terms of 19 years for each conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the search of his home was unconstitutional because his parole agreement did not give the parole agent the authority to search his home without a warrant. The appellate court disagreed, noting that defendant signed a parole agreement permitting the agent to visit his home and that the need to remove persons from the home and to locate, dismantle, and take possession of the dangerous instrumentalities used in cooking the methamphetamine was an exigent circumstance that justified the warrantless search. Next, contrary to defendant's argument, the trial court's admonishments pursuant to the guilty plea procedure did not transform defendant's stipulated bench trial into a guilty plea. As for defendant's sufficiency claim, the appellate court concluded that the liquid mixture, containing the ingredients necessary to manufacture methamphetamine, constituted a substance containing methamphetamine despite the fact that it was not yet in marketable form. Finally, the appellate court vacated defendant's conspiracy conviction and sentence based on 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8-5 (2002), prohibiting the conviction of both the inchoate offense and the principal offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence for criminal drug conspiracy were vacated. The case was remanded to the circuit court with directions to credit $ 1,875 against the defendant's drug assessment. In all other respects, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-14(a), criminalizing prostitution, prohibited conduct constitutionally protected under U.S. Const., amend XIV. The appellate court held the statute did not affect a fundamental right or suspect classification, so it was reviewed under the rational basis test. Under that test, it was a valid attempt to promote the legitimate purpose of protecting the safety, health, and welfare of the people by preventing venereal disease, cutting down prostitution-related crimes of violence and theft, and protecting the integrity and stability of family life. As the statute validly attempted to protect the public welfare, it did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. Acts of prostitution were excluded from the protection afforded private sexual activity between two consenting adults. The statute was carefully crafted to distinguish between the business of selling sex and private, noncommercial, acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a widow and her son, filed an action against defendants, a law firm and an attorney who worked for the law firm, alleging malpractice. The Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) granted the attorney and law firm's motion, pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-619(a)(5) (2002), to dismiss the complaint, and denied the widow and son's motion for reconsideration. The widow and son appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A widow and her son by a previous marriage sued an attorney and a law firm in January 1998, alleging that they were prevented from receiving money which the widow's deceased husband intended to transfer under a trust, will, and codicil he executed because the attorney improperly drafted the husband's will. The attorney and law firm filed a motion to dismiss the action, arguing that it was time-barred under &sect; 13-214.3(d) of the Illinois Limitations Act, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-214.3(d) (1994). The trial court agreed, and it dismissed the case. The appellate court (1) noted that &sect; 13-214.3(d) was repealed by 1995 Ill. Laws 89-7 (Public Act 89-7), but was reinstated in December 1997 when the Supreme Court of Illinois declared that Public Act 89-7 was unconstitutional; (2) noted that the widow and son's action would not have been time-barred if Public Act 89-7 had not been declared unconstitutional; and (3) held that the widow and son had a reasonable period of time after the supreme court declared Public Act 89-7 to be unconstitutional to file their lawsuit, that they filed their lawsuit within a reasonable period of time, and that their lawsuit was not time-barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer responded to a report of two people sleeping in a car with the motor running. The officer observed defendant in the passenger seat, woke up the driver, and then opened the door of the car. In the armrest of the opened door, the officer observed cocaine. The officer woke up defendant, who was holding an unloaded .25-caliber revolver. Defendant was arrested. Later defendant, in a statement, admitted to owning the gun and drugs. Defense counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence. By pursuing a motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence, defense counsel could have made a strong case that the circumstances surrounding defendant's arrest failed to demonstrate probable cause. The officer's seizure of defendant arguably amounted to an unconstitutional seizure. The officer woke up the driver prior to opening the door. The record reflected no further need to gain the driver's attention or to open the door. Defendant was prejudiced by counsel's failure to file the motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence. Had the motion succeeded, the evidence needed for the prosecution would have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which convicted defendant on charges of unlawful observation of voting under 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/29-9 (2000) and on charges of absentee ballot violations under 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/29-20(4) (2000) in connection with the completion and mailing of the absentee ballots of two voters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went to the voters' homes and obtained their signatures on absentee ballot request forms. Once the ballots were mailed to the voters, defendant returned to the homes. With voter one, defendant sat on the couch with the voter and instructed which numbers to punch on the ballot. With voter two, defendant provided a list a numbers and stood nearby as voter two completed the ballots. Defendant then looked at the ballot and had voter two re-punch a number that had not punched cleanly. Defendant then put the ballots in the mail for the voters. On appeal, she argued insufficient evidence to sustain her convictions. The court affirmed, holding that (1) the circumstantial evidence surrounding defendant's presence as the voters completed their ballots supported the unlawful observation convictions; (2) the fact that defendant knowingly took the voters ballots and mailed them, a violation of 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/19-6 (2000) supported her conviction under 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/29-20(4) (2000), and (3) the fact that the statutes defendant was convicted under required only a knowing mental state rather than criminal intent did not violate substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother challenged a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which, in two companion orders, found her to be an unfit parent and terminated her parental rights to two of her minor children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother contended that the trial court erred in several respects when it found her unfit as a parent.

Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/2-1 (2002) over the case when the children were temporarily returned to the mother, and, thus, a second neglect hearing was not required; (2) the mother's contentions regarding 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(m)(i), (ii) were moot; (3) &sect; 1(D)(m)(iii) did not connote any particular burden of proof, let alone one that &quot;lessened&quot; the established burden of clear and convincing evidence under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/8, and thus, it did not violate due process; (4) the limited steps respondent took toward reunification were insufficient and came too late, and the trial court's finding of unfitness under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(m)(iii) was not against the manifest weight of the evidence; and (5) the termination of the mother's parental rights was in the best interest of the children under 705 Ill.

The appellate court affirmed. Thereafter, the trial court granted the State's motion to have his case be designated as an extended jurisdiction juvenile proceeding and entered a final disposition after he was adjudicated by a jury to be delinquent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A car full of people, including defendant, passed near three people. Defendant then got out, ran up to them, and fatally shot one. Witnesses identified defendant as the shooter. He was arrested. His mother went with him to the police station. Defendant was read his Miranda rights. He asked &quot;Do I need a lawyer?&quot; but nevertheless gave statements admitting he shot the victim. The trial court denied his motions to quash and suppress. It also denied the State's motion to transfer the case to adult court, which was affirmed on appeal. It granted the State's motion to designate the case as an extended jurisdiction juvenile (EJJ) matter. Defendant was adjudicated delinquent. He was given a juvenile sentence and a conditional adult sentence. On appeal, the appellate court found that the delinquency finding was proper because probable cause existed to arrest him, his confessions were voluntarily given, and he did not invoke the right to counsel. However, it also found that only the juvenile portion of his sentence was proper because the State was required to simultaneously file its motion to transfer and motion to designate the case as an EJJ matter and did not do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disposition was affirmed, and the sentence was modified by deleting the adult portion of defendant's sentence and retaining the juvenile portion of his sentence, which meant his sentence of incarceration would continue until his 21st birthday.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a street gang member. He held the rank of &quot;chief enforcer.&quot; He saw the victim and mistakenly believed that the victim was a rival gang member. Defendant, accompanied by two fellow gang members, fired several shots at the victim. One bullet struck the victim and killed him. During jury selection, defendant attempted to use a peremptory challenge to strike an African-American woman after learning she worked at a hospital known for its treatment of gunshot victims. The prospective juror clarified that she worked at an out-patient clinic associated with the hospital. The trial court prevented defendant from striking her because it thought his explanation for doing so was not race-neutral. The juror was then seated. After a trial, defendant was convicted and sentenced to 85 years in prison. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court could sua sponte intervene to prevent the juror's rights from being violated and to guard the judicial system's integrity, defendant's trial-court enhanced sentence violated Apprendi but the error was harmless, and the imposition of an extended term sentence did not violate state constitutional rights to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 14th Judicial Circuit Court, Rock Island County (Illinois), entered a judgment that affirmed appellee city police pension board's decision that denied appellant former police officer's requests that he be allowed to receive a line-of-duty disability pension or a non-duty disability pension. The former police officer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former police officer, while working as a police officer, submitted to a psychological examination to determine his fitness for a promotion. He received it after a doctor determined that he was of sound mind and suffered no impediments that would hinder his performance. However, as time passed, things began to change. The former police officer's job performance allegedly declined after he was reprimanded by the police chief. Also, he appeared to become traumatized by several incidents at work, including injuries he sustained, the stress of trying to save a trapped motorist, and his knowledge of several suicides. He started seeing two treating physicians and took their advice to leave police work to do something else. He applied for a line-of-duty disability pension or a non-duty disability pension. The city police pension board denied both requests and the trial court affirmed. On appeal, the appellate court found a city police pension board member with an apparent conflict-of-interest was properly allowed to remain on the board to decided his case, but further proceedings were required because specified error occurred in weighing the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision permitting the city police pension board's member to remain on the board to decide whether the former police officer was entitled to a disability pension despite an alleged conflict-of-interest was affirmed; however, the board's finding that the former police officer failed to prove he had a disability preventing him from performing police work was reversed, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, three trustees and two beneficiaries of a trust, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which dismissed plaintiffs' second amended complaint against defendants, an attorney and law firm one and an attorney and law firm two, pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-619(a)(5) (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs asserted that as a result of legal malpractice, the beneficiaries of the trust, who were disabled, lost certain public assistance benefits when the trust went into operation. Proper drafting of the trust could have avoided the loss. The trial court dismissed based on a finding that the action was barred by the six-year statute of repose in 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-214.3 (2002). Plaintiffs asserted that the statute was tolled because attorney one fraudulently concealed plaintiffs' cause of action. The trial court disagreed, finding that none of the claims against that attorney were for fraudulent concealment. The court reversed. The issue was whether the allegations in the complaint established a fraudulent concealment sufficient to overcome the statute of repose. Allegations that the attorney falsely assured the maker of the trust that he would provide the maker with a copy, and then did not, were sufficient to overcome the statute. Plaintiffs also asserted that their action was in fact timely under &sect; 13-214.3(d). The burden was on defendants to show that the time in &sect; 13-214.3(d) had expired. Defendants failed to do so, making dismissal under that section error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a corporation and its chief executive officer (CEO), appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that denied their motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent defendant law firm from representing its opponent in an arbitration, claiming the attorney in question had once represented the corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had found that the corporation and CEO had failed to make any showing that the attorney or the firm had represented them in any way that would have affected the pending arbitration regarding an asset sale. The arbitration went forward, but the corporation and CEO appealed denial of the injunction. The appellate court held that while Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 307 authorized interlocutory appeals from rulings on requests for injunctive relief in certain situations, case law applying that rule held it inapplicable to orders relating to disqualification of counsel. While an appeal might have been allowed under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 306, the corporation and CEO had failed to raise appropriate grounds for such a permissive appeal. Finally, appellate jurisdiction was absent because of mootness. The arbitration had gone forward and the challenged attorney had represented the opponent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), dismissed plaintiff taxpayer's action seeking a declaratory judgment that a statute allowing a licensee who was not conducting riverboat gambling before a specified date to apply to defendant state gaming board for license renewal and approval of relocation to a new home dock location. The taxpayer had contended the statute was unconstitutional special legislation. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state gaming board issued a riverboat gambling license to the licensee's corporate predecessor. Although it operated a riverboat in its designated location there for several years, it ceased operations when it found the location was not economically viable. The state legislature then revised its riverboat gambling law, under which it had granted 10 riverboat gambling licenses, to allow the licensee to apply to the state gaming board for a license renewal and approval of relocation to a new location. The licensee applied pursuant to that law. The taxpayer then filed suit and claimed that the revised law was unconstitutional because it was special legislation passed to benefit only the licensee. The trial court dismissed the taxpayer's lawsuit. On appeal, the appellate court first found that the taxpayer had standing. It then found that the revision did not amount to special legislation, even though only one party benefitted from it, because it was rationally related to the State's interest under the riverboat gambling law of producing revenue for the State and promoting its tourism by allowing the licensee to relocate its riverboat casino to a more economically viable area.</SPAN></P>

Defendant allegedly told the detective that he had spent the night at his girlfriend's house. At trial, defendant denied telling the detective that he had been at his girlfriend's house. The trial court found defendant guilty of first-degree murder. It then imposed upon him a base sentence of 30 years and an extended sentence of 20 years for using a firearm to commit the crime. On appeal, the appellate court found that the State disproved defendant's self-defense claim and that the sentencing statute was neither unconstitutional nor violated his due process rights. However, it found the trial court's assumption that the shooting was gang-related required resentencing since the evidence did not support that conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During check-in for a flight, defendant told a ticket agent that he had a bomb in his shoe. The ticket agent detected alcohol on defendant's breath, and told defendant not to make such statements. After defendant made further statements and laughed at the agents, another agent called the police. The police searched defendant and found no explosives. On appeal, defendant contended that the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/26-1(a)(3) distinguished between comments which actually alarmed an individual and those which were understood as joking remarks. The appellate court held that an individual could be found guilty of felony disorderly conduct upon transmission of a false alarm, regardless of the intention of the speaker or the effect the words had upon the person receiving them. The appellate court therefore found that the evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, supported defendant's conviction. The appellate court also denied defendant's claim that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/26-1 was constitutionally overbroad and violated defendant's right to free speech under the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty following a stipulated bench trial in the Circuit Court for the 10th Judicial Circuit, Peoria County, Illinois, on a charge of indecent solicitation of a child, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-6(a). Defendant appealed his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was over 17 years of age, solicited sex from a 15-year old boy he met in a chat room. In reality, the &quot;boy&quot; was a police detective. Defendant was arrested when he traveled to a prearranged location to engage in oral sex with the boy. Section 11-6(a) made it unlawful for someone over the age of 17 to solicit a child, or someone believed to be a child, for the purpose of engaging in sexual conduct. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute based on overbreadth and vagueness, although he did not complain that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court affirmed, holding that (1) any arguably impermissible applications of the &sect; 11-6(a) were dwarfed by the statute's legitimate reach, so the statute was not overbroad and did not impinge on First Amendment rights; (2) defendant could not challenge the statute for vagueness because his actions fell squarely with the statutory proscription of &sect; 11-6(a); and (3) as the statute did not impinge on First Amendment rights, defendant lacked standing to challenge its constitutionality because he was not directly affected by the unconstitutional aspects of the statute he asserted.</SPAN></P>

He was adjudged a habitual criminal and was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences, one for each conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered the home of a husband and wife under the ruse of selling newspapers. He sexually assaulted the wife through both oral and vaginal sex, and he attempted to kill the husband. One count of home invasion was charged relating to the husband and one was charged relating to the wife. The multiple life sentences were based on an interpretation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33B-1(c) (2002). The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part, holding that (1) for purposes of &sect; 33B-1(c), defendant could only be sentenced to one life sentence where his multiple convictions arose out of the same transaction; (2) as defendant was sentenced once under the habitual offender statute, the consecutive sentencing guidelines under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-4(a) (2002) did not apply; (3) the life sentences were vacated and reduced to one life sentence pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615(b); (4) as defendant only &quot;invaded&quot; one home, only one home invasion conviction could stand; and (5) defendant's two convictions for the same act of penile penetration violated the one-act, one-crime rule and one of the convictions was vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment imposing seven consecutive life sentences and sentenced defendant to one term of life imprisonment. The court vacated one of the home invasion convictions, and two of the sentences and convictions on two of the aggravated criminal sexual assault charges. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a wrongful death action, defendant doctors appealed, pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 308, a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which, pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 183, granted two motions filed by plaintiff, administrator of her decedent husband's estate, to extend the six-month statutory period of 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-402 (1998) for converting the doctors from respondents in discovery to defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator filed a wrongful death action against defendant hospital and named the doctors as respondents in discovery. Reversing, the court held that the trial court could not extend the six-month period under &sect; 2-402 because an action filed pursuant to the provisions of &sect; 2-402 was a special statutory action that provided for broad discovery unknown to the common law and made the six-month time requirement an inherent element of the right. Moreover, Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 183's plain language indicated that it only applied to the time limits set forth by the Illinois supreme court rules, and it simply did not apply to a statutory time limit like 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-402; thus, the trial court erred in granting the two extensions. However, after granting the administrator's petition for rehearing and allowing a lawyers association to file an amicus curiae petition in support of the rehearing, the court held that its decision should only apply to the present case and prospectively because it was an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed and the purpose of the court's decision would be promoted by prospective application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and vacated the extension orders and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicted defendant police officer of solicitation of a sex act in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-14.1(a) (2002) and sentenced him to six months' supervision. The trial court denied defendant's motion for a new trial and motion in arrest of judgment. Defendant appealed the denial of his posttrial motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that his conviction should be reversed because 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-14.1(a) was overbroad, vague, and unconstitutional. The appellate court concluded that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-14.1(a) was neither overbroad nor vague as applied and was not unconstitutional. When defendant offered the undercover police officer $ 50 in exchange for sex, he was not engaged in a protected activity because he exercised his right to free speech in the commission of a criminal offense. Also, the statute was not vague as applied to defendant's conduct because it provided adequate and clearly understandable notice that the offer of money in exchange for sex was proscribed. In addition, defendant's offer for sex was proven beyond a reasonable doubt where the undercover officer testified that defendant asked her for &quot;sex,&quot; requested her price for sex, agreed thereto, showed her the money, and moved his car to the location she suggested. Finally, a fatal variance did not exist between the charge that defendant solicited sexual intercourse, an act of sexual penetration, and the proof at trial where the commonly understood meaning of &quot;sex&quot; was sexual intercourse.</SPAN></P>

The one officer asked the driver, the woman, if she was in any danger; she said she was not. The other officer then removed the passenger, defendant, from the vehicle, patted him down, and ran a warrant check on him. The pat down revealed he was carrying a gun and a gun clip, while the warrant check indicated that he had an outstanding DUI warrant. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence that was found. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant was then found guilty of two counts of aggravated unlawful use of weapon. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court erred in denying the suppression motion, as once the police ascertained the woman was not in any danger, the officer's actions in removing defendant from the vehicle, patting him down, and checking for warrants were unreasonable and violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Jefferson County (Illinois), entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of aggravated criminal sexual assault. The trial court then found that, pursuant to statutory law, it was required to sentence defendant to a term of natural-life imprisonment because the conviction was defendant's second conviction for aggravated criminal sexual assault and it imposed that sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the complaining witness went to defendant's trailer. While there, defendant hit her in the head with a hammer. Defendant then placed her on the bed, tied her hands and feet, raped her, and then drove her home. Prior to trial, the State filed a motion in limine to prevent defendant from introducing evidence that she had, on a prior occasion, falsely accused a person of an offense. The trial court granted the motion. At the trial, a special assistant State's Attorney helped the prosecuting attorney. The trial court overruled defendant's objection to the assistance. Defendant was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault. Pursuant to a statute, he received a mandatory term of natural life imprisonment because it was his second conviction for that offense. On appeal, the appellate court found that defendant was not entitled to impeach the witness with a collateral example of untruthfulness, defendant's argument that the special assistant was not authorized to appear was waived since he objected on another ground, and the statute requiring a mandatory natural life term did not create a disproportionate penalty and, thus, did not violate the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The worker was able to take a company phone that defendant had put in his pocket. The fight continued outside, defendant ran away, and defendant returned with a &quot;stick,&quot; which was later identified as a &quot;two by two spindle for a railing&quot; that was 30 to 42 inches in length. Defendant hit another worker in the forehead with the stick and scratched that worker's forearm. Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery. He was also convicted of the lesser included offense of burglary under a statute that was amended following the incident to include burglary as a lesser offense of residential burglary. The trial court imposed extended sentences based on his prior convictions. On appeal, the appellate court found that retroactive application of the burglary statute was permissible, all elements of the aggravated burglary charge were proven, and the extended sentences did not violate Apprendi.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, an electrical utility, commissioners of the Illinois Commerce Commission, and others, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which ruled that plaintiff qualified solid waste energy facilities (QSWEF) continued to be eligible for certain benefits under the Retail Rate Law, 220 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8-403.1 (1996). The QSWEF cross-appealed the dismissal of certain their claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the original enactment of the Retail Rate Law, the QWSEFs received special reimbursement rates for electricity they sold to the utility. A 1996 amendment to the Law disqualified them from receiving the rate. The QWSEFs asserted they had a constitutionally protected interest in the rates. The trial court agreed and granted summary judgment on some of the QWSEFs' claims. The trial court dismissed their claims alleging breach of contract by the State and challenging the constitutionality of the amendment. The court affirmed in part, holding that (1) the reach of the amendment was prospective only; (2) because the QWSEFs had no vested right in the continuation of the Law as originally enacted, the prospective application of the amendment of the Law was not constitutionally prohibited, and the amendment served to abolish the subsidies formerly available to the QWSEFs; (3) the Law did not create a contract between the QWSEFs and the State so the QWSEFs' claims of breach of contract failed; (4) the amendment did not violate the special legislation clause in Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 (1970); and (5) the amendment did not violate the &quot;single-subject&quot; rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment. The court dismissed with prejudice the breach of contract claims filed against the utility. The court affirmed the dismissal of the breach of contract claims against the state defendants as well as those claims challenging the constitutionality of the 1996 amendment to the Retail Rate Law.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 335/14(B) (1998). He appealed both his conviction and his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant obtained the fraudulent identification card after his wallet was stolen. He testified that he bought the fraudulent card so that he could get into clubs. He eventually obtained a replacement card for his properly issued resident alien card. Defendant asserted that he &quot;forgot&quot; the fraudulent card was in his wallet, but upon questioning by the trial court, admitted that he used the fraudulent card several times a month to enter nightclubs. The court vacated defendant's sentence, holding that (1) a common purpose ran through &sect; 14B(b)(1)-(6); (2) the penalty for knowing possession of a fraudulent identification card under &sect; 14B(b)(1) was harsher than the penalty imposed for &sect; 14B(b)(2)-(6), which violated the proportionate penalties clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11; (3) there was no common purpose in the statutes governing the fraudulent possession of a resident alien identification card and possession of a false driver's license; (4) 15 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 335/14B (1998) had a legitimate goal of eradicating fraud, which was within the State's police power and did not violate substantive due process; and (5) defendant received effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed but his sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for sentencing in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In appellant inmate's appeal from the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) summarily dismissing his second pro se petition for relief under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq., the State asserted that the reviewing court erred in vacating its earlier dismissal of the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of, in part, first degree murder. The inmate's appeal from the denial of his second post-conviction petition was dismissed for want of prosecution on April 18, 2003. Under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 367(a), the inmate had 21 days, or until May 9, 2003, to file a motion to vacate the dismissal order and reinstate the appeal. The inmate's counsel did not file the motion until May 27, 2003. The State asserted that the reviewing court lacked jurisdiction to grant the inmate's motion to vacate after the 21-day limitations period had passed. The reviewing court agreed. Although a defendant's right to direct appeal could not be lost through appellate counsel's failure to comply with procedural court rules, the inmate's due process right to counsel did not extend to a post-conviction appeal. The inmate's right to counsel was derived from Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c). Because the inmate's due process rights were not implicated in the post-conviction appeal, the reviewing court properly dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction when appellate counsel failed to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 367(a).</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendants' post trial motions for a new trial or transfer back to the juvenile system, and it sentenced them as adults. Affirming, the court held, inter alia, that (1) the Presumptive Transfer Statute was unambiguous and mandated that defendants be sentenced as adults; (2) the armed robbery charge could have been used to transfer defendants; (3) defendants' rights to equal protection under U.S. Const. amend.

The circuit court issued the order directing that the tax deed be issued and the taxpayers filed their posttrial motions, which were denied. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that (1) under 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 200/22-45 (2000), tax deeds were incontestable except by direct appeal or 735 Ill. Comp. Stat.

The technician contacted the police, who also viewed the video. Defendant was arrested after he picked the computer up. Defendant consented to a search of his home, where other child pornography was located. Defendant's challenge to his conviction included constitutional issues, and claims against the sufficiency of his indictment and the evidence. The court affirmed, holding that (1) 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-20.1(a)(2) (2000) was constitutionally sound; (2) the indictment sufficiently alerted defendant that he would need to prepare a defense to charges under &sect; 11-20.1(a)(2)(i),(ii), (iii); (3) once the video on the computer was viewed by the technician, it was no longer subject to Fourth Amendment protection and was properly viewed by the police; (4) the trial court properly excluded other videos on the computer because no search warrant was obtained for them; (5) the consent search was valid; (6) expert testimony was not required to establish that the children in the pornographic materials were under the age of 18; and (7) the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to her first trial, defendant had filed a motion to suppress the statements she made to police. The motion was denied, and the denial was affirmed in defendant's first appeal. After her conviction was vacated, defendant renewed her motion to suppress. The trial court refused to hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion. In her second appeal, defendant contested that refusal and asserted error in the quashing of certain subpoenas, the refusal to allow the jury to review defendant's medical records, and the imposition of an enhanced sentence. The court affirmed in part and vacated in part, holding that (1) the first trial court's decision on the motion to suppress constituted the law of the case and the second trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to revisit the motion; (3) the subpoenas, which sought information about police misconduct in the precinct in which defendant was arrested, were properly quashed where defendant was not asserting that she was physically mistreated; (4) the medical records were not admissible because the defense failed to lay a proper foundation for them, but (5) defendant's enhanced sentence violated Apprendi.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, who was 13 at the time, initially denied hurting her mother, but later confessed to both the police and a youth officer.

Stat. Ann. 55/9-1(a)(2) had to be vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for first degree murder and sentence under the EJJ statute, and it ordered that the dispositional order and the mittimus be amended to reflect only one conviction for first degree murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an emergency medical technician (EMT), brought an interlocutory appeal of Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) decision, granting defendant contractors' 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/ 2-619 (2000) motion and dismissing EMT's complaint. EMT alleged negligence and willful and wanton misconduct with regard to gas line rupture. Petition for rehearing filed subsequent to appellate court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Employees of the contractors were installing underground television cable along a public utility easement when they punctured a gas main. The EMT was among those responding to contend with the leak and to ensure safety. The leaking gas was ignited by an unknown source and the EMT was injured. The contractors based their &sect; 2-619 motion on the Illinois fireman's rule. The trial court dismissed all of the claims against the contractors. The appellate court affirmed in part. The fireman's rule applied to the EMT's negligence action against the contractors but not to his action for willful and wanton misconduct. Thus, dismissal of the willful and wanton misconduct claim was error. The EMT sought a rehearing based on the newly enacted 425 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 25/9f (2003). The appellate court noted that the statute was unclear as to whether it was imposing a new duty on owner/occupiers or was simply codifying a portion of the fireman's rule. Regardless, the appellate court refused to apply the statute retroactively to the EMT's case, ruling that to do so would violate the contractors' due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the EMT's negligence claim against the contractors was affirmed but the dismissal of his willful and wanton misconduct claim was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings. The EMT's petition for rehearing was denied.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that (1) &sect; 11-6.5(a)(1)(ii) was clear and unambiguous on its face and was fully applicable to juveniles; (2) respondent lacked standing to challenge the statute on the basis that it made misdemeanor conduct a felony because he was not tried as an adult nor convicted of a felony; (3) respondent lacked standing to challenge the statute on the basis that it did not require a culpable mental state or criminal purpose because he could not show that he was in the class he asserted would be aggrieved by the unconstitutionality and furthermore, the statute on its face required both a culpable mental state and a criminal purpose; (4) the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to respondent; (5) respondent lacked standing to challenge the statute's sentencing scheme when it had not been applied to him; and (6) respondent was required to register as a sex offender.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part, holding that (1) &sect; 401 did not violate equal protection or substantive due process because its distinctions between possession of ecstasy pills and possession of ecstasy in its powder form had a reasonable basis; (2) prosecutors were restricted to charging under &sect; 401 based on the form of ecstasy defendant had in his possession; (3) the different sentences for violations of &sect; 401(a) and &sect; 401(d) did not violate Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) found defendant guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to 35 years' imprisonment, plus 25 years pursuant to the firearm enhancement provision, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(d) (2000), for a total of 60 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised several issues. The appellate court concluded that defense counsel did not render ineffective assistance of counsel by conceding defendant's guilt and pursuing an unavailable theory of self-defense because the evidence against defendant was overwhelming where he confessed, both in a videotaped statement and in his testimony at trial, to shooting the victim, and two eyewitnesses positively identified defendant as the shooter. Defense counsel's conduct did not constitute a &quot;total failure of legal representation.&quot; His conduct demonstrated an attempt to present a defense, albeit, unsuccessfully, and to test the State's case against defendant. In addition, the firearm enhancement provision, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(d) (2000), did not violate Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, the Proportionate Penalties Clause, because there was no basis to compare two offenses with identical elements where there was only one offense of murder in Illinois. Also, the firearm enhancement provision did not constitute a double enhancement because the firearm factor was not an inherent or essential element of murder and it was only used to impose a longer sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court ordered that the mittimus in the case be corrected to reflect a credit of 696 days for defendant's pretrial custody. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver within 1,000 feet of a school and possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered a directed finding in favor of defendant on the first count and, after a bench trial, convicted defendant of the second count and sentenced him to 12 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly failed to consider his posttrial pro se motion for reduction of sentence. The appellate court found that defendant's motion for reduction of sentence did not fall within the exception for pro se motions alleging ineffective assistance of counsel because his motion failed to raise any issue of ineffectiveness. Therefore, the appellate court had jurisdiction over the instant appeal. Defendant also argued that the trial court should have conducted an inquiry into his allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel's failure to file a motion to quash the arrest and suppress the evidence. The appellate court found no error, as such motions would have been futile; defendant's arrest was based on probable cause, and therefore the search incident thereto was legal. As for defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the appellate court held that the stipulated evidence was sufficient to support the finding that the substance possessed by defendant was cocaine. Finally, as for defendant's sentence, the appellate court held that imposition of sentence upon defendant as a Class X offender was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Ogle County (Illinois) convicting him, after a bench trial, of possessing child pornography in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-20.1 (2000). He argued that the statute was unconstitutional in its application. He also argued, and the State conceded, that he was entitled to a credit against his fines for time spent in custody before sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the invalidation as overbroad of those portions of the federal child pornography statute that prohibited virtual images of children, the highest court in Illinois, in the Alexander case, similarly severed and invalidated a provision in &sect; 11-20.1 that prohibited computer-generated pornographic images of children. That court had, however, specifically rejected constitutional attacks on those portions of the statute dealing with images of real children. Defendant argued that his convictions of violating the &quot;real children&quot; prohibitions of &sect; 11-20.1 were unconstitutional because the prosecution had not proved that the images found in his possession were truly those of real children. The appellate court held that federal and Illinois case law did not place that heavy burden on the State. A finder of fact could still make a judgment as to whether images depicted real people, and the trial court's findings of fact made it clear that it had made such a judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and remanded the matter solely for determination of the amount of credit due against defendant's fines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Illinois) convicting him, as a previously convicted sex offender against children, of three counts of improperly approaching, contacting, or communicating with a child in a public park in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-9.4(a) (2000). His primary argument, among many, challenged the statute as unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose out of defendant's conduct when he approached a high school boys' baseball team as they practiced in a park and spoke with several players. The appellate court held that the statute and the charging instrument both defined the prohibited conduct with sufficient clarity, and that the State presented legally sufficient evidence of defendant's violation. It also held that the statute was a reasonable exercise of the police power to protect children from sex offenders. There was no need to hold separate preliminary hearings on each charge, where they were similar and arose out of the same incident. Counsel was not ineffective in failing to challenge the information or request a bill of particulars, since such challenges could not have succeeded. Finally, the appellate court declined to interfere with the trial court's sentencing decision, reasonably based as it was on defendant's long record and the dangers posed by offenders against children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant appeal arose from defendant's conviction for aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (UUW), under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6(a)(1), (a)(3)(A) (2000) following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was sufficient evidence to show defendant was not on his own land at the time of the crime, aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (UUW) 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6(a)(1), (a)(3)(A) (2000). An officer's testimony showed defendant was standing with a gun in his hand outside of a government housing project. Also, the penalty for aggravated UUW was not unconstitutionally disproportionate under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The seriousness of the conduct to be deterred under the UUW statute justified a higher sentence than the sentence for conduct without a loaded weapon. The UUW statute required a mental state under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6(a)(1) (2000) and was not unconstitutional.&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6(a)(1) (2000) and 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6(a)(3)(A) (2000) were constitutional in that they bore a rational relationship to the public interest served, and the means adopted were reasonably designed to accomplish the desired objective. 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6(a)(1) (2000) did not violate due process and equal protection. There was a rational basis for denying renters the right to possess guns in apartment buildings' common areas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which entered a final judgment and dismissed the inmate's post-conviction petition. The inmate challenged the propriety of the summary dismissal of the petition. The petition was filed pursuant to the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq. (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed his post-conviction petition after his second conviction for a murder was affirmed on direct appeal. In that direct appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court had ruled that the enhancement of the inmate's second sentence based on a weapons violation occurring subsequent to the original conviction was proper. In his appeal of the post-conviction petition dismissal, the inmate asserted that the increase in sentence violated the rule in Apprendi, which was declared subsequent to the second sentencing. The court affirmed. The supreme court's ruling was the law of the case on the enhanced sentence. Further, the Apprendi rule did not apply retroactively, as it was a new constitutional rule that did not fall into one of the two non-retroactive application exceptions set out in Teague v. Lane. And, under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-4 (1985), the trial court could use the weapons violation to extend the inmate's sentence after his second conviction on the murder charge. The conviction operated independently, making the extended-term sentence rule one of the recognized Apprendi exceptions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County (Illinois), which convicted him of unlawful possession of a controlled substance and unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver as a result of cocaine found on his person when he was arrested for violation of Joliet, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 21-10.1 (1990) outlawing loitering for the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the ordinance defining the criminal offense of loitering for the purpose of engaging in a drug-related activity was unconstitutionally vague because the phrase &quot;circumstances manifesting the purpose to engage in drug-related activity&quot; and the ordinance section listing circumstances which might be considered in determining whether such purpose was manifested did not provide adequate notice of the prohibited conduct nor establish minimal guidelines for enforcement. The appellate court concluded that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it failed to provide adequate notice of prohibited conduct and did not delineate adequate enforcement standards. A person reading the ordinance could not know what specific acts would manifest a drug-related purpose. The nine criteria listed in the ordinance for the police to use in determining whether a drug-related purpose had been manifested were not the only circumstances that could be considered. The police were given unfettered discretion to determine whether a person's conduct manifested drug activity. Because the cocaine found on defendant was seized in an unlawful arrest, it had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the State could not prevail on remand without the suppressed evidence, defendant's convictions had to be reversed and the sentence vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment by the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) that dismissed his postconviction petition; defendant claimed that he was denied pretrial notice that the State intended to seek a Class X sentence and that his equal protection rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court imposed a 24-year, Class X prison term partially based on his criminal history. The appellate court held that pretrial notice under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/111-3(c) (1998) was not required since defendant was to be sentenced as Class X offender under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3(c)(8) (1998). Defendant's right to equal protection was not violated. The age classification was not irrational because the attainment of the age of 21 was a well-recognized significant milestone in society. The goal of rehabilitating repeat offenders who were less than 21 years old provided a rational basis and reasonable method for punishing older repeat offenders more severely. Therefore, the trial court did not err in dismissing defendant's claim under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-2.1(a)(2) (2002) as frivolous and patently without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), denied defendant's motion for a new sentencing hearing after it had previously sentenced him in absentia following entry of his guilty plea to a charge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and his failure to appear on two separate dates for sentencing. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. When he did not appear at his sentencing hearing, he was sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison. While he was missing, his attorney filed motions to withdraw his guilty plea and to reconsider his sentence. The trial court never ruled on either motion. He was taken into custody. His motion for a new sentencing hearing was denied. On appeal, the appellate court found that it did not have jurisdiction over his appeal. It so concluded because it found he did not strictly comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d); the failure to obtain rulings on the two motions required dismissal of his appeal under that rule. It also found 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-4.1(g) (2000), regarding new trial or new sentencing hearing motions, did not affect the allotted time for appealing in a criminal case. It explained that his direct appeal rights were not concurrent with his motion for a new sentencing hearing; thus, he could not use the denial of that motion to stall the time limit for filing a direct appeal. Also, since he did not appeal the denial of his new sentencing motion, no issues remained on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's conviction was affirmed on direct appeal after his appellate counsel filed an Anders motion and was allowed to withdraw from the case. During the pendency of the appeal, the inmate filed his post-conviction petition, attacking the constitutionality of his sentence and generally citing to several constitutional amendments. Post-trial counsel was appointed. The State moved to dismiss the petition. Appointed counsel did not amend the inmate's pro se petition but filed an Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c) certificate of compliance, indicating that the petition adequately represented the inmate's constitutional claims. The motion to dismiss was granted. On appeal, the inmate asserted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and of post-conviction counsel. The court affirmed. The inmate waived any issue as to effective assistance of appellate counsel by failing to include the claim in his petition. Post-conviction counsel's obligations were governed by Rule 651(c), not the Strickland test. She was not required to search the record for additional constitutional claims the inmate might have asserted and her failure to do so was not a breach of any of her Rule 651(c) obligations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hotel sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which entered judgment against the hotel, denied its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), or in the alternative, for a new trial, and granted summary judgment to defendant electric company on an indemnity crossclaim. The judgment was entered in plaintiff guest's negligence action against the hotel and the electric company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guest was injured when he received an electric shock from a switch that turned on lights over a vanity in his hotel room. The shock caused him to jump back and strike his shoulder on a door frame. Testimony from maintenance personnel at the hotel established that while they were aware that short circuits did occurr in the vanity lights, they had never heard of such a short circuit causing a shock at the light switch. The guest did not present any expert evidence on the issue. The jury returned a general verdict against the hotel, finding it solely liable for the guest's injury. On appeal, the hotel argued that its JNOV motion should have been granted because it did not owe any duty to the guest. The court agreed. The existence of duty, including the element of whether an injury was reasonably foreseeable, was an initial question of law for the trial court to answer before a negligence case could be submitted to a jury. The presence of a short in the vanity light fixture was not a sufficient predicate for the hotel to anticipate the danger of an electric shock at the light switch because, under the facts of the case, the risk of such a shock was not reasonably foreseeable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment against the hotel and in favor of the guest was reversed. The appeal of the grant of summary judgment to the electric company was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer saw defendant's car speed past him.

The officer approached, and saw that defendant's eyes were glassy and bloodshot. The officer also smelled a strong odor of alcohol on her breath. The officer then administered certain sobriety tests. Defendant failed the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, but passed three other tests. The officer then asked her to submit to a portable breath test (PBT) and she agreed to do so. The result indicated defendant was intoxicated. Defendant was arrested and her driving privileges were suspended for three months. At a statutory summary suspension proceeding, the trial court admitted the result over defendant's objection. At the end of the hearing, the trial court found the officer's testimony credible and denied her petition to rescind the suspension. On appeal, the appellate court found that the statute authorizing the PBT was constitutional, the officer had reasonable suspicion to ask her to submit to the PBT, and the State was not required to show an adequate foundation to introduce the test results.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pharmaceutical group alleged that the county violated state law and its own competitive bidding ordinance by using requests for information and requests for proposals to award a contract to supply prescription medication and other pharmaceuticals to the county. The pharmaceutical group also claimed that the county's board of commissioners improperly delegated its power to expend taxpayer funds for the purchase of pharmaceuticals to the county's comptroller. The county argued that it was not subject to the competitive bidding laws due to its status as a home rule entity under the Illinois Constitution and that the contract at issue was not adapted to competitive bidding. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly granted the county's motion to dismiss as the county did not violate state law as it was not acting administratively, or its own ordinance as the ordinance, and the contract was not adaptable to competitive bidding. Further, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the county and against the pharmaceutical group in the other suit as the county did not improperly transfer power from one branch of government to another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of possession of a stolen motor vehicle and possession of a controlled substance. Because of his prior convictions, the trial court sentenced defendant to eight years' imprisonment for possession of a stolen motor vehicle under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3(c)(8) (2000), concurrent to his one-year sentence for possession of a controlled substance. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to trial, the trial court granted defense counsel's request to order a clinical examination of defendant. On its own motion, the court ordered a second examination. The examiners did not find defendant unfit for trial. On appeal, the court found that, considering defendant's behavior, his demeanor at trial, and the prior medical opinion on his competence to stand trial, no bona fide doubt of defendant's fitness to stand trial existed and thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to conduct a fitness hearing. Defendant was able to understand the nature of the proceedings, assist in his own defense, and did not establish a bona fide doubt as to his fitness. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to sua sponte order a fitness hearing. Further, by consenting to the admission of the stipulation of a forensic chemist's opinion at trial, defendant could not object to the admission of that stipulation for the first time on appeal. Furthermore, the court declined to review the issue as plain error. Finally, the mandatory Class X offender provision was constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Illinois Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a gang member, beat a rival gang member to death with a tire jack after the victim rammed the car defendant was in. After the jury found defendant guilty of murder, the trial court found that the crime was committed with exceptional brutality. On that basis, an extended term sentence was imposed. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on second degree murder and that prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. Defendant also challenged his extended-term sentence. The court affirmed in part, holding that (1) while there was some evidence of provocation, the severe beating defendant gave the victim was disproportionate to the provocation and the refusal to instruct on second degree murder was not an abuse of discretion; (2) improper arguments made by the prosecution, which were not objected to, did not deprive defendant of a fair trial and did not amount to plain error; but (3) the extended-term sentence under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(2), 5-8-2(a)(1) (1996) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant because the jury made no finding that defendant was death penalty eligible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit, Peoria County, Illinois. No. 01--CF--17. Honorable Donald C. Courson, Judge Presiding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit, Peoria County, Illinois, which entered judgment on a jury determination that defendant was guilty of two felony murders under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(a)(3) (2000) and sentenced defendant to natural life imprisonment under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(c)(ii) (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went with two accomplices to rob victim one in his home. Once there, victim one stated that he kept his money at his mother's home. The actual shooter accompanied victim one to his mother's home but left defendant, and a gun the shooter provided to defendant, with victim two, victim one's girlfriend. The shooter returned alone and told defendant to leave. Defendant left and then heard a shot. The three conspirators then fled the scene. On appeal, defendant questioned the sufficiency of the evidence to convict him of the two murders and argued that his sentence was unconstitutional as applied. The court affirmed. Defendant was accountable for felony murder of victim one because he willingly accompanied the others to victim one's home with the intent to rob him, he continued to participate in the enterprise by staying at that location with victim two, and he did not report the incident to police. As to victim two, the robbery was not over simply because defendant left the apartment. The threat of force against her continued until she was killed, making defendant accountable for her death. Finally, the natural life sentence did not violate defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), entered a final judgment of conviction after it found defendant guilty of the first-degree murder of her husband. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim, her husband, began to argue. The victim went to his mother's house nearby. Defendant succeeded in luring him back to their apartment. The victim was soon found dead of a gunshot wound. Defendant later gave a statement. In it, she said she fully loaded a shotgun with shotgun shells. Defendant then lured the victim back to their apartment, picked up the gun, and shot him to death. At trial, she changed her story and said she accidentally fired the gun, killing the victim. In a bench trial, the trial court found the statement to be more credible and convicted her of first-degree murder. It then enhanced her sentence with an additional sentence for discharging a firearm and causing a death during an offense. On appeal, the appellate court found that the additional sentence did not violate the Illinois Constitution's Proportionate Penalties Clause, its separation of powers principles, or its Double Jeopardy Clause, and did not constitute an impermissible double enhancement of the offense of first-degree murder or her sentence. Also, it found that evidence was sufficient to convict her of first-degree murder and that she personally discharged a firearm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/16A-4 (2000) of the retail theft statute was unconstitutional because it contained a mandatory presumption that relieved the State of its burden to prove the element of intent. The appellate court agreed that the presumption contained in &sect; 16-4 was constitutionally infirm but concluded that it could be severed from the remainder of the retail theft statute and intent could be inferred by surrounding circumstances and proved by circumstantial evidence. It assumed the trial judge found the defendant guilty of retail theft without relying on the constitutionally infirm presumption, but rather, inferred the requisite intent from the surrounding circumstances. The appellate court also found the merchant's uncontradicted testimony that he identified himself to the defendant, if believed, was sufficient to establish that the defendant knew that he was a merchant. Because defense counsel did not entirely fail to subject the State's case to meaningful adversarial testing, prejudice was not presumed.</SPAN></P>

At the hearing on a motion to suppress statements, a police officer testified he investigated a possible incident of sexual abuse between the 13-year-old juvenile and a 6-year-old neighbor girl. After being read his Miranda rights, the juvenile gave a verbal statement, followed by a written statement. He admitted placing his penis in the mouth of the neighbor girl. The court denied the motion to suppress. He was adjudicated delinquent after a stipulated adjudicatory hearing. The appellate court held that the aggravated criminal sexual assault statute did not violate due process as the juvenile argued on appeal, and the juvenile properly was sentenced as a class X offender under the statute. Since the appellate court determined that the juvenile was properly sentenced as a class X offender, his five-year probation was mandatory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father filed a petition in the Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit, Peoria County (Illinois), seeking termination (or alternatively, modification) of an order granting visitation rights to appellees, his child's maternal grandparents. The judge denied his petition and a subsequent motion to reconsider. He filed an appeal claiming the judge erred because the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the visitation order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the mother died in childbirth, the father's child resided in foster care with the grandparents for almost five years. In 2002, in Wickham v. Byrne, the Illinois Supreme Court held that 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/607(b)(1), (3) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, authorizing courts to order grandparent visitation upon a finding that such visitation was in the best interests and welfare of the child, were unconstitutional. The father claimed that the holding declaring the grandparent visitation statute unconstitutional voided appellee grandparents' visitation order as a matter of law. The appellate court found that, although &sect; 607(b)(1), (3) were intended to supersede the common law, such intent was never realized because the statute was invalid from its inception, and the unconstitutionality of &sect; 607(b)(1), (3) did not void the grandparents' visitation rights as a matter of law. However, as a matter of fact, a visitation order had to pass scrutiny under the principles articulated in Wickham.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended the police lacked probable cause to justify his arrest and his confession should be suppressed because the police failed to take him before a judge for a probable cause determination before he confessed.

Defendant's confession occurred 73 hours after his custodial detention began; police made no attempt to present him to a judge for a probable cause hearing during those 73 hours. Presentment did not come for another l4 1/2 hours. The 73-hour detention before defendant made his confession far exceeded the 48-hour period for a presumably reasonable delay. Accordingly, the burden fell on the State to show an emergency or extraordinary circumstance was to blame. The State never attempted to make such a showing. Defendant's lawful detention became unlawful in violation of the Fourth Amendment after 48 hours. No intervening circumstances explained defendant's decision to confess after twice denying involvement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) convicting defendant of possession of a counterfeit credit card in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 250/16 (2002) and sentencing defendant to five years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer observed defendant place a bag of six counterfeit credit cards in a door panel of the van. The trial court found that defendant's possession of more than two counterfeit credit cards constituted prima facie evidence that defendant intended to defraud pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 250/16 (2002). The appellate court found that the second sentence of &sect; 16, which allowed the presumption made by the trial court, constituted an impermissible mandatory rebuttable presumption. Defendant's intent to defraud was established only by the State's evidence showing that defendant possessed six counterfeit credit cards. As such, the State was effectively relieved of its burden of proving defendant's intent to defraud beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden shifted to defendant to prove that she was merely holding the bag and had no knowledge of its contents. This was an unconstitutional shift of the evidentiary burden. The second sentence of &sect; 16 was severable under 5 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 70/1.31 (2002), because the excision of the second sentence, which operated only to ease the State's burden of proof, did not impair the meaning or operation of the remainder of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois), which entered judgment on a jury verdict that found defendant to be a sexually violent person pursuant to the Illinois Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/1 through 99 (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to criminal sexual assault on his six-year old stepsister, which began when defendant was 12 years old. He was sentenced to intensive probation, which was revoked after defendant was found trying to lure another young girl to a secluded area for a sexual offense. He was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment. Prior to his scheduled mandatory supervised release, a petition was filed seeking to have defendant civilly committed to the State's sex offender treatment program. The evidence at trial was conflicting as to whether defendant was at high risk for repeat offenses. The State's witnesses relied extensively on psychological testing and actuarial data to predict the potential for recidivism. The court reversed because the actuarial instruments used by the State's experts did not satisfy the Frye test for admissibility. The actuarial instruments, which added a quality of mathematical or objective certainty to what was otherwise the subjective opinion of the experts, instilled a false sense of confidence in the expert's opinions. Further, the instruments were of recent development, were controversial, and had not been subjected to empirical testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed his ex-girlfriend and tried to kill her boyfriend. The appellate court held the trial court's use of a special interrogatory asking if the murder was exceptionally brutal or heinous, under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2(b) (2000), allowing an extended sentence, was not error. It did not add an element to the crime, contrary to ex post facto prohibitions, as it was a sentencing factor. Photographs of the murder victim's injuries, corroborating testimony of crime scene technicians, and helping the jury understand a pathologist's testimony, were admissible. Erroneously admitted hearsay about defendant's prior threats did not require a new trial given overwhelming evidence of his guilt. Testimony of defendant's tumultuous relationship with the murder victim was not hearsay, and any error in admitting it was harmless. The prosecutor could play a tape and read from a letter admitted into evidence during his closing. Defendant's armed violence conviction was based on the same act as the attempted murder and had to be vacated, but he could be convicted of home invasion and murder, despite the interrelationship of the acts those convictions were based on.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, defendant argued that the police officer did not have probable cause to seize and search the box the officer observed during the traffic stop, and, as a result, the weapons located during the officer's subsequent search of the vehicle were tainted fruit that should have been suppressed. The appellate court concluded that the officer did not have probable cause to search either the box in defendant's front shirt pocket or the remainder of the vehicle's contents because the only reason offered by the officer justifying his search of the box was the officer's conclusion that the box was &quot;drug paraphernalia.&quot; However, the officer testified that this was only a suspicion that was confirmed after he had opened the box. Further, the officer conceded that the box could contain a variety of non-illicit items and that it did not have only one purpose. In addition, the State did not demonstrate beyond a preponderance of the evidence that the officer's discovery of either or both of the weapons observed in defendant's vehicle would have been inevitable.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that (1) the legislative purposes of the two offenses defendant sought to compare to aggravated sexual assault for purposes of the proportionality test, female genital mutilation and first degree murder, were different from the legislative purpose of the aggravated sexual assault statute, and therefore, could not be used for proportionality comparison purposes; (2) under Apprendi, defendant's prior conviction did not have to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) as defendant's had a right to trial by jury when he committed his initial offense, 720 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Elmwood Park, Ill., Ordinance 2001-08 (2001) banned video gaming devices throughout the village, although officials admitted that they only enforced the ban against public places. The bar removed its slot machines and similar games, but challenged the ordinance's constitutionality. The appellate court held that the bar had not met the heavy burden of showing unconstitutionality. First, gambling games devoid of narrative or intellectual content were not protected expression under the First Amendment as some sophisticated games were. The appeals court examined the claims of substantive due process and equal protection violation solely to ascertain whether the ordinance bore a rational relationship to controlling illegal gambling, and found that it did. The village was within its powers in determining that electronic gambling in public posed the greatest threat to public welfare. Finally, the bar could not challenge the ordinance as vague when it admitted that it knew that its machines had violated it.</SPAN></P>

Honorable Barbara Gilleran Johnson, Judge, Presiding.  <BR>LaSalle Nat'l Bank v. City of Highland Park, 2003 Ill. App. LEXIS 1230 (Ill. App. Ct., Sept. 29, 2003)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois) dismissing a complaint against defendants, the city, its zoning board, and various officials, seeking review of the board's denial of a variance allowing them to build on the second of two contiguous, undersized lots. They also challenged the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the landowners bought their two lots, only one of which had been built on, each lot was too small for a single-family dwelling under an ordinance then in effect, as well as the ordinance in effect many years later when they sought a variance to build on the second lot. The appellate court first reviewed the board's decision, deferentially, to assure that it was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, which it was not. The appellate court then addressed the constitutional challenges. It found no federal due process violation, amounting to an uncompensated taking, because there was no showing that the landowners had not done well off their long-term investment, with or without development. Furthermore, although it was not conclusive, it was significant that the landowners had known of the limitation when they bought the property. It was not an unreasonable exercise of the police power for the city to seek to maintain low density in certain areas. Finally, zoning ordinance application was inevitably fact intensive, so it was not necessarily unreasonable, arbitrary, or violative of equal protection to deny the variance even though others' requests had been granted.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 550/5(f) (2000) after denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer pulled defendant over for tailgating. A criminal history inquiry indicated that defendant had been arrested for drug possession. There was an outstanding warrant for defendant's arrest in another county. Defendant told the officer that he and the passenger were going to Mississippi. The officer completed the warning ticket and gave it to defendant. The officer kept defendant's driver's license and spoke to the passenger. The passenger said they were going to a destination in Illinois. The officer asked for permission to search the vehicle, which defendant initially granted but then revoked. A canine unit indicated the presence of drugs. The officer searched the vehicle and found cannabis. The trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress. The traffic stop was complete when the officer issued defendant a warning ticket. At that time, the officer knew that the interior of the car smelled like air freshener that he suspected was used to mask the smell of cannabis, and he knew of the warrant, defendant's criminal record, and that defendant was going to Mississippi. This did not constitute a reasonable and articulable suspicion to extend the stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of aggravated battery, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-4(b)(1) (Supp. 2001). The Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) sentenced him to an extended term of six years in prison, based on a prior conviction, and ordered that within two years of his release from prison, defendant pay $ 10,026 in restitution to the hospital that treated the victim. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court violated his rights to due process and effective assistance of counsel when it conducted voir dire without a court reporter present. The appellate court found no error, since, inter alia, defendant made no claim of error; as such, lack of the record deprived him of nothing. Defendant next argued that trial counsel did not have the authority to waive the court reporter's presence because that decision belonged to defendant. The appellate court held that in a criminal case, the decision whether to waive a court reporter's presence during voir dire remained with defense counsel. As for the restitution order, the appellate court noted that the trial court could order restitution regardless of the term of incarceration or defendant's financial resources. Finally, the appellate court found no error in defendant's extended term sentence since 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann.5/5-8-2(a) (2000) did not require the State to prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt defendant's prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

Ann. 5/24-1.1(a) (2000). Defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for new trial was denied. The Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to a five-year prison term. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.1(a) (2000) was unconstitutional because it required no culpable mental state and permitted a felony conviction based on innocent conduct. The appellate court disagreed, finding that &sect; 24-1.1 was reasonably designed to remedy the evils the legislature found to be a threat to public safety. Defendant also contended that the trial court erroneously refused his request to stipulate his prior convictions, in violation of the holding in People v. Peete. Defendant acknowledged the error was not raised in his posttrial motion but contended that it could be reviewed under the plain-error doctrine. The appellate court found plain error under both prongs of the plain error rule, since the evidence was closely balanced and the error was fundamental. The jury should have known defendant was a felon and could not possess a firearm. This jury should not have been informed of defendant's four felony convictions by name and reminded several times by the prosecution that defendant was a four-time convicted felon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was reversed and the action was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant got on top of the victim, who was facedown on the ground. Defendant hit the victim in the head with a rock. He passed the rock to his wife and stayed on top of the victim while she hit the victim. Defendant sat on top of the victim for at least 15 minutes before the victim quit struggling. The victim's body was found wrapped with chains and cans filled with concrete in a lake. The prosecuting attorney was from the State's attorney appellate prosecutor's office, and he was appointed as a special prosecutor. The prosecutor was improperly appointed as a special prosecutor. Defendant, however, waived his right to challenge the prosecutor's defective commission to prosecute. Defendant did not object to the prosecutor, nor was defendant harmed by participation of the special prosecutor, who was a licensed attorney. Defendant was not entitled to an involuntary manslaughter jury instruction, because the length of the struggle, at least 15 minutes, precluded an involuntary manslaughter conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died in 2001. She left a will which nominated her two sons, appellee and appellant, as co-executors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court erred when it refused to disqualify appellee from serving as executor pursuant to 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-13(a) (2002) because he was a convicted felon. Specifically, the issue was whether the limitation on felons serving as executors contained in 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-13 violated equal protection. The appellate court concluded that an executor was entrusted with property to which others had claims and had to safeguard that property and ultimately distribute it in accordance with the law. A convicted felon had demonstrated an inability to act within the confines of the law. This provided a more than adequate basis for the legislative determination that felons were not qualified to act as executors. Therefore, the appellate court concluded that 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-13 did not violate equal protection because it disqualified felons from acting as executors. The statute was constitutional on its face. Because appellee's status as a felon was not disputed at the trial level, the trial court was not required to make additional determinations of fact or to consider any additional factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's order denying appellant's motion to disqualify appellee, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fire protection district appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois), which granted a motion to dismiss filed by defendants, a golf club and the county, in the district's action seeking an injunction against defendants to enforce a district ordinance regarding the installation of fire sprinklers. The ordinance was enacted pursuant to authority in the Illinois Fire Protection District Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a building permit issued by the county, the club built a clubhouse that did not contain sprinklers, even though the district had advised the club that a district ordinance required sprinklers. The clubhouse sat within both the district and an unincorporated area of the county. The district sought an injunction to prevent the county from issuing an occupancy permit and to prevent the club from using the clubhouse. It also sought a declaration that it had authority pursuant to 70 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 705/11 (2002) to enact and enforce ordinances within the unincorporated portions of the county. Section 11 precluded the district from enacting ordinances where a municipality had adopted fire protection laws. The county asserted it was such a municipality. The court disagreed, holding that (1) based on the definition of municipalities in the Illinois Constitution, the county was not a municipality; (2) the district had concurrent jurisdiction with the county with regard to fire prevention laws; (3) as their ordinances were not in conflict, the club had to comply with both entities ordinances; but (4) the district could not seek enforcement of its ordinances by the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), defendant was found guilty of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and sentenced to five years in prison. Defendant appealed his sentence based on an improper enhancement, the Apprendi doctrine, and a violation of the proportional penalties clause in Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court enhanced defendant's sentence under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.1(e) based upon a finding that defendant had previously been convicted of armed violence. The armed violence conviction was based on defendant's commission of the predicate felony of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. The appellate court affirmed but modified defendant's conviction. Armed violence was not an inherently violent offense, and there was insufficient evidence to show that defendant had contemplated the use of force or violence in committing the possession of a controlled substance felony. Therefore, it could not be considered a forcible felony under the catch-all category for forcible felonies in 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-8 (2000), and the armed violence conviction could not be used to enhance defendant's sentence. Resentencing was required. And while armed violence was similar to the charge of unlawful discharge of a weapon, which carried a lesser sentence, the sentencing range for armed violence did not violate the proportionality clause. The two crimes were enacted for different purposes, making a comparative proportionality analysis inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but modified it to reflect that it was for a Class 3 rather than a Class 2 felony. The court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded the case for defendant's resentencing. The court did not reach the Apprendi argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant township road district sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which granted summary judgment to appellee tax objectors on one of nine tax objections that challenged a 1996 property tax levy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objection asserted that a portion of the 1996 tax levy that was designated for a &quot;permanent road fund&quot; was invalid. The district asserted that the road fund was authorized by a special hard road tax levy that was approved in a 1979 referendum pursuant to provisions of the Illinois Highway Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 1-101 et seq. (1977). On appeal, the objectors asserted that the referendum had expired by force of law five years after it was approved. At issue was whether the repeal of the five-year limitation shortly after the 1979 referendum was approved applied retroactively. The court ruled that it did not. The five-year limit was found in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, paras. 6-601, 6-602 (1977). It was removed by Ill. Pub. Acts 81-779, 81-821. The effect of the public acts was made retroactive by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 6-602.1 (1979). But para. 6-602.1 was eliminated in 1980 by Ill. Pub. Act 81-1509 (1980). That same Act left intact the prospective application of the elimination of the five-year period and the procedures outlined in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 121, para. 6-617 (1979). As the district failed to renew the referendum, it expired by law after five years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted a petition by the State and terminated the parental rights of respondent, a mother, with respect to her minor son pursuant to 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/2-29(2) (1998) and 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(q) (1998). The mother appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(q) (1998) violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions. Under that section, a parent was presumed unfit if the parent had been criminally convicted of aggravated battery, heinous battery, or attempted murder of any child. The mother had been convicted of the attempted murder of another her children by poisoning the child with a cleaning solution. The appellate court found no basis supporting an argument that the statute violated a party's due process rights merely because the statute required a finding of unfitness as a matter of law based on a prior conviction involving the attempted murder of a child. The appellate court further held that the statute did not violate the equal protection clause. The statute created a method for the State to have a parent declared unfit for the protection of children because of a prior conviction, and did not create classifications for administering direct punishment for convictions. The appellate court finally held that the trial court properly determined that termination was in the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) on two counts of aggravated criminal assault and was sentenced to two consecutive 60-year terms of imprisonment. Defendant appealed, arguing that (1) the circuit court erred in admitting other-crimes evidence involving him in a prior sexual assault, and (2) his sentence was unconstitutional under the Apprendi doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assaulted a young neighbor on numerous occasions. The prior crime evidence also involved a neighbor child. Defendant's wife took part in both sets of assaults by procuring the children for defendant, &quot;preparing&quot; them for the assaults, and then physically aiding defendant in accomplishing the assaults. The court affirmed both defendant's conviction and his sentence. The assistance given by the wife to defendant in the commission of both crimes was a distinctive common feature sufficient to support the trial court's admission of the other crimes evidence to show defendant's modus operandi. As both the trial court and the prosecution went to great lengths to be sure that the jury understood the limited evidentiary value of the other-crimes evidence, there was no abuse of discretion in the ruling that the evidence's probative value outweighed any prejudice to defendant. Finally, although defendant's extended term sentence, based on a trial court finding that defendant's crime was particularly brutal and heinous, violated Apprendi, the error did not warrant reversal because it did not affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) denied defendant's motion to suppress and defendant's motion for a new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, (2) 625 Ill. Comp.

The appellate court concluded that the statement made by defendant in which he admitted smoking marijuana in his vehicle just before driving was not the result of custodial interrogation, and therefore Miranda warnings were not required as a prerequisite for admitting the statement into evidence. Also, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-501(a)(6) was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant was not found guilty based on whim or caprice but, rather, based on evidence that proved defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of driving under the influence of cannabis, including: (1) the officer's testimony that he smelled a strong odor of cannabis in defendant's vehicle and on defendant's breath, (2) defendant's admission that he smoked cannabis in his vehicle just before driving his vehicle, (3) defendant's slurred speech, (4) defendant's dilated pupils, and (5) defendant's motor skills being slower than average.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another man were both convicted of kidnapping and rape, on strong evidence. DNA testing was not available at the time of defendant's trial, and many years later he moved for such testing pursuant to &sect; 116-3. The trial court held that because of the overwhelming evidence of guilt, DNA results could not possibly have constituted new evidence materially relevant to the question of actual innocence, but the appellate court held that under the statute, the trial court should not have made that call, because even though the possibility was not great, a complete non-match between defendant's DNA and genetic material found on clothing items and on the victim's vaginal swabs would still have been significant, even though by no means conclusive, on his claim of actual innocence. Although defendant's post-conviction challenge to his sentence failed, because the rule of Apprendi did not apply retroactively, nor was it violated by life sentences for habitual offenders, favorable DNA test results might support a future post-conviction relief petition based on a claim of actual innocence.</SPAN></P>

Ann. 5/2-402, and thereafter, it granted the extension. The doctors appealed by certified question as to whether the trial court had the discretion under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 183 to grant the extension. The court reviewed the meaning and purpose of 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-402 and concluded that it was not ambiguous. It further found that &sect; 2-402 was a special statutory action and as such, the time limitations contained therein were not subject to extension under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 183. Further, Rule 183 only applied to time limits set forth in Illinois Supreme Court Rules and was therefore inapplicable to a statutory time limit. The court dismissed arguments that custom and practice or an unjust result required that the extensions be allowed, and noted that the doctors were not engaged in delay or evasive tactics to squander the six-month period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question in the negative. The extension orders were vacated and the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department's initial &quot;indicated&quot; finding was issued based on &quot;credible evidence&quot; in support of a report that plaintiff had sexually abused an 11-year-old girl.

The ALJ issued an opinion denying the expungement request. The Department adopted the ALJ's decision. Plaintiff filed his court action, and the trial court upheld the Department's decision. The appellate court reversed, holding that (1) plaintiff had a liberty interest in keeping his name off the State's suspected child abuser register; (2) the Department violated plaintiff's due process rights when it failed to comply with time limitations regarding hearings and final decisions found in Ill. Admin. Code ch. 89, &sect; 336.220(a) (2001) and 325 Ill. Comp. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was taken into temporary custody shortly after his birth. Four older siblings were already in the State's custody due to the parents' problems. The father had drug problems, and the mother had a personality disorder that impaired her ability to parent. Both parents claimed to have been receiving help with their problems, but no actual evidence was presented to prove their contentions. A psychologist testified that without intensive psychotherapy, the mother would not be a good parenting candidate. The court affirmed, holding that (1) the failure to hold a temporary custody hearing within the time limit in 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/2-9(1) (2000) did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction in the matter but would only have required the son's release from custody on proper motion; (2) the parents waived their 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/2-14(d) (2000) &quot;timely adjudication&quot; argument; (3) the allegations of the State's petition reasonably informed the parents as to the nature of the neglect charge; and (4) the parents' past history, the psychological testimony offered, and the mother's failure to follow through with counseling, all supported the trial court's orders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a 24-hour continuance to secure a witness because the witness would have exculpated defendant. The appellate court found that defense counsel made diligent efforts to call the witness, but declined to find any error since defendant failed to demonstrate that the witness's testimony would have been material to the case and thus, failed to prove prejudice. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him to an extended-term sentence because it improperly retroactively utilized a recently amended version of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-2 (2000). The appellate court concluded that defendant could be sentenced in accordance with the statutory scheme as long as the procedures utilized comported with Apprendi and because the amended version of &sect; 5-8-2 only addressed procedural aspects for complying with Apprendi, there was nothing to prohibit its application. Finally, the appellate court disagreed with defendant that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11 1-3(c-5) (2000) was unconstitutional because it allowed the State to add elements of an offense by only giving written notification to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erroneously declined his tendered jury instructions on second-degree murder based on the provocation of mutual combat and on self-defense.

In addition, there was no evidence that defendant acted under an objectively reasonable belief that the threat presented required use of a handgun. Defendant also argued that the trial court's failure to consider the jury's request for transcripts was reversible error. The appellate court concluded that even if such were an error, it was harmless in light of defendant's objection at the time of the jury's request. Finally, the appellate court concluded that defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that he received an unconstitutional sentence when the trial court imposed the 25-year sentence enhancement mandated by 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(d)(iii); the appellate court found no violation of the Proportionate Penalties Clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, or improper double enhancement.</SPAN></P>

The bag was confiscated and small packets of cocaine were found inside. On appeal, defendant made several arguments including insufficient evidence, unconstitutional sentencing, and improper consideration of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The court affirmed, holding that (1) the evidence was sufficient to show defendant had constructive possession of the cocaine and that the totality of the circumstances showed an intent to deliver the drugs; (2) defendant failed to raise any colorable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to show that he was prejudiced by any of his counsel's alleged deficiencies; and (3) defendant's sentence under 730 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was confronted by seven to nine armed, uniformed police officers after he exited his vehicle and walked toward a house. The officers had gathered to take part in a &quot;knock and talk&quot; program meant to garner information that might be useful in drug investigations. While surrounded by the officers on three sides, defendant was asked if he had any drugs on him and he was also asked to consent to a search. The arresting officer testified that defendant consented to a search, which yielded fourteen small bags of what was believed to be cannabis. Defendant's vehicle was then searched, yielding two more bags of cannabis. Defendant asserted that he was illegally detained. The court agreed and affirmed. The State admitted that the officers had no probable cause to stop defendant with regard to any crime, thus the encounter was not a Terry stop. Under the totality of the circumstances, it was reasonable for defendant to believe he was being detained. As the detention was unlawful under the Fourth Amendment, defendant's consent to the search was ineffective. The evidence obtained as a result of the illegal detention was properly excluded as &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Nos. 00-0233 &amp; 00-0335 Consolidated.  <BR>Harrisonville Tel. Co. v. Ill. Commerce Comm'n, 2003 Ill. App. LEXIS 639 (Ill. App. Ct., May 23, 2003)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a telephone association and several individual rural telephone companies, appealed an order of respondent Illinois Commerce Commission, which established a state universal service fund for small rural telephone companies pursuant to the Illinois Public Utilities Act, 220 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-101 et seq. (2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In establishing the universal fund, the Commission determined both an &quot;affordable rate&quot; for rural services and that the fund would apply only to primary access lines for homes and businesses. Petitioners sought a rehearing, which produced an order that changed the affordable rate by lowering it, but did not change the Commission's decision regarding lines that would be covered by the fund. The court first ruled that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal under the Act because nothing in the Act required petitioners to seek a second rehearing on the issues and in fact, 220 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-113(a) (2000) limited petitioners to one rehearing. The court reversed the Commission's order regarding the lines to be covered by the fund. The state's fund was to mirror the federal universal support fund and 47 C.F.R. &sect; 54.101(a)(1) (1998) did not limit the federal fund to primary access lines. The court affirmed the affordable rate set by the Commission. Setting the rate was within the Commission's power and the court was unwilling to find that the rate set by the Commission was not supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the Commission's order regarding funding for primary access lines only but affirmed the remainder of the Commission's order. The court remanded the case for further proceedings relative to the inclusion of all access lines in the funding amounts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which entered judgment on a jury's verdict of guilty against defendant on a charge of reckless homicide and a charge of driving with a revoked license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the reckless homicide statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3 (2000), and the jury instructions based on the statute were unconstitutional because they contained mandatory irrebuttable presumptions that relieved the State of its burden to prove recklessness and intoxication beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. Section 9-3(b) did contain an unconstitutional presumption that being under the influence of alcohol or drugs was presumed to be evidence of a reckless act unless disproved by other evidence. However, the trial court had granted defendant's motion that the jury not be instructed on &sect; 9-3(b) so no error occurred. Section 9-3(c)(1), which provided that a person was under the influence of alcohol for purposes of reckless homicide where the person's blood-alcohol level exceeded 0.08, did not require a jury to find a person guilty of reckless homicide based on that presumption. Thus, &sect; 9-3(c)(1) was constitutional and its application was not effected by the status of &sect; 9-3(b). Finally, it was not improper to give both Ill. Pattern Jury Instructions, Crim. No. 7.09X and 23.30 (4th ed.).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3(a) (2000), of a victim less than 12 years old. At the sentencing hearing, the Circuit Court of Jo Daviess County (Illinois) found that the victim was a family or household member and ruled that the offense was elevated from a Class 3 felony to a Class 2 felony. The trial court imposed a 10-year prison term and a $ 100 domestic violence fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that he could not be convicted of the involuntary manslaughter of a family or household member because it was not a lesser-included offense of first-degree murder. Specifically, defendant argued that his due process rights were violated because the charging instrument did not allege the family-or-household-member element and the jury did not find the element beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court concluded that in cases involving the conviction of a lesser-included offense, the family-or-household-member fact was an element of the offense of involuntary manslaughter, and the element had to be identified in an instrument charging the greater offense. The offense of involuntary manslaughter of a family or household member was not a lesser-included offense of first-degree murder as charged in the superceding indictment because the murder charge did not allege that the victim was a &quot;family or household member&quot; as defined by 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/112A-3 (2000). Also, the State conceded that the trial court erred in ordering defendant's fine to be drawn from defendant's bond.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the cause was remanded for the entry of a new judgment of conviction pursuant to the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the trial court's dismissal of defendant's postconviction petition, the appellate court noted first that, contrary to defendant's argument, there was no requirement for courts to look beyond the face of the public act itself. In addition, defendant's contention that the provisions of an enactment must relate to each other was repeatedly rejected by the supreme court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's probation was revoked, a jury found him guilty of aggravated kidnapping, armed violence, and unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon. The Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) sentenced him to, inter alia, 40 years in prison for aggravated kidnapping, which included an automatic 15-year firearm enhancement, and also resentenced defendant to 10 years in prison for attempt. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the 15-year enhancement for aggravated kidnapping violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Defendant contended that the offenses of aggravated kidnapping and armed violence predicated on the offense of kidnapping while carrying a category I weapon had identical elements, but carried difference sentences. The appellate court held that the 15-year enhancement for aggravated kidnapping violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution and was unenforceable. Defendant also argued that the trial court considered an improper factor, the presence of a firearm, as an aggravating factor in sentencing him. As defendant failed to include this issue in his post-trial motion, the appellate court considered it under plain error review. The appellate court concluded that defendant's argument did not satisfy either requirement of the plain error rule. The appellate court noted that the trial court's comment that defendant had escalated his choice of weapons in that he armed himself with a firearm was not so egregious as to deprive defendant of a fair sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 15-year enhancement for defendant's aggravated kidnapping conviction was vacated and the case was remanded with directions that the trial court issue an amended written judgment to reflect that defendant's sentence for aggravated kidnapping was 25 years. In all other respects the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted at a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon.

The officers recovered the gun from where defendant had dropped it. Defendant waived his Miranda rights and gave a confession at the police station, which confession he recanted at trial. On appeal, defendant contended that the aggravated unlawful use of a weapon statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6 (2002), was unconstitutional on the grounds that the statute required no culpable mental state and thereby punished innocent conduct, resulting in the contravention of the due process provisions of both the state and federal constitutions. Defendant further contended that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. On appeal, the court found that the statute, in requiring only a knowing mental state rather than criminal intent, bore a rational relationship to the statute's objective of protecting the general public and law enforcement from those who possessed loaded weapons in public places, and did not otherwise reach beyond its valid scope and purpose. Further, the evidence was not so improbable or unreasonable as to create a reasonable doubt of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of her arrest, defendant was on probation as the result of having been bound guilty of two misdemeanor driving related charges. The probation order provided that defendant was to submit to warrantless searches of among other things, her residence. The police conducted a random &quot;probation check&quot; of defendant's home and in a dresser drawer in her room, they found three used pipes, one of which contained cocaine residue. Defendant was not home at the time of the search but her teenage son consented to the search. Defendant's motion to suppress was based on the argument that the search was not based upon suspicion or evidence of illegal activity. The court reversed, holding that (1) the State failed to establish that defendant's son possessed the common authority over the dresser such that he could give consent to a search of the dresser; (2) the Fourth Amendment required all searches to be reasonable and the State failed to present any evidence on the reasonableness issue; (3) defendant had a diminished, but not extinguished, expectation of privacy in her home; and (4) reasonable suspicion of illegal activity was required to justify the search of the dresser.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) that dismissed for lack of jurisdiction his petition (submitted in the course of petitioner mother's contempt proceeding relating to child support) to modify the parties' custody arrangement to permit the father's family to exercise visitation according to the father's schedule while the father was on active military duty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father exercised regular visitation with the parties' child. When he was called to active military duty, he sought a modification of the custody order to allow his immediate family members to exercise visitation instead, arguing that the mother would otherwise prevent such contact. The appellate court held that the trial court had erred in holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petition. When 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/607(b)(1) (2000), the grandparent visitation statute, had been held unconstitutional, Illinois law returned to the common law rule that allowed a court to award visitation to family members when special circumstances were present. In harmony with the policy of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, 50 U.S.C.S. app. &sect; 501 et seq., of empowering civil courts to remove inhibitions that might interfere with a soldier's full devotion to his task, setting the father's mind at rest about his child appeared to present a special circumstance, empowering the trial court to proceed with a best interests analysis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of dismissal and remanded for additional proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) on charges of first-degree murder, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-1(a)(2) (1998), and aggravated discharge of a firearm, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.2(a)(2) (1998). Under the Truth in Sentencing Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges stemmed from a drive-by shooting in which defendant shot at and killed a father who was holding his three-year-old son. Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on felony murder, that there was insufficient evidence to support the firearm charge, that the trial court erred in not compelling the presence of a defense witness, and that &sect; 3-6-3(a)(2)(i) was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that (1) the firearms charge, which was based on the discharge of a firearm in the direction of the child and not his father, provided the appropriate predicate for the felony murder charge and the jury instruction was proper; (2) where three theories on first-degree murder were presented to the jury, which returned a general verdict, any error in instructing on felony murder was harmless; (3) the evidence was overwhelming that defendant knew the father was in the area where he shot his firearm and was sufficient to support the firearm conviction even if defendant was not specifically aware of the child's presence; (4) no error was committed regarding the defense witness; and (5) &sect; 3-6-3(a)(2)(i) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two co-defendants appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois). Following simultaneous but severed jury trials, both co-defendants were found guilty of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and aggravated battery with a firearm. Both defendants received consecutive sentences for the murder and attempted murder convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the admission of gang-related testimony and alleged a speedy trial violation, ineffective counsel, and insufficiency of the evidence. The court affirmed in part and remanded in part. Testimony by a gang crimes specialist was properly admitted because it qualified as an expert opinion; the specialist drew on a variety of sources, including talks with gang members, information from confidential informants, and contacts with outside agencies. The testimony was relevant to show the State's gang-related motive; without the gang-related evidence, the crimes would have been inexplicable. Even if the testimony were inadmissible, any error was harmless because of the overwhelming, nonhearsay evidence against the first defendant, including his identification by the surviving victim. The second defendant was not denied a speedy trial because many of the disputed delays were attributable to the defense, and the cumulative evidence was more than enough to establish the second defendant's accountability for any of the acts attributed to the first defendant. The court remanded for clarification of the extended-term sentences received by the first defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and sentences of the second defendant, and the court affirmed the convictions of the first defendant and remanded for the trial court to clarify what factors were used in imposing his extended-term sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from two orders of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) which denied his motion for discharge or conditional release from the custody of the Illinois Department of Human Services, and granted the State's motion to amend his &quot;Thiem date.&quot; Defendant was committed to the Department after being found not guilty by reason of insanity on charges of attempted murder, aggravated battery and armed violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's Thiem date was modified after he absented himself from the treatment facility for nearly four years. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in extending his Thiem date because 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-2-4(b) (2002) provided no basis for amending a Thiem date, and the State's motion, filed seven years after defendant's return to the facility, should have been denied. The resolution of defendant's claim depended upon whether a defendant's &quot;period of confinement&quot; included those period during which he had eloped or absented himself from the treatment facility without authorization. The appellate court held that the period of defendant's unauthorized absence, or elopement, from the facility did not constitute a period of commitment. Accordingly, the trial court was authorized to amend defendant's Thiem date. Doing so did not change the &quot;maximum period of commitment&quot; authorized by the statute. Defendant also argued that the State's motion should have been denied under the doctrine of laches. The appellate court noted that even if the State's delay amounted to a lack of diligence, defendant failed to show how he was prejudiced by the State's request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order granting the State's motion to amend defendant's Thiem date was affirmed, but the order establishing the date was reversed. The trial court's order denying defendant's petition for discharge or conditional release was reversed. The case was remanded with directions for the trial court the trial court to set defendant's Thiem date as October 2, 2006 and order an independent examination and conduct a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of attempted first degree murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault, and aggravated kidnapping. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) using extended-term and consecutive-sentence statutes,&nbsp;730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(2), 5-8-4(a) (1998), sentenced defendant to a total of 120 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the statutes authorizing the trial court to impose extended term and consecutive sentences, 730 Ill.

The State argued that any error made in imposing the extended-term sentences was not plain error because defendant could not show prejudice, and the sentences must be affirmed. The appellate court agreed with the State, noting that Apprendi did not apply to consecutive sentences. In addition, the evidence presented to the trial court overwhelmingly supported a finding that the crime was committed in a brutal and heinous manner, indicative of wanton cruelty. Defendant also contended &sect; 5-8-4(a) of the Unified Code of Corrections, codified at 730 ILCS 5/5-8-4(a) (1998), was unconstitutional. Since none of defendant's separate sentences exceeded the maximum sentence for each offense, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the consecutive sentences imposed pursuant to &sect; 5-8-4(a) were unconstitutional under Apprendi.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's appeal asserted several errors but the main assertion was that he was denied due process by the State refusal to grant the accomplice immunity to testify at the suppression hearing. The court agreed. The State's refusal to grant immunity for the suppression hearing was a discriminatory application of its powers that frustrated defendant's attempt to garner necessary facts that could have established defendant's standing to challenge the search. The State's actions impermissibly distorted the fact finding process, and the fact that the motion to suppress could have been renewed at trial did not cure the due process violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's order on the motion to suppress and remanded for a new hearing on the motion. The court retained jurisdiction to determine the remaining issues presented in the appeal in the event the State prevailed on the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother appealed from that portion of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) that granted respondent father's request for a change of custody and transferred residential custody of the parties' child to him. The father cross-appealed from that part of the judgment that denied his petition to terminate unallocated family support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and mother had joint legal custody, but the child resided with her mother. The father sought a change in residential custody based on the mother's persistent efforts to interfere with the child's relationship with him. The trial court appointed a child representative pursuant to 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/506(a) (2000) to make recommendations and, based in part on those recommendations, the trial court transferred custody. The appellate court deferred to the trial court's determination that the father had failed to establish that a condition subsequent entitling him to stop paying family support to the mother had occurred. On appeal, the mother argued that the application of &sect; 506(a) violated her procedural due process rights, because she did not have an opportunity to challenge the child representative's recommendations. The appellate court held that on the contrary, if the representative relied on any evidence not presented at trial and thereby subjected to cross-examination, the mother could request that acceptance of recommendations be conditioned on full disclosure of sources, so that they could be questioned at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted and denied various parts of the mother's motion to strike certain matters in one of the father's briefs, denied the father's motion to dismiss the mother's appeal, and proceeded to affirm the trial court's judgment on the main issues of custody and family support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) found defendant guilty of the six weapons charges in the information and, because defendant had a felony record, sentenced him to a mandatory Class X term of seven years' imprisonment on one of them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (UUW) statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6 (2000), was unconstitutional because it violated the proportionate penalty provision of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Defendant argued that aggravated UUW and misdemeanor UUW were identical offenses given different sentences. The appellate court concluded that there was not disproportionality. The appellate court found aggravated UUW required a finding of at least one of seven aggravating factors, none of which were required under the misdemeanor statute; thus, the felony charge applied to more serious conduct. Defendant also contended that the aggravated UUW provision he was convicted of violated substantive due process. The appellate court found that the purpose of the aggravated UUW statute was rationally related to a legitimate goal, making communities in Illinois safer and more secure. The appellate court concluded that each of the aggravating factors was a circumstance that belied indecent conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after a bench trial conducted in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), on charges of aggravated domestic battery and aggravated battery. The charges were merged and defendant was sentenced to four years in prison. He appealed his conviction asserting that the domestic violence statute, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3.2(a), 3.3(a) (2000), was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his victim had both been drinking when they were involved in a dispute wherein the victim smashed the windshield of defendant's vehicle and defendant then &quot;ran over&quot; the victim. Testimony from both defendant and his victim indicated that they had been in a dating relationship for at least one year prior to the incident and that the couple intended on living together after defendant's release. On appeal, defendant contended that the domestic battery statute was unconstitutionally vague due to the inclusion of persons in a &quot;dating or engagement relationship&quot; in its definition of &quot;family or household members.&quot; The court disagreed and affirmed. Neither 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-3.2(a) nor &sect; 12-3.3(a) dealt with First Amendment rights. Therefore, defendant only had standing to contest their constitutionality as the statutes were applied to him in his case. Defendant's own testimony established the type of &quot;dating relationship&quot; that brought defendant within the definition of a &quot;family or household member,&quot; providing defendant a reasonable opportunity to determine that his conduct was prohibited under the domestic violence statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which granted the motion of defendants, the Illinois State Treasurer, and the Director of the Unclaimed Property Division of the office of the Treasurer of the State of Illinois, to dismiss the property owner's class action complaint. The complaint asserted that 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 1025/15 (2000) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner filed his action after the State retained dividends on stock it held for the owner as abandoned property. Section 15 was part of the Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act, 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 1025/1 et seq. (2000). Under 765 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 1025/15 (2000), the State was allowed to keep income or other increments that accrued on property while in the State's possession. The State claimed a right to such income based on its &quot;escheat&quot; powers. Although the constitutionality issue was not reached by the trial court, the court reviewed the question of law de novo. The court reversed. Section 15 was not an &quot;escheat&quot; law, and the State could not rely on its escheat powers as a basis for retaining the dividends. Both the stock and dividends remained the private property of the owner. A &quot;taking&quot; occurred for Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment purposes when the Treasurer kept the dividends pursuant to &sect; 15. But, if no compensation was due, there was no constitutional violation. On the record, the issue of whether the owner was due any compensation could not be resolved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the case for determination of the issue of compensation in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. Ann. 152/101 et seq. (2000), and 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2000) to juveniles.</SPAN></P>

The registration provisions were rationally related to the critical public interest in avoiding sex offender recidivism, and although juvenile offenders fell within the notification provisions, there were appropriately stringent limitations on dissemination of information about juveniles. The juvenile also challenged the fact that a blood sample submitted upon adjudication as a sex offender could never be expunged, but the appellate court held that such an argument would be premature until the juvenile actually reached a point at which he would otherwise be eligible for expungement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On October 1, 2001, the father was served with a copy of a petition for adjudication of wardship and a summons via registered mail while in jail.

The case was continued several times until May 8, 2002. On May 3, 2002, the father filed a motion to dismiss the petition for adjudication of wardship pursuant to former 705 Ill. Comp. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the 21st Judicial Circuit, Kankakee County (Illinois). Defendant was convicted of bringing contraband into a penal institution and aiding escape. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed where he was properly convicted, under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/31A-1.1, for bringing contraband into a prison and aiding escape. Defendant, by acquiring a gun, repackaging it, and giving it to a correctional officer, played a key role in the delivery of the gun to the prison. Since the statute prohibited defendant's actions, defendant's vagueness claim failed. The statute was not unconstitutional. As to the contraband charge, the defendant's guilt was clear and convincing. The inclusion of the improper accountability instruction was harmless error. As the defendant was accountable for his accomplices' actions and their actions aided a convict's escape, defendant was also guilty of aiding the escape. The accountability instruction was properly given under that circumstance. The evidence established guilt. Defendant was not convicted in violation of the single subject rule of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d). Although 1984 Ill. Laws 1041 may have violated the single subject clause, the passage of 1986 Ill. Laws 866 remedied any constitutional infirmity. As defendant's conduct occurred in 1999, he was unaffected by the 1984 act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, who was a paraplegic, was a prisoner at a state correctional facility. The inmate alleged that he was denied transportation to and from court in a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, was denied wheelchair-accessible recreation and exercise, and was denied wheelchair access to the health care unit and library. The warden filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-619 (2000) on the ground that the inmate's claim was barred by sovereign immunity. The appellate court found that sovereign immunity barred the inmate's Title II claim. Illinois never consented to be sued in a circuit court by prisoners based on Title II violations. Almost every federal circuit court held that Title II did not constitute a valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because Congress had not identified a history and pattern of unconstitutional discrimination by the states against the disabled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assistant alleged that he was an African-American with a learning disability. He was fired from his job as a research assistant and his enrollment in a master's-degree program was terminated. He claimed race discrimination, disability discrimination, and equal protection violations. The trial court dismissed based on sovereign immunity and lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The court affirmed. While the Illinois Constitution of 1970 abolished sovereign immunity, the state legislature reinstated it with two narrow qualifications that did not apply to the assistant's case. Subject-matter jurisdiction over human rights violations similar to those asserted by the assistant was vested in the Illinois Human Rights Commission under 775 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8-111(C) (2000). As the state courts did not have jurisdiction over state discrimination claims, they had no jurisdiction over the assistant's federal claims. The fact that there was a presumption of concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts for federal civil rights violations could not overcome the specific limitation on circuit courts' jurisdiction over such matters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly imposed an extended term sentence based on his prior convictions, because: (1) the trial court did not find the existence of his prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by 730 Ill.

Ann. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (2001) was unconstitutional under Apprendi because it did not require that his prior convictions be pled in the charging instrument or proven at trial. After examining the legislative history of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-2(a) (2000), the appellate court concluded that the legislature intended to include language exempting prior convictions from the proof beyond a reasonable doubt requirement. Thus, &sect; 5-8-2(a) should have been read to include such an exception. Finally, the appellate court declined to hold 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(1) (2001) unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The package contained a handgun that was used by another inmate to shoot another correctional officer while escaping. The public act at issue, 1996 Ill.

Stat. Ann. 5/31A-1.2(c)(1), (4)(xi) (1998). Because one section of the public act concerned an amendment to a civil statute, the public act violated the single subject rule of Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the subject child was born, the mother named another as the child's father on the child's birth certificate. The father claimed the law of California, where the child was born, established the named individual as the child's father, as he must have signed a voluntary paternity declaration to appear on the birth certificate, and the trial court had to give this full faith and credit. The appellate court held there was no evidence of a declaration of paternity signed or filed with California authorities. The statutes defendant relied on were not in effect when the child was born. Under the law in effect then, an alleged father did not have to sign a declaration of paternity to be listed on a birth certificate, and the person named on the certificate could not be presumed to be the child's father. Under the circumstances, defendant was not estopped to deny the person she named on the birth certificate was the child's father, as it was not presumed he was the father, the mother consistently said the father was the child's parent, a blood test found the father's paternity was likely, and the father threatened to take custody of the child if the mother told anyone he was the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicted defendant of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6(a)(1)(3)(A) (2000), and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State failed to prove that he had knowledge that the weapon was in the vehicle. The appellate court's review revealed that the State presented sufficient evidence to establish that defendant had constructive possession of the weapon. Defendant next asserted that counsel was ineffective when he failed to call a codefendant to testify that defendant did not know that the gun was in the vehicle, and that had counsel done so the result of the proceedings would have been different. The appellate court found no prejudice as a result of such failure, since the officer's testimony tended to show defendant knew the gun was in the car; thus, defendant failed to show how counsel's strategic decision prejudiced his case. Finally, defendant contended that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/24-1.6(a)(1)(3)(A) (2000) violated state and federal substantive due process guarantees because it required only a mental state of knowing, without further requiring a culpable mental state. The appellate court concluded that &sect; 24-1.6(a)(1)(3)(A) was reasonably designed to achieve its purpose of protecting officers and the public against persons carrying loaded weapons in their vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State initiated condemnation proceedings in the 12th Judicial Circuit Court, Will County (Illinois), during which appellant property owners sold easements over the subject property. The State moved for a setoff against the condemnation award for amounts the owners received from the sale of these easements. The trial court granted the motion, and the owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners claimed the trial court had no jurisdiction to grant the State's motion, as it modified the condemnation judgment and was filed more than 30 days after that judgment. The appellate court held the State's motion was timely filed before the judgment was filed. No law showed the State's right to its requested setoff. As the State was trying to reduce the jury's award, it had the burden of proving a decrease in the land's value due to the easement sales, and did not meet this burden. Nor did it show the existence of the easements was relevant to the property's valuation. The trial court improperly granted the setoff. It was not shown that the property's value, which was the basis of the condemnation award, decreased by the amount the owners received from the sale of the easements. The plain language of 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-121 (2002) measured the owners' compensation in terms of the land's value. A rule giving the State superior rights to those of the easement purchasers described the relationship between the State and the purchasers and did not concern the relationship between the State and the owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate was convicted of murder and robbery in 1979, and he was sentenced to death. However, the state supreme court reversed the robbery conviction, vacated the death sentence, and remanded the case for resentencing. On remand, the trial court determined that although the inmate was not charged with burglary, the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to prove burglary, and the court used that as an aggravating circumstance to impose a sentence of life imprisonment, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1(a)(1) (1979) (now 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(b) (2000)). After the United States Supreme Court issued is Apprendi decision, the inmate filed a habeas corpus action, arguing that he was resentenced in violation of principals announced in Apprendi. The appellate court held that (1) because evidence of the burglary which the trial court used as an aggravating factor to sentence the inmate to life imprisonment was presented to the court as the trier of fact and proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the court did not violate Apprendi by using that information; and (2) the inmate did not meet the requirements for release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was told he could be tried and sentenced in absentia if he did not appear. The appellate court held defendant, though absent, had a right to a fair trial free from procedural defects, and 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-4.1(g) (2000), allowing him to collaterally attack his conviction, did not conflict with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 606, as the attack was a collateral proceeding, but the grant of an appeal was not required unless procedural issues implicating fundamental fairness and due process were raised. The jury's consideration of other crimes evidence was harmless. Lay witnesses could give opinions, the trial court did not have to instruct the jury not to consider defendant's absence, and the State could refer to it. Sufficient evidence supported defendant's theft by deception conviction, as he posed as an attorney, accepted money as a retainer and to bond a person out of jail, and neither performed services for nor returned the money. His sentence was not excessive, given earlier convictions. A disparity between a returned fugitive and a defendant present for trial was based on a policy decision to give trials in absentia heightened scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

Defendant next argued that he was denied his right to a fair trial when the judge removed him from the courtroom. The appellate court found no error since defendant was not removed until just prior to closing arguments and his interests were adequately represented by counsel; thus, defendant was present at all material stages. Finally, defendant argued that the use of a special interrogatory to determine the victim's age deprived him of due process and violated the doctrines of separation of powers and ex post facto application of laws.

Petitioner then filed a motion to reconsider alleging that Ill. Rev. Stat. Stat. para. 702-7(3)(a) (1985) was unconstitutional under Apprendi. After the trial court denied the motion by finding that Apprendi did not apply to juvenile transfer proceedings, petitioner appealed. The appellate court found that the statute was not unconstitutional because Apprendi applied only to statutes that were adjudicatory and not statutes, such as the one used to transfer petitioner's case, which were dispositional in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition to commit defendant pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/40 (1998) of the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/1 et seq. (1998). After defendant refused to participate in the evaluation process, the State moved to compel his submission. The motion was granted. The Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) found defendant to be a sexually violent person. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Act was unconstitutional because it was contrary to the due process standard established in Crane in that it allowed the civil commitment of a person as sexually violent without a finding that the person lacked control over his or her behavior. The appellate court found the Act constitutional as applied to defendant since the trial court made an explicit finding that defendant was not able to control his sexually violent behavior. The trial court also found sufficient evidence to support that finding. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred when it ordered him to submit to an evaluation by the department of human services. The appellate court found that plain error occurred. The appellate court concluded that defendant satisfied his burden of showing that he was prejudiced by the experts' testimony predicated upon certain tests or tools. All three experts relied, in part, on the actuarial tools to predict defendant's likelihood of reoffense. However, on the basis of the record, it was unclear whether these tools were still in the experimental stages or whether their validity had been established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court compelling defendant to submit to an evaluation was affirmed and the cause was remanded with directions to conduct a hearing to determine the admissibility of the actuarial tools and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyers complained that the paint on vehicles made by the corporation was defective in that it would delaminate and that the corporation failed to disclose that to the consuming public. The appellate court held that venue was not proper under the residence prong or the transaction prong. The facts did not support the residence prong, as the corporation did not design, manufacture, or produce its products in Madison County, and the corporation maintained no offices there. Although the corporation sold its vehicles to dealers from Madison County, those sales were conducted and completed in Michigan, and the corporation retained no ownership interest in the products after they had been sold. Additionally, the circuit court erred in ruling that venue was proper under the transaction prong of the venue statute,&nbsp;735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-101 (2000). The cause of action did not spring into existence in Madison County, nor did some part of the transaction in which the cause of action arose occur in Madison County. Nor did the buyers' purchasing the cars in Madison County or the paint allegedly delaminating in Madison County sufficiently constitute some part of the transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a result of the brutality of the murder committed by defendant, he was sentenced to 100 years in prison. Although first degree murder carried a sentence of 20 to 60 years in prison under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(a) (1998), a court was permitted to sentence a defendant to 60 to 100 years in prison if the offense was exceptionally brutal or heinous indicative of wanton cruelty. 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-2(a)(1), 5-5-3.2(b) (1998). Defendant claimed that his 100 year sentence was unconstitutional, because the sentence was beyond the statutory maximum, requiring the trial court to submit to the jury the question of whether the murder was exceptionally brutal. The trial court was not required to submit the exceptionally brutal question to the jury, because the maximum sentence in a first degree murder case was natural life in prison. In addition, the statute used to impose an extended-term sentence upon defendant involved a consideration of the evidence regarding the particular offense in question after he was tried on the elements of that offense. Therefore, no new evidence was considered by the trial court in sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A petitioner was convicted of aggravated battery with a firearm and armed violence based on an incident in which he shot the victim with a handgun and robbed him of cash. At that time, armed violence with a handgun was punishable by 15 to 30 years in prison. The petitioner was sentenced under the sentencing statutes to consecutive 25-year terms of imprisonment. His convictions were affirmed on appeal and his petition for leave to appeal to the state supreme court was denied. Thereafter, the state supreme court filed an opinion in another case that found the law that enacted amendments to the sentencing provisions for armed violence was unconstitutional because it violated the single subject rule of the Illinois Constitution. Petitioner did not file his petition for postconviction relief for approximately 16 months after the opinion in that other case had been filed. After the trial court dismissed his petition as untimely, the appellate court found that the petitioner was entitled to file his petition beyond the normal statutory time limits for doing so, as the facts did not show that the delay in filing the petition was due to his culpable negligence.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held the equal protection challenge to the statute was subject to the rational basis test as it did not infringe the right to vote but affected the manner of exercising the right. The statute's purpose was rationally related to a legitimate state goal of promoting local control of education efficiently, and its population-based distinction was not arbitrary. The statute was not special legislation contrary to Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, as it applied to all districts of the indicated size. The regional school board complied with statutory requirements, and a majority of the district's registered voters signed the petition. When the board's dismissal of the petition was reversed on appeal, the date to decide the petition's sufficiency was its filing, before dismissal, and it was sufficient as of that date. The subsequent withdrawal of signatures should not have been allowed. The regional board properly applied 105 Ill. Comp. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 407(b)(3) of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, codified at 720 Ill. Comp. Stat.

The appellate court held that the potential for increased penalties for the offense of possession with intent to deliver look-alike substances did not violate due process under the Illinois Constitution. Defendant also contended that the trial court lacked statutory authority to impose a street value fine and a trauma center fine because &sect; 5-9-1.1 of the Unified Code of Corrections, codified at 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-9-1.1 (2000), expressly referred to cannabis and controlled substances and did not mention look-alike substances. The appellate court held that the failure of &sect; 5-9-1.1 to mention look-alike substances led to the conclusion that the imposition of fines for such possession was not authorized.</SPAN></P>

The language of 30 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 350/3(l) (2000) encompassed the issuance of general obligation bonds to provide such a revenue source for the alternate bonds. The use of the general obligation bonds to provide a revenue source for the alternate bonds was specified in the enabling ordinance for each bond issue as well as authorized under the Debt Reform Act, 30 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 350/1 et seq. (2000). Because the bonds were plainly &quot;revenue sources,&quot; they were properly issued. 70 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 805/13 (1996) required a referendum only if the aggregate indebtedness exceeded 0.3 percent of the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the district. The indebtedness did not exceed that value.</SPAN></P>

At the hearing the father's attorney requested a continuance. The request was denied. The Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) entered an order terminating respondents' parental rights. Respondents' appeals were consolidated for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court's failure to grant his motion for a continuance jeopardized his right to a fair trial and his ability to defend against the State's allegations. The appellate court concluded that since the father failed to demonstrate how he could have undermined the overwhelming evidence demonstrating a lack of reasonable interest in the child, the trial court properly found that he was unfit under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(m) (2000). The mother argued that 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 50/1(D)(t) (2000), the statutory provision under which she was adjudicated unfit, was unconstitutional because it did not necessitate that the unfitness finding be by clear and convincing evidence. The appellate court noted that the fact that the mother gave birth to a child with drugs in his body who was subsequently adjudicated neglected marked the staring point of determining if the mother was unfit. The appellate court found that the State was required to prove that the mother failed to take advantage of drug treatment by clear and convincing evidence; thus, the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The allegedly mentally ill person was charged with first-degree murder. However, she was found unfit to stand trial. She was admitted to a mental health facility. The State petitioned for the involuntary administration of psychotropic medication.

The trial court then told her that her choices regarding representation were to accept her appointed attorney's continued representation or to represent herself. She chose to represent herself. The trial court made only a minimal inquiry into whether she had the capacity to waive her right to counsel. The trial court then heard evidence and found her to be a person subject to the involuntary administration of psychotropic medication. After she appealed, the appellate court found that the appeal was moot since she had been found fit to stand trial. It also found that the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code, 405 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/1-101 et seq., applied to her case, and that the trial court erred in not adequately inquiring into whether she had the capacity to waive her right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

The firefighters' union appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A firefighters' union and a town disagreed on a proposal to eliminate the town's residency requirement that all municipal employees live within its boundaries. Eventually, the firefighters' union invoked its right to arbitrate that issue and made a last proposal that outlined specific residency boundaries beyond the town's boundaries. The arbitrator conducted evidentiary hearings and considered the eight interest arbitration factors set forth in 5 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 315/14(h). It then adopted the firefighters' union's last proposal. The town rejected the award. The arbitrator reaffirmed it. The town petitioned for review. The trial court vacated the arbitral award and remanded the case. After the firefighters' union appealed, the appellate court found the arbitrator had the authority to hear the dispute because the residency issue was a mandatory collective bargaining subject. It also found that the relevant factors allowed the arbitrator to consider the firefighters' &quot;liberty interests&quot; implicated by the residency requirement, that the arbitrator considered the mandatory arbitration factors, and that the law containing the arbitration factors was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision vacating and remanding the arbitral award in the firefighters' union's favor was reversed, and the arbitral opinion and award were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff auto manufacturer appealed from a judgment on administrative review by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that upheld a decision of defendant Illinois Motor Vehicle Review Board that the manufacturer terminated its dealership agreement with defendant dealer without good cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agreement between the manufacturer and the dealer predated the enactment of the amended version of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Franchise Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 710/1 et seq. (2000), which applied specific standards to dealership agreements in determining whether such agreements were fairly administered and properly protected dealers in Illinois. Because the mediation provision in the dealership agreement provided far less protection to the dealer than the Act did, the appellate court looked to whether the standards could be applied retroactively. Since the standards in question had already been determined by the highest court of Illinois not to be applicable retroactively, the appellate court endorsed the decision of the motor vehicle review agency to look instead to whether good cause existed for the termination under a standard of commercial reasonableness, since a good cause standard had applied under pre-existing law, and the powers ordinarily delegated to Illinois agencies included the power to make determinations of that type.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), found that respondent mother was an unfit parent for failing to protect her son from certain abuse.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A four-year-old boy had several bruises on his face, multiple cuts and bruises on his arm, and various scratches on his back. Also, his scrotum was abnormally swollen. That injury was caused by repetitive blunt blows to the scrotum. The State petitioned to terminate the mother's parental rights and alleged she failed to protect her son from her abusive boyfriend. The trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that the mother was an unfit parent. At a hearing to determine whether termination was in the child's best interests, the mother testified she had been physically abused as a child. However, she completed domestic violence and parenting classes, and participated in therapy. One social worker testified that it would be in the child's best interests to terminate, but several other social workers disagreed with that conclusion. The trial court granted the State's petition to terminate. After that judgment was entered, the appellate court found that a preponderance of the evidence standard applied to the best interest of the child decision, and application of that standard showed the trial court's decision to terminate was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to 120 years' imprisonment based on extended terms and consecutive sentences. The matter was appealed and remanded for a new sentencing determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim tried to buy drugs from defendant but only had a small amount of money. Defendant took the money and indicated that they could smoke the drugs together. However, upon reaching a wooded area, defendant grabbed her, punched her, and sexually assaulted her. She passed out continuously from the pain and after threatening to kill her and impaling her with a tree limb, defendant left. The trial court held a hearing on aggravating and mitigating factors and then imposed the consecutive and extended term sentence based on 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(2) and 5-8-4(a) (West 1999, 1998) and on its finding that the crime was exceptionally brutal and heinous. On appeal, the matter was originally affirmed but was remanded by a higher court for resentencing in view of case precedent. The court determined that the extended term sentences had to be vacated because the enhancing elements for those sentences were not specified in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, there was no such requirement imposed on consecutive sentences and those were found to be constitutionally imposed pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-4(a) (West 1998).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the consecutive sentences, but reversed and remanded that part of the sentencing order which imposed extended terms on the charges of attempted first degree murder and aggravated criminal sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The biological mother's two minor children were found living in filthy conditions. The State alleged the children were neglected, and the biological mother so stipulated. The minors were made wards of the court. Over the next four years, social workers attempted to work with her on a plan that would result in the ultimate goal of reunification. For example, the trial court ordered therapy sessions for her in an attempt to reunify her with the minor children and allow them to return home. The effort at returning them to her home failed and it became apparent that reunification was not in their best interests. The minors were placed with foster parents. Therapists later testified that it would be in the best interests of the minors to receive permanent placements. The trial court reset the permanency goal to guardianship. It then terminated the wardship, appointed the foster parents to be the minors' guardians, and closed the juvenile case of the minors. After it ruled, the appellate court found that it had jurisdiction over the case because the trial court's judgment was a final, appealable order. It also found the judgment was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) that convicted him on jury verdict of first-degree murder and a related charge. On appeal, he argued that his confession should have been suppressed, that voir dire should have been reopened, that a truth-in-sentencing statute,&nbsp;730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-6-3(a)(2)(i) (West 2000), was unconstitutional, and that the trial court relied on improper sentencing factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several different witnesses described the circumstances surrounding defendant's confession to commission of a gang-related drive-by shooting. The judge at the hearing on the motion to suppress found the law enforcement witnesses more credible than defendant, and the appellate court found that the determination that defendant's statement was made voluntarily was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The fact that one juror had to be excused after expressing fears of gang reprisals did not oblige the trial court to reopen voir dire to determine whether other jurors were frightened, in the absence of any other evidence indicating a problem. The truth-in-sentencing statute did not violate due process or equal protection guarantees when it made persons convicted of first-degree murder ineligible for early release, because all first-degree murderers were treated equally and the law reasonably related to the State interest in discouraging murders. Finally, although defendant failed to preserve an alleged abuse of discretion in sentencing, the appellate court found no error in the trial court's consideration of nonstatutory factors in addition to required sentencing factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was before the instant court on remand from the Supreme Court of Illinois, which directed the instant court to vacate and reconsider its initial opinion that vacated defendant's sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. Defendant had been convicted of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim intentionally smashed his car into defendant's car. Defendant took a jack from the trunk of his car and hit the victim over the head with it several times, killing the victim. The trial court refused defendant's request for a jury instruction on second degree murder. Because the judge found that the murder was brutal and heinous, he sentenced defendant to an extended term of 90 years in prison. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request for a second degree murder instruction. A second degree murder charge was not warranted, as defendant's brutal murder of the victim was disproportionate to the victim's provocation. Defendant's extended prison term that was imposed under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(2), 5-8-2(a)(1) (West 1996) was unconstitutional. The jury's verdict authorized the trial court to sentence defendant to a term of 20 to 60 years, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(a) (West 1996). The trial judge's imposition of an extended sentence based on the judge's findings unconstitutionally deprived defendant of the right to a jury determination of fact crucial for setting the range of appropriate sentences.</SPAN></P>

The chemist did not test the substances in the other packets, but wrote on his report that they contained &quot;plant material.&quot; When this error was discovered, the chemist amended his report. The appellate court held that (1) the evidence showed that the police took reasonable protective measures to ensure that the evidence recovered by the officer was the same evidence that was delivered to the chemist, and the chemist's mistake went to the weight of his testimony, not its admissibility; and (2) the trial court did not violate defendant's right to trial by jury by imposing an extended sentence on defendant, based on defendant's prior convictions, without asking a jury to find that defendant had prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of three counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, and one of aggravated battery with a firearm based on accountability. The Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) imposed a mandatory sentence of natural life under the multiple-murder provision of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections, codified at 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(c)(ii) (West 2000). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his mandatory sentence of natural life based upon accountability offended the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Defendant argued that, when a mandatory life sentence was imposed for a conviction based upon accountability, no one assessed the seriousness of the defendant's conduct at any stage, at trial or at sentencing, because intent to promote &quot;any offense&quot; was sufficient for accountability. Defendant asserted that satisfying the proportionality requirement necessarily required that some human being, at some stage in the process, judge the seriousness of what the defendant did, and the likelihood of restoring him to useful citizenship. The appellate court rejected defendant's contention that the constitution was violated because the seriousness of his conduct and his rehabilitative potential were never considered during sentencing. The appellate court noted that defendant was deemed guilty as a perpetrator of the ultimate offenses since, under the common-design rule, all participants were legally accountable for the concerted acts of all participants.</SPAN></P>

At issue was the constitutionality of &sect; 75(a)(6) ( 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 446/75(a)(6) (West 2000)) of the Private Detective, Private Alarm, Private Security, and Locksmith Act of 1993.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The investigator, who was licensed in Iowa and worked as a insurance claims representative, sought licensure in Illinois. The application was denied based on the investigator's failure to meet the work experience requirement of &sect; 75(a)(6). The investigator appealed, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 75(a)(6), and the trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the Department did not err. The court first noted that although the investigator had forfeited his constitutional challenge by not raising it before the agency, it would relax the forfeiture requirement in the interests of justice. Section 75(a)(6) was constitutional under the &quot;apprentice test&quot; because there was no monopolistic right to instruct where there were alternatives to the work experience requirement and because the statute was calculated to enhance expertise. There was no due process violation because the experience requirement was a reasonable means of achieving the legislative goal of protecting the public. Finally, there was no equal protection violation because the legislature's classification regarding the types of qualifying investigative experience had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), granted defendant state industrial commission's motion to dismiss the first count of plaintiff alleged employers' declaratory judgment action alleging two statutes were unconstitutional. It also granted the state industrial commission's cross-motion for summary judgment on the alleged employers' second count contention that it took ultra vires actions. The alleged employers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state industrial commission issued notices of noncompliance to the alleged employers and argued they were &quot;employers&quot; at six separate locations. It also argued that the alleged employers, as employers, had failed to comply with the insurance coverage requirements of the Workers' Compensation Act, 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 305/1 et seq. (West 2000). It ultimately dismissed its allegations against them after finding they did not meet the statutory definition of &quot;employer.&quot; After they were dismissed, they filed a second amended complaint against the state industrial commission. They sought a declaratory judgment that certain sections of the Act and the Workers' Occupational Diseases Act, 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 310/1 et seq. (West 2000), were unconstitutional. They also claimed that certain actions taken by the state industrial commission were ultra vires. After the trial court dismissed the declaratory claim and granted summary judgment to the state industrial commission on the ultra vires claim, the appellate court found that declaratory claim was moot and the public interest exception did not apply, and that a viable ultra vires claim was not shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court for the 14th Judicial Circuit, Rock Island County (Illinois), which, on remand, sentenced defendant to a 20-year term of imprisonment for armed violence. The sentence was to run consecutively to defendant's sentences for other crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally sentenced to 25 years in prison on the armed violence charge. The sentence was to be served consecutively to sentences defendant received for violating probation. The trial court found that the nature of the offenses and defendant's character warranted that consecutive sentences be imposed to protect the public. The sentence was remanded for resentencing, because defendant was sentenced under an unconstitutional sentencing statute. On appeal of the second sentence, defendant argued that the trial court was required to make a new finding that the public's protection required consecutive sentences. The trial court failed to articulate a sufficient rationale for the imposition of consecutive sentences. A general statement of the evidence that the trial court considered in imposing the sentence was inadequate to show that the trial court made the finding based upon its conclusion that consecutive sentences were needed to protect the public, as was required under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-4(b) (West 2000). The record of the second hearing failed to set forth a clear basis for the trial court's belief that consecutive sentences were warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was modified so that the sentence for armed violence was to run concurrently with defendant's other sentences. The cause was remanded to the trial court to correct the mittimus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tenth Judicial Circuit Court, Tazewell County (Illinois), entered a judgment that summarily dismissed petitioner convicted criminal's petition for postconviction relief as frivolous and patently without merit after the convicted criminal pled guilty to unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. The convicted criminal appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged the convicted criminal with unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. He decided to plead guilty. In the factual basis for the plea, the State asserted that an undercover police officer had arranged to purchase cocaine from him. The officer later met him. He handed the officer a bag. The officer handed him a specific sum of money. The substance in the bag was later analyzed and found to be cocaine. The trial court accepted his guilty plea. The convicted criminal asserted in his postconviction relief petition that he had been entrapped into committing the offense. He argued in support that he had no prior criminal record, he was not predisposed to committing the offense, and that an informant had approached him more than 15 times before he agreed to make the sale. He also alleged his counsel was ineffective for neither investigating nor informing him of potential defenses, including entrapment. After the trial court dismissed the petition as frivolous and patently without merit, the appellate court found he alleged the gist of a constitutional claim that his plea was involuntary because his counsel was ineffective in failing to advise him on entrapment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff neighbors of defendant firearm range operator appealed from two judgments of the Fulton County Circuit Court (Illinois), one upholding the issuance of a conditional use permit for the firearm range by defendant zoning board and the other--a partial summary judgment--denying an injunction sought by the neighbors against the operation of the firearm range.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court, as had the trial court, reviewed the zoning board's decision under the deferential standard prescribed by 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-110 (West 2000), under which the grant of a conditional use variance would be upheld if the findings on which it was based were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Since there was plenty of evidence that the board considered neighboring landowners' interests as well as the welfare of the community as a whole in reaching its decision, the permit was upheld. The injunctive relief sought by the neighbors was unavailable to them because 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 130/5(c) (West 2000) precluded them from bringing any action in trespass or nuisance, based solely on noise concerns, against an owner or operator of a lawful firearm range. This protection extended to actions seeking injunctive relief. The statutory protection did not violate the certain remedy guarantee of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, because an owner or operator could be held liable on other grounds, or the special legislation prohibition of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, because it bore a rational basis to a policy of protecting such activity in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both judgments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial, petitioner was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. At sentencing, he and the State stipulated that he had prior federal court drug convictions. The trial court sentenced him to 40 years in prison pursuant to an Illinois statute allowing for an enhanced sentence for conviction on a second or subsequent drug offense. His conviction and sentence were then affirmed on direct appeal. He later filed a post-conviction petition alleging that his enhanced sentence violated his constitutional rights under Apprendi. The trial court summarily dismissed the petition, concluding that the sentence fell within the recidivist exception to the Apprendi rule. After that judgment was entered, the appellate court found his sentence was proper since the prior convictions used to enhance his sentence involved a narrow exception to the general rule in Apprendi because procedural safeguards were present when those prior convictions were obtained. It also found that since the sentencing law dealt with enhancements and not the offense itself, the State was not required to present the prior convictions to a jury.</SPAN></P>

About eight years after his conviction, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled in another case that the ultimate decision on whether to tender a lesser-included offense instruction belonged to a defendant.

More than five years later, defendant filed an amended postconviction petition claiming the Illinois Supreme Court ruling applied to his case. The trial court dismissed his petition without an evidentiary hearing. In so doing, the trial court noted that he presided over the murder trial and would not have given an involuntary manslaughter instruction in any event. After defendant appealed, the appellate court found the petition was barred by the longest applicable limitations period and defendant could not show the delay in filing was not due to his culpable negligence. It also found that the Illinois Supreme Court ruling was not of constitutional dimension and could not be applied retroactively, and that he was not prejudiced since the trial court would not have given a lesser-included offense instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An office was broken into, and a laptop computer and digital camera were missing. The back door was unlocked. A rear window was broken. The store manager where the camera was purchased was told about the theft. A day later, defendant went into the store and asked how to connect a particular model of digital camera to a computer. He later called the store and discovered it had a battery charger for the same model of camera. Defendant's girlfriend went to the store to try and buy a battery charger, and told police there that the stolen items were at his residence. Defendant was arrested as he tried to sneak out of his house. He showed police were the stolen items were located. He then informed police that a man had sold him the items the same day as the theft, but had refused to give defendant a receipt. After he was convicted of theft by receiving stolen property pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/16-1(a)(4)(A) (West 2000), the appellate court found the statute's language for showing a violation that a person received property &quot;under such circumstances as would reasonably induce him to believe that the property was stolen,&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

In 1993, defendant filed a petition seeking postconviction relief. However, a trial court dismissed the petition as frivolous, and that judgment was affirmed of appeal. In 2001, defendant filed a motion to vacate unconstitutional and void judgments, alleging that his sentence violated the United States Supreme Court's Apprendi decision. The trial court which heard defendant's motion dismissed it and, on appeal, defendant argued that his motion was in substance a postconviction petition and that the trial court erred by considering the State's arguments before deciding whether the petition was frivolous. The appellate court held that (1) because defendant's motion did not indicate defendant was seeking relief under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq. (West 2000), the trial court was not required to treat the motion as a postconviction petition; and (2) the trial court did not err by considering input from the State before ruling on defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA), appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois), which dismissed its complaint against defendant oil companies, seeking a declaration pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-701(a) (West 2000) that the companies violated the terms of gas station operating agreements, and further seeking contribution for cleanup costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ISTHA and the companies had agreements that allowed the companies to operate highway rest stop gas stations, for which there were underground petroleum storage tanks, pipe systems, and fuel dispensers. The ISTHA alleged that the companies caused spillage and leakage of petroleum products and that costly cleanups were required. The trial court granted the companies' motion to dismiss the complaint, and on appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that the fact that the ISTHA had potential alternative remedies through a breach of contract action did not preclude seeking a declaratory judgment. It was error to dismiss the complaint on that basis, as the wording of the Act clearly indicated that a declaratory judgment action was an alternative and acceptable procedure to pursue. The court also found that the ISTHA stated a claim for contribution, holding that there was no requirement that a claim be filed against it prior to seeking contribution, pursuant to the Illinois Joint Tortfeasor Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 100/1 et seq. (West 2000), and that it alleged continuing violations of the Environmental Act, 415 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12(a), (d), 5/21(a), (e) (West 2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court order and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee injured party sued, inter alia, appellant transportation district in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for personal injuries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party was removed, in Illinois, in an inebriated state from a train operated by the transportation district, and fell from the train platform. The appellate court held the principle of comity required the courts of Illinois to give effect to the laws of Indiana. One of those laws provided that the State of Indiana, and its agents, were immune from suit outside the courts of Indiana. The transportation district was undisputedly an Indiana state agency protected by this law. It was consistent with the policies of Illinois to honor Indiana's sovereign immunity, under the circumstances of the case. This was not inconsistent with the provisions of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, providing that every person was to find a remedy for all injuries and wrongs. This did not provide the injured party with a constitutional right to a remedy for injuries occurring in Illinois but merely expressed a philosophy. This aspirational goal was not violated by restricting the remedies available to the injured party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court of the 14th Judicial Circuit, Rock Island County (Illinois) to first degree murder and was sentenced to an extended prison term. On appeal, the court held that the extended portion of defendant's sentence was unconstitutional. However, the appellate court was ordered to vacate and reconsider its judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that extension of his sentence, based on the brutal or heinous element of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b)(2) (1991), was a violation. The appellate court noted that at the time of defendant's sentencing hearing, the greatest punishment the judge could impose under that statute was 60 years in prison. Thus, the prescribed statutory maximum penalty for first degree murder was a 60-year prison term. Furthermore, the magnitude of defendant's claim warranted overriding the waiver rule, and defendant's guilty plea also effected a waiver. Additionally, because para. 1005-5-3.2(b)(2) was valid under at least one circumstance, the void ab initio doctrine did not qualify as a waiver exception. As defendant only pleaded guilty to the offense with which he was charged, ordinary first degree murder, it was thus fundamentally unfair to sentence him for a more severe offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the circuit court's judgment extending defendant's prison term was vacated, and his sentence was modified to 60 years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court continued the children's cases for permanency hearings, under 705 Ill. Comp. Stat.

All rights and obligations set forth in the trial court's permanency order had to remain open for reexamination and possible revision until the permanency goal was achieved. A &quot;final judgment,&quot; for purposes of appellate jurisdiction, absolutely fixed the rights of the parties. The State's appeal from the denial of the termination petitions &quot;jumped the gun&quot; on the next review of the children's permanency goal, and the appellate court lacked jurisdiction under Ill.

The State filed its petition for defendant's commitment two months prior to his trial on two counts of sexual assault and two counts of sexual abuse. Defendant asserted that Illinois Sexually Dangerous Persons Act was unconstitutional, that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was a sexually dangerous person, and that the State improperly sought civil commitment instead of proceeding to trial. The court vacated and remanded, but found the statute to be constitutional. The court held that the statute was narrowly tailored to meet the State's two goals of ensuring the safety of the public from sexual assaults, and providing care and treatment to the mentally disordered. The court held that the State failed to meet its burden of proof that defendant was a sexually dangerous person. The court noted that although defendant was diagnosed as a pedophile that diagnosis alone did not imply that defendant had serious difficulty controlling his behavior, and the State failed to provide such evidence.

App. Ct. 1st Dist., 2000)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;On reconsideration of appellate court's prior decision, trial court's judgment was affirmed.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of, inter alia, first degree murder. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to an extended term of 90 years' imprisonment for the murder conviction. The convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. Thereafter, defendant filed a pro se post-conviction petition, which the trial court denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that her extended term sentence was unconstitutional as a violation of Apprendi. Apprendi was decided after defendant's direct appeal and after the denial of her post-conviction petition. The appellate court held that, generally, decisions which announced &quot;new rules&quot; were not applied retroactively to cases pending on collateral review. However, a new rule should have been applied retroactively if it required procedures that were implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. The gravity of an Apprendi violation was within this window of retroactivity. Thus, Apprendi applied to a timely filed post-conviction petition. Defendant did not forfeit her right to review of her extended sentence since Apprendi was decided after the trial court denied her post-conviction petition. However, the trial court, before sentence was imposed, found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was eligible for the death penalty, so her sentence of 90 years was not beyond the maximum. The jury's guilty verdict was a finding that the murdered victim of the robbery was over 60, which was sufficient to permit the trial judge to sentence defendant to an extended term.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), denied petitioner convicted killer's petition for postconviction relief after the trial court convicted the convicted killer on one-count of first-degree murder involving a drive-by shooting, and the conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Defendant appealed the denial of his petition for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convicted killer was charged with first-degree murder. After a trial, he was convicted. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. The convicted killer then filed an initial petition with an explanation that he was doing so in order to meet an approaching deadline. The record did not make clear whether the trial court implicitly denied the amended petition that was subsequently filed or simply refused to address it. However, the record did clearly indicate that the trial court only considered the initial petition because the trial court did not refer to exculpatory evidence referenced in the amended petition. The trial court then denied the petition. After the convicted killer appealed, the appellate court found the trial court erred in denying the petition because the amended petition alleged the gist of constitutional claims. Indeed, its allegations indicated that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance when defense counsel did not call at trial two witnesses who could have provided exculpatory testimony and did not allow the convicted killer to testify even though he told defense counsel that he wanted to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff customer of defendant automobile manufacturer appealed from orders of the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) dismissing his complaint alleging violations of various Illinois and federal consumer statutes, denying his motion to amend his complaint, and denying his motion to set dates for proceedings relating to his petition for attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer's car had defective sensors. The manufacturer repaired them, but not until after the customer had filed suit. The appellate court held that since the customer had been forced to sue, and could therefore be said to have been a prevailing party for purposes of recovery of attorney fees, and since certain refund offers made by the manufacturer did not appear to have made the customer whole, he could still make out a cognizable claim for damages and fees against the manufacturer. It was clear from the language of an order of the trial court dismissing the customer's claim, purportedly with prejudice, that the trial court had not intended that the dismissal in fact be final. Therefore, before the dismissal of his action would be final and reviewable, the customer would have to amend his complaint again, at which point he might well avoid dismissal. Failure of the dismissal order to include Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 304(a) language making it appealable also precluded review, since the petition for attorney fees was still pending. Finally, the court held that eventual consideration of the customer's claims would not be precluded by either res judicata or the law of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, as premature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), entered a supplemental order in petitioner ordinance violator's case that contained specific findings that respondent village's municipal parking and vehicle condition ordinance violated neither the United States nor Illinois Constitutions and, further, that it complied with Illinois statutory law regarding the availability of a hearing to contest violations. The ordinance violator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance violator was issued tickets for various violations of a village parking ordinance. The ordinance violator requested a hearing. At the hearing, he objected to the ordinance and the hearing process as violating the Due Process Clause of the Illinois and United States Constitutions. His objection was that the violation notice required to be given to an ordinance violator stated that if a person wanted to contest his ticket and was found liable, the person could expect a higher fine than the ticket's face amount. His objection was denied. A finding of liable was entered and upheld. The trial court not only upheld that ruling, but specifically found the ordinance did not violate the state or federal due process clauses and that it did not violate 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-208.3 authorizing municipalities to adopt a civil penalty system for traffic violations. After that ruling was entered, the appellate court found the ordinance violated his state and federal due process rights by subjecting him to a fine if he exercised his right to appeal. It also found the whole ordinance had to be invalidated since the notice provision was not severable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment upholding the ordinance and finding it complied with Illinois statutory law was reversed after the appellate court ruled that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company filed a 15-count complaint against defendant partner. The partner made an election to buy the interests of third-party defendant doctor in certain jointly owned companies. The partner filed a petition to stay all counts against him. The Circuit Court of McHenry County, Illinois, denied the partner's petition. The partner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The partner and the doctor were both practicing radiologists, and were business partners in two diagnostic imaging centers, facilities that performed magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs), mammograms, ultrasounds, bone marrow density tests, and other diagnostic tests. After the 15-count complaint was filed against the partner, he brought a third-party action against the doctor, seeking contribution or indemnification against the claims. Believing that the partner wrongfully obtained money from the jointly owned companies, the doctor filed a six-count counterclaim against the partner. The partner argued that 805 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 12.56(f) (West 2001) mandated a stay of all of the doctor's claims and that the trial court had no authority to deny his petition. The appellate court held that 805 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 12.56(f) did not mandate a stay but provided that a court could grant a stay in its discretion. Contrary to the partner's contention, while the word &quot;shall&quot; ordinarily indicated a mandatory legislative intent, it could be construed as permissive or directive. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the partner's petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois) convicted defendant of aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated kidnapping, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-3.1(a), 5/10-2(a)(5) (West 2000). The court denied his posttrial motion, sentenced him as a habitual criminal under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that a man came up behind her, put a knife to her throat, and told her to get into his truck. The appellate court found that because the evidence of the other crime (he previously sexually assaulted a woman) was admitted but was not sufficiently similar to establish modus operandi, its admission under that exception was error. The two crimes were not so distinctive as to &quot;earmark&quot; them as the work of a single individual. The fact the victim of the other crime was assaulted while the victim in the charged crime was unharmed was a substantial dissimilarity. Moreover, the manner in which the perpetrator approached the victims, treated the victims during the crimes, and released the victims was different. Additionally, most of the similarities were general in nature, i.e., using a knife to force an individual who was walking alone into a vehicle. The dissimilarities destroyed the effect of the similarities. However, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as the evidence was not closely balanced. The victim identified defendant in a photographic lineup, an in-person lineup, and in court, and gave a detailed description of the truck.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that defense counsel failed to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d), that the trial court failed to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 605(b), and that defendant's plea was not knowing and voluntary because the trial court failed to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402. As to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d), the appellate court noted that compliance was not achieved and the appropriate remedy was remand for a new hearing. As for Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 605(b), the appellate court found that the trial court violated Rule 605 in failing to articulate the procedural steps required for defendant to appeal. Thus, defense counsel's failure to file a notice of appeal without filing a motion to withdraw defendant's guilty plea did not constitute waiver. Finally, as for Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402, the appellate court noted that during the plea of guilty the trial court failed to admonish defendant that he was eligible for consecutive sentences. Defense counsel failed to allege said error; however, the appellate court noted that the trial court's failure constituted plain error. In considering the error, the appellate court found that defendant's plea was rendered involuntary by the trial court's failure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence and plea were vacated. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff securities broker sued defendants, Illinois Department of Revenue and others, seeking the return of money paid for gains on state bonds. The complaint also alleged that certain provisions in 1996 Ill. Laws 460 were unconstitutional and void. The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Law Division, Tax and Miscellaneous Remedies Section, granted the Department's motion to dismiss. The broker appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the broker argued that its complaint was not moot because the Illinois Protest Act provided for judicial determination of the correctness of tax claims, independent of the Department's decision not to assess the tax. The Department argued that the broker's relief under the Act was limited to a determination of the proper disposition of the money in the protest fund, and because the Department had agreed to return the money, the complaint was moot. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the appellate court concluded that the complaint was moot because there was no longer an actual case or controversy existing between the parties. The appellate court noted that the parties had agreed on the disposition of the money; thus there was no question to be decided by the court. The broker also argued that the circuit court should have applied the public interest exception. The appellate court found no compelling reason to apply the exception, noting that due to the enactment of 1996 Ill. Laws 460, the questions would not likely recur.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) granting defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment that charged him with four counts of bribery in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33-1(a) (West 2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an attorney. Defendant was accused of giving the deputy circuit clerk $ 150 if the clerk provided defendant with bond forms of those individuals arrested for the offense of driving under the influence and other traffic offenses. The clerk was not permitted to accept the money. Defendant stated that he approached the clerk to hire her to provide him with copies of bond sheets containing the names and addresses of those charged with driving under the influence. The trial court found that the bribery statute contemplated the public official's action being more than a ministerial act to which defendant was already entitled. The appellate court found that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33-1(a) (West 2000) was not unconstitutionally vague, because defendant received adequate notice of the statute's proscription. The indictment contained sufficient facts to allege bribery even if defendant paid the clerk to perform a duty that defendant was legally entitled to have performed. Defendant's claim that he lacked corrupt intent was inconsequential, because corrupt intent was not an element under &sect; 33-1(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of armed robbery. Defendant's motion for acquittal or, in the alternative, for a new trial was denied. The Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) adjudged defendant a habitual criminal under the Illinois Habitual Criminal Act, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33B-1 to 33B-3 (West 2000), and sentenced him to life imprisonment, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/33B-1(e) (West 2000). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court should have granted his motions for a directed verdict and for acquittal notwithstanding the verdict because no rational jury would have believed that the eyewitness could have identified him as the robber. In upholding the jury's verdict, the appellate court noted that there was other evidence upon which the jury could have convicted defendant, including testimony regarding his clothing, a shot gun, and a mountain bike. Defendant also argued that the trial court should have granted his motion for a new trial because he was denied a fair trial. The appellate court found that defendant suffered no prejudice as the result of testimony that defendant possessed heroin when arrested because defendant admitted that he was a user of heroin. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court erred in adjudging him a habitual offender. The appellate court found no error, noting that defendant met the requirements of the Illinois Habitual Criminal Act, thus mandating the imposition of a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), entered final judgments of conviction after it found defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and three counts of aggravated battery with a firearm. The trial court sentenced defendant for the murder and to three consecutive prison terms for each aggravated battery with a firearm conviction. Defendant appealed his consecutive sentencing for the aggravated battery with a firearm convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant fired shots at a group of people. One man died. Three other people were wounded. One victim testified she was shot in the leg. Although she did not get immediate medical attention, she later spent five or six hours at the hospital. Another victim was shot in the leg. He also did not get immediate medical attention and was released from the hospital right after his wound was cleaned. The third victim sustained a wound to her left arm requiring emergency surgery and a 19-day hospital stay. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and three counts of aggravated battery with a firearm. He was then sentenced for the murder and also given three consecutive prison terms for each aggravated battery conviction. After judgment was entered, the appellate court found that to impose consecutive sentences pursuant to the relevant sentencing statute,&nbsp;730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-4(a) (West 1996), it had to be shown that the victims sustained &quot;severe bodily injury.&quot; While it concluded that element was shown as to the victim with the 19-day hospital stay, it remanded the case for the trial court to hold a new sentencing hearing as to the other two victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consecutive sentence imposed on the aggravated battery with a firearm conviction for the victim who spent 19 days in the hospital after being shot was affirmed. The consecutive sentences imposed on those convictions regarding the other two shooting victims were vacated and the case was remanded to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing as to the sentences regarding the two shooting victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband sought a divorce. During dissolution proceedings, he removed his wife as beneficiary of his inter vivos revocable trust. The wife then petitioned for injunctive relief to compel him to restore his estate plan to its predissolution status. She alleged the parties had created separate inter vivos revocable trusts for estate planning purposes and had designated each other as trust beneficiary upon their deaths. She further alleged they agreed to have mutual wills and were not entitled to revoke the will provisions purportedly providing for each of their estates to pour over into their respective trusts upon their deaths. She also sought to restrain the husband from disposing of his property except as statutorily permitted. The trial court granted the husband's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. After judgment was entered, the appellate court found the wife was not entitled to the preliminary injunction she sought, as her allegations were insufficient to show the existence of mutual wills or a binding contract regarding revocation, a protectable right, or that he had transferred property he was not allowed to transfer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault and armed robbery after a jury trial. The convictions were affirmed on appeal. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) summarily dismissed petitioner's pro se requests for relief pursuant to the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 122-1 et seq. (West 2000), after finding the issues raised therein to be frivolous and patently without merit. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of two crimes and his request for post-conviction relief was summarily dismissed. On appeal, the court remanded with directions. The court held that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing the petition because petitioner stated a &quot;gist&quot; of a meritorious claim in arguing that he was denied a fair and impartial trial and that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise that issue on appeal. Specifically, petitioner alleged he was denied a fair trial because one of the jurors worked during the same time as petitioner at a hotel when petitioner was convicted of raping a hotel guest. Petitioner's claim was not waived for failure to raise it on direct appeal because his appellate counsel's failure to raise the issue at that time was objectively unreasonable where the record demonstrated that the juror may have possessed exceptionally prejudicial information concerning the prior conviction. As such, an evidentiary hearing should have been held. The court further held that because a gist of a claim had been found to exist, the entire petition and all of the claims therein were required to be remanded to the trial court for consideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the cause to the trial court for petitioner's claim for relief to be redocketed and advanced to the second stage for the trial court to determine whether petitioner made a substantial showing of constitutional violations. The trial court was also directed to consider the allegations raised in petitioner's second postconviction petition regarding his sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant short-term lenders sued appellee director in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for declaratory judgment as to the validity of legislation amending the Illinois Consumer Installment Loan Act, 205 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 670/1 et seq. (West 2000), and certain short-term lending rules promulgated pursuant to the amendatory legislation. The trial court granted the director's motion to dismiss. The short-term lenders appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The short-term lenders sought to declare the amendment to 205 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 670/22 (West 2000) of the Illinois Consumer Installment Loan Act, 205 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 670/1 et seq. (West 2000), unconstitutional and the rules promulgated thereunder by the Illinois Department of Financial Institutions void or, alternatively, invalid. On appeal, the court concluded that the amendment represented a valid delegation of legislative authority to the Department. Further, the amendment provided sufficiently intelligible standards to guide the Department's rulemaking discretion and, accordingly, was not impermissibly vague. Moreover, the promulgated rules were consistent with and did not transcend the scope of the Loan Act statutory scheme. Finally, the impact analysis by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs was submitted within the time constraints imposed by 5 Ill. Comp. Sta. Ann. 100/5-30(c) (West 2000). Accordingly, the amendment and the rules promulgated thereunder were valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from judgments on jury verdict of the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) convicting them (after trials before two different juries) of criminal drug conspiracy. They argued primarily that their indictment had been duplicitous and that the nonconsensual eavesdropping orders used to gather evidence were constitutional. They also challenged certain evidentiary rulings and the length of their sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested for criminal drug conspiracy in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 570/405.1 (West 2000) after a long investigation during which police gathered evidence via electronic eavesdropping pursuant to warrants obtained in accordance with 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. art. 5/108B (West 2000) as well as from pen registers that recorded numbers called from the phones they used. The appellate court held, first, that the indictment was not duplicitous. Although many acts were alleged, they were all allegedly committed in furtherance of a single conspiracy, and that conspiracy was the crime of which they were convicted. The statutory procedures, which were followed nearly to the letter, assured that the issuance of warrants for electronic surveillance did not violate the protections of the Fourth Amendment and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Pen registers were not searches within the Fourth Amendment's definition, although they were possible breaches of privacy rights protected by the state provision. Defendants lacked standing to challenge them, however, because they had no reasonable expectation of privacy in phones they did not own.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court corrected an error in the mittimus for one defendant, but otherwise affirmed the judgments in all respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), granted summary judgment to defendants, a city, a police chief, and two police officers, after plaintiff day care owner sued them alleging malicious prosecution and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims, and her spouse sought loss of consortium damages. It also denied the day care owner and spouse's motion to compel discovery of police department personnel files. The day care owner and spouse appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The day care owner operated two day care centers. A child alleged that the day care owner had sexually assaulted her. An investigation ensued. At least three other children alleged the day care owner sexually abused them. She was indicted for the aggravated criminal sexual assaults of the four children. She was tried for assaulting the first child. The jury returned a not guilty verdict. The State nol-prossed the remaining indictments. She then sued the police chief and two police officers for malicious prosecution and for violating her civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The spouse filed a loss of consortium claim. The city was also joined as a defendant. After the trial court granted the police chief, police officers, and city's summary judgment motion on all the claims, the appellate court found that they did not show the absence of any of the malicious prosecution elements or that they were entitled to immunity and, thus, the trier of fact needed to hear the case. However, it also found that denial of the day care owner's and spouse's motion to compel seeking police department personnel files was proper, as the request was an unwarranted &quot;fishing expedition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's grant of summary judgment to the city, the police chief, and the two police officers was reversed. The judgment denying the day care owner and spouse's motion to compel discovery was affirmed. Also, the case was ordered to be remanded so that it could proceed to trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on a student's charge that the choir director sexually molested her, the Department filed an &quot;indicated&quot; report of abuse. It denied the choir director's request for expungement. He requested a hearing, and the Department was ordered to give him copies of its investigative file. After the hearing, the &quot;indicated&quot; finding was upheld. The trial court reversed due to the Department's untimely production of portions of a police report. The instant court disagreed, because the choir director had not shown prejudice from his late receipt of the report, but affirmed on other grounds. The instant court held the Department could file an &quot;indicated&quot; report on the basis of &quot;credible evidence,&quot; rather than a preponderance of the evidence, without violating the choir director's right to due process. However, having done so, it was obliged to strictly comply with its statutory and regulatory deadlines for processing the administrative appeal. The Department missed the 90-day deadline to issue its decision, and the Director missed the 45-day deadline to issue his opinion. By failing to meet statutory and regulatory deadlines, the Department violated the choir director's right to due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed from his conviction of theft by the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois), after being charged with violation of a city ordinance. Defendant violated two of the conditions of his supervision for theft, was found in indirect criminal contempt, and was sentenced to 12 months of probation, 180 days of detention, eight days to be served immediately; both the contempt conviction and sentence were also appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proceedings were not conducted under the Juvenile Court Act, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/1-1 et seq. Defendant contended that &sect; 5-125, codified at 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/5-125 (West 2000), which permitted a prosecution under a city ordinance without the procedural safeguards provided for in the Act, violated his rights to equal protection and due process. The appellate court found that &sect; 5-125 was constitutional. There was a reasonable purpose for the statute, so there was no equal protection violation. Further, the juvenile received due process even though the trial court did not appoint counsel for the theft charge, as he was not imprisoned for it. Counsel was appointed for the contempt charge. The sentence for criminal contempt was not an abuse of discretion. The juvenile could avoid imprisonment for all but eight days of the sentence by obeying the trial court's probationary order that he comply with the requirements that the law and society imposed on 13-year-olds. The trial court had jurisdiction in the contempt proceedings as the juvenile had not completed his supervision for the theft. The contempt charge did not have to be filed as a separate proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sexual offender commitment laws had to require proof of a person's serious difficulty in controlling behavior. The appellate court held, though the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/1 et seq. (West 1998), did not explicitly mandate a finding as to an offender's self-control ability, the State had to prove the offender's mental disorder affecting the ability to control conduct. No other findings of an offender's inability to control conduct were required. Defendant was not discharged from the Illinois Department of Corrections until released from mandatory supervision, so the State complied with the provision in 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/15(b)(2) (West 1998) that it file a commitment petition within 90 days of his discharge by filing before the end of his incarceration for a second conviction, after mandatory supervision. Admitting hearsay an expert did not rely on in forming an opinion was harmless error, given other evidence. Not objecting to the results of a penile plethysmograph, not shown to have general scientific acceptance, did not prejudice defendant, given other evidence, so ineffective assistance of counsel was not shown.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had an ordinance that regulated the issuance of livery licenses and limited the number of licenses available. The ordinance was amended many times and ultimately the cap on licenses was lifted. Nine years after the termination of the cap, the corporation instituted an action that alleged multiple claims and the trial court dismissed each claim. On the corporation's appeal from the dismissal of its contract and estoppel claims, the court affirmed. The court first held that the corporation's action was not time-barred under 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 10/8-101 (West 2000) because that statute did not apply to contract claims. No contract was formed between the parties because the ordinance was not a unilateral offer that the corporation accepted by obtaining livery licenses. The city did not promise to limit the number of licenses issued, nor did it direct the ordinance at any particular organization. As there was no contract, it followed that there was no breach. The corporation's promissory estoppel claim was properly dismissed because the ordinance was not a promise purporting to be directed to the corporation and, further, estoppel against public bodies was extremely rare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered an open plea of guilty to two counts of first-degree murder. Following an earlier sentencing and remand, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to life in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had beaten a five-year-old child over two days, and left him alone to die. In the first appeal, defendant's sentence was vacated since the statute under which he was sentenced was unconstitutional. On remand, defendant did not move to withdraw his guilty plea. The parties stipulated to the evidence presented at the first sentencing hearing. On appeal, defendant argued that the prior decision required the trial court to conduct a full resentencing hearing. The appellate court ruled that the trial court's conduct of the resentencing hearing on remand was proper.  730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(b) provided for a discretionary, not mandatory, life imprisonment where a trial court found, inter alia, that the murder was accompanied by exceptionally brutal or heinous or wanton cruelty. The life sentence was supported by factors including, but not limited to, the unprovoked and senseless nature of the attack, the number of wounds inflicted, the extent of the injury inflicted, the prolonged nature of the offense, the conduct devoid of mercy or compassion, the amount of force used, the repeated gratuitous violence, and the mental anguish of the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a trial in absentia, the Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit, Peoria County (Illinois), found defendant, a minor, delinquent for having committed unlawful possession of a motor vehicle, in violation of 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-103(a)(1) (West 2000), and residential burglary, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/19-3(a) (West 2000). The trial court sentenced defendant in absentia.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with unlawful possession of a motor vehicle and residential burglary. The trial court appointed counsel for defendant and informed her she could be tried in absentia if she failed to appear for trial. Defendant denied the burglary charge, and the matter was set for trial on that charge. Defendant failed to appear for trial and the trial court tried defendant in absentia, and adjudicated her delinquent. The court scheduled sentencing for a later date, but defendant failed to appear for sentencing and the court sentenced her in absentia. The appellate court held that (1) the Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/1-1 et seq. (West 2000), required that minors receive, at a minimum, the same procedural rights as adults; (2) 725 Ill. Comp. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father appealed from a decision by the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) denying his motion to modify guardianship and custody of his children. In a separate appeal, the father and appellant Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) transferring guardianship of the children from DCFS to foster parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father contended that the appellate court had jurisdiction to review the order denying his motion to modify guardianship and custody pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 301, 304(a), 306(a)(5). In dismissing the appeal, the appellate court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 301 and 304, and would not entertain the appeal under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 306 because judicial economy would not be served. In the appeals from the order transferring guardianship, DCFS argued that the trial court's order was against the manifest weight of the evidence and that DCFS should have retained guardianship with the permanency goal of returning the minors to the father's home. The appellate court agreed, noting that a return to the father was in the best interests of the children at the time. In the father's appeal, he argued that the trial court should have granted him immediate guardianship and custody of the minors because, inter alia, the trial court's finding that a placement with foster parents was in the minors' best interest was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The appellate court agreed with this argument and reversed the transfer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's appeal from denial of his motion to modify guardianship was dismissed. The trial court's order transferring guardianship was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from judgments of the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) convicting him in separate proceedings of two counts each of drug possession and drug possession with intent to deliver and sentencing him, in a single proceeding, to consecutive sentences on the two pairs of counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for possession of drugs; two years later he was arrested for possession with intent to deliver. He was tried on the latter charges first, convicted on both sets of counts, and sentenced in a single proceeding, with an enhanced sentence because of his prior felony convictions, pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5-3(c)(8) (West 1998). He successfully challenged the simple possession convictions on grounds of insufficiency of evidence, because the State had simply failed to establish chain of custody at all, so there was no reason to suppose the plastic packets mentioned by the arresting officer had anything to do with the drugs identified by the State's expert. Defendant's argument that his convictions of possession with intent to deliver were causally related to counsel's ineffective assistance was meritless, however, because it was clear that any motions to quash his arrest or suppress the evidence seized would have been futile. Finally, the imposition of an enhanced sentence did not violate the Apprendi rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the convictions and sentences for possession but affirmed the convictions and sentences for possession with intent to deliver.</SPAN></P>

The trial court considered this evidence and ordered a new election. The appellate court held that (1) the United States Supreme Court's Bush decision did not require that anytime a recount was ordered and ballots were missing, a new election must be held; (2) the returns provided by election officials were prima facie evidence of the election results; (3) the errors alleged were garden variety election irregularities that did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983; and (4) the trial court erred by ordering a new election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parent filed a personal injury action against defendant Board of Education of the City of Chicago (Illinois), alleging that she was injured because the Board failed to warn her of a dangerous condition on its property and violated the Cook County (Illinois) Building Ordinance and the Chicago (Illinois) Municipal Code. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the action and the parent appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a parent was leaving a school where she had gone to register her children, she missed a step that was outside a door leading out of the school, stepped onto the ground at a level lower than the step, and fractured her ankle. The parent claimed that she fell because the step was not 10 inches wide, the placement of a desk by the door interfered with egress, the step had no handrail, and the Board failed to warn her about the danger. The Board filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the parent's lawsuit was time-barred by 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-214(b) (West 1998), the statute of repose for construction. The appellate court held that the Illinois Premises Liability Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 130/1 et seq. (West 1998), did not impose a duty on the Board to change the step as construction standards changed, the Board could rely on 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-214(b) (West 1998) to defend the parent's action, and the parent's action was time-barred under &sect; 13-214(b) because it was filed more than 10 years after the step was constructed.</SPAN></P>

Geiger, Judge, Presiding.  <BR>People v. Kastman, 309 Ill. App. 3d 516, 722 N.E.2d 1202, 2000 Ill. App. LEXIS 4, 243 Ill. Dec. 133 (Ill. App. Ct. 2d Dist., 2000)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was adjudicated a sexually dangerous person. Years later, appellant filed an application for recovery, pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 205/9 (West 1998), in the Circuit Court of Lake County (Illinois). The trial court denied the application. Appellant timely sought review following the trial court's denial of his posttrial motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the application because the psychiatrist, the warden, and the social worker who signed appellant's psychologist report believed that appellant was still sexually dangerous, and the trial court found appellant's testimony did not overcome that factor. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred when it placed the burden of proof on appellant to show that he was no longer sexually dangerous. The burden of proof belonged on the State to show beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant remained sexually dangerous. Additionally, the appellate court found that (1) the psychologist who signed the report was not required to hold a license; (2) because the psychiatrist received no remuneration for his services other than his salary and because his socio-psychiatric reports were prepared solely on behalf of the corrections department, he was exempt from the statutory licensing requirement; (3) the trial court, upon a challenge, had to ensure that the psychologist and the sociologist preparing the socio-psychiatric report were qualified to prepare the report; and (4) the Illinois Sexually Dangerous Persons Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

When the owner did not demolish the building, the village filed suit, pursuant to &sect; 11-31-1 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-31-1 (West 1996), seeking an order authorizing demolition. On appeal from a trial court's judgment authorizing demolition, the appellate court held that &sect; 11-31-1 was unconstitutional to the extent it authorized the village to demolish privately-owned buildings or to require a person or entity that owned private property to demolish a building without giving the owner the option of repairing the building within a reasonable period of time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Jersey County (Illinois) of first degree murder and four counts of armed violence. He was sentenced to a term of natural life imprisonment for the murder conviction and 30 years for each conviction for armed violence, to be served consecutively to each other and to the sentence of natural life. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defense counsel did not object to armed violence charges filed on the eve of the trial of murder and attempted murder. The appellate court held the armed violence charges were not included offenses of attempted murder as they contained elements not required for an attempted murder conviction. Under the charging-instrument approach, it did not matter if the additional elements were at issue at trial. Defense counsel was ineffective for not moving to dismiss the armed violence charges on speedy-trial grounds; since dismissal would have been granted and defendant would not have been convicted of these charges, he proved prejudice. Given the overwhelming evidence of defendant's voluntary and willful actions, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to tender a recklessness instruction along with an involuntary manslaughter instruction. The case did not hinge on defendant's mental state. The trial court's finding that defendant's behavior was exceptionally brutal and indicative of wanton cruelty had to be charged and submitted to the jury; since it was not, defendant's life sentence had to be modified to the statutory maximum for first degree murder, which was 60 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's armed violence convictions were reversed, and his life sentence was reduced to 60 years. His first degree murder conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Ann. 5/9-3(b) (West 1998), a defendant under the influence of alcohol at the time of a reckless homicide was presumed reckless unless disproved by contrary evidence. The appellate court held this provision unconstitutionally compelled the jury to find defendant was reckless and shifted the burden to him to prove otherwise. It was severable from the rest of the reckless homicide statute as it was adopted at a different time, the rest of the statute could operate without it, and it was not so intertwined with the rest of the statute that the legislature intended the statute to stand or fall as a whole. The trial court's exclusion of defendant's character evidence was harmless as his offer of proof was vague and the State had ample contradictory evidence. Defendant's requested use of charts during closing to show that subtracting 30 from 59.75 yielded 29.75 was unnecessary. His proposed instruction that excessive speed alone did not prove recklessness was correctly refused as it was misleading in that it did not convey a proper analysis of applicable law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that his guilty plea to first-degree murder was involuntary because the court admonished him that he was eligible for an extended-term sentence but the extended-term sentencing statute was later rendered unconstitutional by Apprendi. In affirming defendant's conviction, the appellate court noted that the trial court admonishment that defendant was eligible for extended-term sentences was true under the then-existing law and remained true. Thus, the appellate court concluded that defendant's argument reduced to one that, had he known that he had the right to have a jury, rather than the trial court, decide whether his conduct was brutal and heinous, he would have rejected the State's plea offer and insisted on going to trial. On that argument, the appellate court held that defendant's plea was voluntary in light of law that existed when the plea was entered into. The appellate court noted that the voluntary plea could not be invalidated by late changes in the law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant petitioned to rescind his statutory summary suspension and alleged that 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/7-4-8 (West 2000) was unconstitutional. The Circuit Court of Franklin County (Illinois) denied defendant's petition and declined to find a constitutional violation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the circuit court erred in denying his petition to rescind his statutory summary suspension. Defendant claimed that because the officer failed to log the purported test or tests in the official records of the sheriff's department, the tests were inadmissible hearsay. In affirming the circuit court's judgment, the appellate court concluded that Ind. Admin. Code tit. 77, &sect; 510.20 (1999) contained no requirement that the breath test be listed in a logbook to be accurate or trustworthy. In addition, defendant failed to show to that the test was not preformed in accordance with the regulations. Defendant also claimed that he made out a prima facie case for recission because the officer left the room during the 20-minute observation period in violation of Ind. Admin. Code tit. 778 &sect; 510.60(a)(1) (1999). The appellate court found that even if the officer left the room, he observed defendant the entire time required, though glass. Finally, defendant argued that the statutory police district was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed, noting that defendant's right as a voter was not extinguished by the legislature's creation of a police district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of telephone harassment. The Circuit Court of Cook County, Criminal Division (Illinois), sentenced defendant to two years' conditional discharge with a mental health examination, and defendant was ordered not have any unlawful contact with her former attorney. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was based on telephone contact she had with the attorney representing her in a civil action. On appeal, defendant contended that she was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because the State failed to prove that she made the telephone call for the specific purpose of making a threat. The appellate court noted first that defendant's intent should be measured at the time she placed the call to the attorney. Thus, the appellate court concluded that, based upon the totality of the surrounding circumstances, and the reasonable inferences that could be drawn therefrom, the evidence supported the finding that defendant intended to threaten the attorney at the time the call was placed. Under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 135/1-1(2) (West 2000), the court was not required to consider whether defendant's threat was reasonable, but, rather, whether her subsequent conduct was evidence of her intent at the time she placed the phone call.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow sued appellee port district, and others, in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) regarding the decedent's death after falling from the port district's dock. The trial court dismissed the widow's complaint, and she appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent worked on a dock maintained by the port district, from which he fell into a river and drowned. The appellate court held the port district was immune from liability for the fall, under 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 10/3-110 (West 2000), because its authority and responsibility did not extend to the river. It was a creature of statutes, rules and regulations which defined its operational parameters. Its responsibility did not extend beyond the maintenance of port, harbor, and water and land terminal facilities to control of the river in which the decedent drowned. The decedent was not a third party beneficiary of the license agreement between his employer and the port district, which required the port district to maintain the dock from which he fell, as that agreement made no mention of him or any longshoreman.  745 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 10/3-110 (West 2000) did not violate the Illinois Constitution's special legislation clause, as it treated all municipalities near the water in the same manner, so the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to allow the widow to amend her complaint to include that argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
