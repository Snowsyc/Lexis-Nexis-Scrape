HOLDINGS: [1]-The totality of the evidence was sufficient to allow the court to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant, who was the director of a private organization which maintained a nonprofit facility to house rescued dogs, did not provide proper care to multiple dogs because he exposed those dogs to conditions injurious to their well-being by confining them during cold weather in small cages, without bedding, in a facility that, in view of the nature of the confinement, provided inadequate heat for the size and breed of the dogs, when the dogs were exhibiting signs of imminent hypothermia; [2]-Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-247(a) was not void for vagueness, as applied to the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a(g)(3) because the state sufficiently proved his two prior DUI convictions.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-12(a) and the statute contemplates a continuing role in monitoring a juvenile's well-being who is in custody.</SPAN></P>

The jury could reasonably have found that defendant sent the letter with the intent to harass or alarm the victim and his belief regarding the validity of the 2001 conviction and the fact that there was no prohibition in place at the time were not dispositive on the issue of whether the communication was sent with the intent to harass, alarm, or annoy the victim.</SPAN></P>

Nothing in the record persuaded the appellate court the trial court's factual findings were clearly erroneous or that its application of the law to the facts was improper. In part, although he claimed that the search warrant was executed on him during the questioning by the detectives, the record was unclear; [2]-The trial court acted within its discretion in denying the two oral requests for an additional competency examination of defendant because the most recent competency report had concluded that he was competent to stand trial and that he had a sufficient understanding of the proceedings to assist his counsel at trial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 14-223, which was based on his claim that a video of the pursuit, captured by a police dashboard camera, unequivocally demonstrated that he never increased his speed, because the video did not conclusively establish the same but showed that he had made an abrupt left turn without signaling, and the jury could have concluded that he accelerated at that point; [2]-The court held that the trial court properly declined the defendant's request to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment because there was no evidence that any other member of the police department repeatedly or persistently solicited defendant to drive away from the parking lot and to refuse to pull his vehicle over when signaled to do so.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 54-102g (2003) to use reasonable force to take a DNA sample from defendant, a convicted felon, since a prosecution under &sect; 54-102g for failing to provide a DNA sample applied prospectively to conduct that occurred after his sentence had begun; [2]-Application of &sect; 54-102g to defendant based on crimes committed before its enactment did not violate his right to due process or the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, as it was a regulatory statute, not a penal one, and it was not applied retroactively; [3]-Though former &sect; 54-102g did not expressly permit the State to use reasonable force to obtain a DNA sample, the trial court properly found that not allowing the State to do so would fatally undermine the purpose of &sect; 54-102g--to maintain a DNA data bank.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury convicted defendant of conspiracy to commit identity theft in the third degree and conspiracy to commit larceny in the third degree, he pleaded guilty to the part B information charging him as a persistent serious felony offender under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-40. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut) denied his motion to withdraw his plea and sentenced defendant under &sect; 53a-40(j). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant had knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to a jury trial. The record evidenced his full awareness of the nature of the charges, including the underlying larceny and identity theft as well as the enhancements sought for each. Nothing indicated that defendant was not of ordinary intelligence and educational background, and he had experience with the criminal justice system. The trial court permitted defendant, who represented himself, to consult with standby counsel at the hearing on the motion to withdraw the plea. The plea canvass met the standards for a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver. Defendant's plea of guilty operated as a waiver of his right to a jury trial not only with respect to whether he was a persistent serious felony offender but also with respect to whether his extended incarceration was in the public interest. The trial court had failed to make an explicit finding as to the public interest factor, requiring remand. The lack of such a finding, however, did not affect the voluntariness of the plea or provide grounds for withdrawal under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 39-27.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment on the part B information. It remanded the case for the trial court to find whether extended incarceration was in the public interest or for defendant to make the appropriate acknowledgement. Depending on that finding or acknowledgement, the trial court was to determine whether an enhanced sentence was appropriate. It affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a condominium association and others, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Ansonia-Milford (Connecticut) dismissing their appeal from a decision of defendant planning and zoning commission. The condominium association claimed, inter alia, that it was denied due process when the commission received, ex parte, a revised site plan from defendant applicants following the close of the public hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants submitted an application for a planned development district to develop seven residential units on their property. The commission held hearings and conditionally voted to approve a resolution related to the application. The town planning consultant informed the commission that the staff had pointed out some geometric spacing problems to the applicants and the applicants provided a response as to how they could address those issues by removing one of the units down below bringing the number of units down to six, thereby addressing a number of other issues. The appellate court concluded that the commission received an ex parte communication from the applicants that it considered in approving the proposed district and that the court, therefore, improperly concluded that the condominium association had failed to demonstrate prejudice. The appellate court could not conclude that the commission's staff merely supplied technical information to the commission that it considered in approving the application. The information originated with the applicants. The consultant was a conduit. The association was prejudiced by the ex parte communication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded with direction to sustain the condominium association's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court in the judicial district of Tolland (Connecticut) of 24 counts of sexual assault in the third degree, in violation of Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's victim was an adult. The appellate court held an information alleging Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-72a(a)(2) violations was not dismissed due to the statute having been held unconstitutional when he was arrested, because Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. 84-3 stayed that holding until its reversal. An amendment adding a sexual assault in the first degree count did not offend separation of powers absent a probable cause finding because (1) nothing required this finding, and (2) defendant could not argue there was no probable cause after he was convicted. The State's decision to charge him, and not the victim, was not selective prosecution because (1) the State's charging decision was based on his history of controlling the victim, not his age or gender, and (2) it was no error to deny him an evidentiary hearing, as the court accepted the parties' factual representations and denied his motion to dismiss without prejudice. It was no error to admit expert testimony on delayed disclosure of sexual abuse without a Porter hearing because (1) such testimony was not scientific evidence requiring such a hearing, and (2) Connecticut had not extended Porter to other technical knowledge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Tolland, Connecticut, which denied the inmate's amended petition for writ of habeas corpus and also denied his petition for certification to appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no abuse of discretion in the denial of the certificate to appeal or in the remainder of the habeas court's judgment. The habeas court correctly determined that the inmate did not prove that his defense was prejudiced by his trial counsel's failure to advise him regarding his parole eligibility. The record supported the habeas court's factual finding that the issue of parole eligibility did not play a part in and was not the centerpiece of any plea agreement that the inmate entered into with the State. The inmate's reliance on the Hernandez decision was misplaced. Contrary to the facts in Hernandez, the inmate's trial counsel did not misadvise the inmate as to his parole eligibility. As the issue of parole eligibility did not play a part in the inmate's decision to enter into the plea agreement, the habeas court correctly determined that the petitioner's plea was not rendered unintelligent, involuntary and unknowing due to the alleged ineffective assistance of his trial counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of his motion to suppress, a jury convicted defendant of evasion of responsibility in the operation of a motor vehicle, assault of public safety personnel, and interfering with an officer. The Superior Court in the judicial district of New London, geographical area number twenty-one (Connecticut) imposed a total effective sentence of four years, suspended after 18 months, followed by three years probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, as the police entered his home without a warrant, in the absence of exigent circumstances. The appellate court found no error, noting that defendant failed to demonstrate that his conviction was tainted by any fruity of the alleged unlawful entry. The conduct underlying defendant's convictions occurred well after the time of the police entry; by the time of their commission, the police had identified themselves, announced the purpose of their presence, and emergency medical personnel had arrived. In addition, even if defendant could prevail on his claim of illegal entry, the evidence with regard to the crimes of interfering with an officer and assault of public safety personnel was admissible under the new crime exception. Defendant's challenge to the jury instructions also failed, as none of the instructions misled the jury or deprived defendant of his right to a jury trial. Finally, the appellate court concluded that defendant's conviction for assault of public safety personnel and interfering with an officer did not violate the protection against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate maintained that the amendments to &sect;&sect; 53a-54a and 29-35 were void because the enactment clause required by Conn.

He conflated the requirement of art. III, &sect; 1, with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 2-58, the statutory provision requiring publication of public acts. Art. III, &sect; 1, required that laws enacted by the legislature be prefaced by this clause: &quot;Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Assembly convened.&quot; As the actual bills passed by the legislature contained the required enactment clause, there was no constitutional infirmity due to the lack of that prefatory language in the published versions. The failure to include the enactment clause in the published public acts did not deprive the inmate of notice of the nature of the charges against him. Information as to what acts &sect;&sect; 53a-54a and 29-35 prohibited was available to the inmate by virtue of their publication under the authority of &sect; 2-58, even without the inclusion of the enactment clause in the published volumes of the public acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk (Connecticut), for various drug-related crimes, including conspiracy to distribute narcotics. Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly consolidated two separate cases against him for trial, that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278a(b) was unconstitutionally vague, and his multiple sentences for conspiracy violated double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges stemmed from two separate incidents. In the first incident, the officers used a taxicab and cellular telephone to arrange for the purchase of the narcotics from defendant, who was arrested when he approached the taxicab. The police recovered crack cocaine and cash. In the second incident, the police observed defendant conduct a drug sale. The appellate court held that a review of the transcripts revealed that the evidence was presented in a reasonably clear order, although it was not strictly chronological. When ruling on the motion for joinder, the court reasonably could have concluded that the case would not be particularly lengthy or complex. When considered as a whole, the charge presented the case to the jury so that no injustice would result. It was not reasonably possible that the charge, when read as a whole, impermissibly misled the jury to believe that it could consider all the evidence collectively when deciding each case. A person of ordinary intelligence would know that the act of &quot;agreeing to distribute drugs while in the protected area&quot; was illegal. Defendant was convicted of conspiracy because the jury concluded that all of the elements existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed only as to the sentences on the four conspiracy offenses. The case was remanded with direction to merge the convictions on the two conspiracy offenses in each case and to vacate the sentence for one of them. The judgments were affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died from injuries suffered when a car operated by the driver struck him. The administratrix alleged that, because of the driver's multiple convictions for driving under the influence, the commissioner was required to permanently revoke his license. The administratrix also alleged that the commissioner, through his acts or omissions, allowed the driver to maintain a valid driver's license, and to register operate his car. The trial court found that the action was barred by sovereign immunity. The appellate court found that this was proper. Among other things, the state clearly was the real party in interest. Damages were sought for injuries allegedly caused by the commissioner for performing or not performing acts that were part of his official duties. Clearly, the commissioner was sued only because of his official position at the time of the accident. The Supreme Court of Connecticut had explicitly rejected the argument that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 waived the state's sovereign immunity. Because the administratrix sought only monetary damages, costs, and punitive damages, the exception for actions by officers in excess of their statutory authority did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxi driver sued defendants, a taxicab company and the driver and the owner of a vehicle. A jury found defendant driver and the owner 20 percent negligent and the company, on the basis of plaintiff's uninsured motorist (UM) claim, 80 percent negligent; it awarded plaintiff damages. The Superior Court, Judicial District of New Haven, Connecticut, denied the company's motions to set aside the verdict and for remittitur; it appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's taxi was struck by a vehicle driven by defendant driver, who had swerved to avoid a van that had veered into his lane. Plaintiff, an independent contractor, brought the UM claim against the company because the van's owner could not be found. The company argued that the jury's award of non-economic damages and future economic damages should have been set aside as excessive under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-216a. The appellate court disagreed. Applying a plenary standard of review, it found that testimony that plaintiff, then 29, would incur $ 1000 to $ 2000 per year in medical care; that he continued to experience pain and trouble sleeping; and that his spine was compromised and would never return to its pre-injury status, supported the trial court's finding that the damage award was not excessive as a matter of law. The jury reasonably could have determined that a release plaintiff signed was not enforceable due to the company's superior bargaining power, or for one of the other reasons set forth in the jury instructions. The trial court properly excluded statements about plaintiff made by an unknown ambulance driver, as they were unreliable and unduly prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 53a-40(a)(1) (2007)) and was sentenced to a total effective term of 40 years' incarceration. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that admitting hearsay testimony from his former probation officer during the bench trial violated his U.S. Const. amend. VI rights to confrontation under Crawford. The appellate court held that as most of what she testified about--defendant's robbery convictions, use of a gun during those crimes, receipt of disciplinary tickets, and positive drug tests while on probation--were corroborated by his own testimony, any error in admitting this evidence was harmless. The evidence was sufficient to prove that he was a persistent dangerous felony offender and that his history and the circumstances of his crimes indicated that extended incarceration and lifetime supervision would best serve the public interest (&sect; 53a-40(h)). Section 53a-40(h) was not unconstitutionally vague, either as applied to him or on its face. Even assuming the prosecutor improperly characterized the evidence during closing argument, defendant was not deprived of a fair trial as the trial court's instructions that the jury was the sole finder of fact and that arguments made during summation were not facts were sufficient to cure any alleged impropriety, and the evidence of guilt was strong.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that it was error to exclude evidence as to the victim's sexual history as defendant theorized that the victim lied about the sexual assault in order to cover up the possibility that her boyfriend was the source of any infection that a medical examination might have revealed. The evidence was relevant to the first-degree sexual assault charge, but defendant was acquitted on that charge. A new trial was required on a risk of injury charge that stemmed from the sexual assault charge. The victim's sexual relationship with her boyfriend was not relevant to understanding the victim's motive, bias, or interest on the other counts. The exclusion of irrelevant evidence did not infringe on defendant's rights of confrontation and to present evidence. It was not error to exclude two clinic employees' testimony that the victim had given inconsistent statements. While the jury instruction on &sect; 53-21(a)(2) improperly defined likely, accurate instructions minimized any harm. Defendant was convicted of the sexual assault and subjected the minor victim to sexual contact.

Stat. &sect; 17a-112(j)(3)(B) and improperly terminated his parental rights as &sect; 17a-112(j)(3)(B) was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had an extensive criminal history, including manslaughter, threatening, assault, and risk of injury to a child. Despite a licensed psychologist's opinion that it was in the child's best interest to stay with her foster family, the trial court ordered specific steps toward reunification. After a visit, the child accused the father of sexual abuse. Petitioner Department of Children and Families filed a petition for the termination of the father's and the mother's parental rights. While the father completed parenting classes, as he failed to engage in individual therapy and/or sexual offender treatment to enable him to reunify with the child, the trial court found he was unable to address the emotional and physical needs of his child. The appellate court held it was not clearly erroneous for the court to find that the Department was justified in referring the father to sexual offender treatment. The trial court also had sufficient evidence before it to conclude that the Department had begun the process of referring the father to individual counseling, which he preemptively refused. Thus, it properly found that he had failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the revocation of his probation by the Superior Court in the judicial district of Danbury (Connecticut) pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-32. Defendant claims that the trial court impermissibly restricted his cross-examination of a witness and violated his Sixth Amendment right to Confrontation. Alternatively, he argued that the trial court improperly failed to draw a negative inference from the absence of a 911 recording.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Some time after his release from incarceration and the commencement of his term of probation, defendant moved to New York City. The police received a 911 telephone call. The caller reported that a nude man was on the stoop masturbating. The witness later testified that he saw a white lotion on defendant's hands. The police officers examined defendant's residence and observed a trail of droplets of a &quot;white liquid&quot; and a silver dollar sized &quot;dollop&quot; of the white liquid just inside the door on the floor. Defendant argued that the failure to disclose a recording of the 911 call infringed upon his right of confrontation. The appellate court noted that the State never had possession of a recording of the 911 call as one never existed. Thus, there was no violation of the right of confrontation. The trial court provided a lengthy and detailed analysis of its reasoning behind imposing the sentence. The totality of the circumstances gave no indication that the trial court improperly augmented defendant's sentence on the basis of his decision to exercise his privilege to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Tolland (Connecticut) of larceny by embezzlement from a person who was 60 years of age or older under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-123(a)(5), after a mistrial was declared as to nine remaining counts, and her sentence of five years of imprisonment, execution suspended after six months, five years of probation, and restitution of $ 3307.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the evidence supported the conviction. The State showed that defendant made withdrawals totalling $ 3307 from a joint account with the ward. There was sufficient evidence that defendant knew that the victim's assets were under the control of the conservator, that she had been notified of her duty to report to the conservator all accounts held by the ward, whether they were sole or joint accounts, and that she did not do so. There was sufficient evidence that defendant withdrew the $ 3307 from the joint bank accounts with wrongful intent. The jury instructions were proper. The question of defendant's actual ownership right to funds as a joint account holder was a fact question for the jury. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-123(a)(5) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied because defendant was charged with embezzling from a ward's estate. It is not the form in which the property was held, but to whom it belonged that was determinative of a &sect; 53a-123(a) offense. Section 53a-123(a)(5) afforded defendant sufficient notice that it applied to conduct that occurred after a conservator had been appointed for the ward's estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven, Juvenile Matters (Connecticut), adjudicated respondent juvenile a delinquent and committed him, pursuant to an agreed on sentence, to the custody of the commissioner of children and families. Thereafter, the trial court denied respondent's motion to correct an illegal sentence. Respondent appealed, arguing the court exceeded its statutory authority under Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State negotiated a plea agreement in which respondent pleaded guilty to a serious juvenile offense. As part of respondent's agreed on sentence, the trial court issued a separate order for 42 months of banishment from a specific county. The banishment order had expired, and the parties conceded respondent's appeal was moot. In further analysis, respondent's claim did not qualify for review under the &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review&quot; exception. The banishment order was not a condition of respondent's four year commitment to the commissioner, not a component of the treatment plan devised by the commissioner, nor subject to review and modification every six months. It was a separate order entered by the trial court pursuant to the parties' agreement during respondent's delinquency adjudication. As such, it was subject to challenge on direct appeal or pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 43-22. Respondent did not bring a direct appeal or prompt challenge to the order. Respondent's claim became moot because of his delay, not because the banishment order was by its very nature limited in duration or presented a functionally insurmountable time constraint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that after the inmate sustained injuries on September 6, 1988, he was taken to the hospital for treatment. He was discharged from the hospital and arrested on Saturday, September 17, 1988. The inmate was arraigned on Monday, September 19, 1988. The inmate did not show that a warrant issued for his arrest that was sworn on September 9, 1988, was executed before his discharge. The inmate could not have been arraigned on a Saturday, and was properly arraigned on Monday. The arraignment was not delayed past the first possible opportunity for the State to bring him before a judge. Further, &sect; 54-1g was not contravened even if the inmate had been arrested during his hospitalization as the police were not free to remove him and have him arraigned until the hospital staff determined that he medically was able to be discharged. Connecticut did not provide for in-hospital arraignments. The inmate was arraigned as the first regular sitting of the trial court following his return to police custody. Prior counsel did not provide deficient performance, and the inmate was not prejudiced. The inmate was properly denied certification to appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-466, claiming insufficient proof of probation violations. Respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the inmate was no longer in custody on the probation violations. The Superior Court in the judicial district of Tolland (Connecticut) granted the motion. Upon being granted certification, the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1996, the inmate was convicted of three offenses and sent to prison. After his release, the inmate was arrested and charged with one count of sale of narcotics and three counts of violation of probation, resulting from his 1996 convictions. The trial court terminated the probations, accepted the inmate's guilty plea to sale of narcotics, and sentenced him on that charge to a term of imprisonment. The inmate, acting as a self-represented party, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and later amended the petition. The inmate argued the habeas court failed to construe his amended petition as a challenge to his current conviction for sale of narcotics. The inmate's passing reference to his 2007 arrest in his amended petition could not be read as an attack on his resulting sentence on that charge, even under the most liberal reading of the petitions. The habeas court properly construed the original and amended petitions together as contesting only the findings that the inmate violated his probation and not on his present sentence for sale of narcotics. The inmate did not preserve the claim that the habeas court failed to construe his petitions as a writ of error coram nobis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence, because the police lacked a sufficient reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct and his subsequent detention by police was unconstitutionally prolonged. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the police had reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop. Among other things, the police were on the lookout for suspicious activity associated with a brown car with Colorado license plates. After a car matching that description stopped in front of a school, defendant suddenly appeared, leaned into the car, and walked away 20 seconds later. The trial court cited to the officer's 20 plus years of experience in determining whether he possessed a reasonable and articulable suspicion to detain defendant. The appellate court also found that the 12 to 15 detention of defendant was not illegal, but was tied to, and justified by, the circumstances that gave rise to the officer's reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was involved in a drug transaction. The detection allowed an officer to pursue the vehicle, search it, and have defendant identify a passenger.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose out a phone call to her place of employment, a post office. On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that her conviction for harassment had to be reversed because application of the harassment statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-183(a)(3), to her phone conversation implicated her rights under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. The appellate court agreed, finding that, while the statute on its face did not infringe on defendant's freedom on speech, it was unconstitutional as applied because defendant was punished for the verbal content of her phone call and not the actual making of the call. Defendant also claimed that the trial court improperly instructed the jury. The appellate court agreed as to the breach of peace charge, but not as to the harassment charge. As to the breach of peace charge, the trial court should have instructed the jury to consider the factual context in which the allegedly threatening conduct occurred. The appellate court found the evidence sufficient to support the breach of peace charge, thereby permitted a retrial on that charge, but insufficient to support the harassment charge, necessitating an acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial on the breach of peace charge and with direction to render a judgment of not guilty on the harassment charge.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court in the judicial district of Tolland (Connecticut) denied the petition. The inmate appealed.

The plea on the assault charge was vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's claim that trial counsel was ineffective because he provided erroneous legal advice, including incorrect information on the possible sentence, causing the inmate to enter unknowing, unintelligent, and involuntary guilty pleas failed, because the court was clear in going over the terms of the plea agreement with the inmate and the inmate was clear that he understood those terms. While the appellate court found that counsel was ineffective for providing the inmate with incorrect information regarding the maximum possible sentence the inmate was facing, the inmate failed to prove that, absent such incorrect information, he would have insisted on going to trial. The inmate also claimed that counsel failed to attend most of court hearing and did not engage in ongoing meaningful plea negotiations. The inmate could not prove that counsel was rendered ineffective assistance as to plea negotiations, as the inmate was facing nearly 40 on the charges that could have moved forward and up to 65 years if the information were amended to conform to the evidence, but counsel secured a sentence of nine years, suspended after four, with five years probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a minority leader for a city board of aldermen (ML), appealed a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Waterbury (Connecticut), which was granted in part for him in his quo warranto and mandamus action, wherein he challenged the appointment of defendant commissioner to certain city commission positions by defendants, a mayor and a zoning commission (ZC). The commissioner also appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mayor had the duty to appoint city electors to various boards and commissions pursuant to Waterbury, Conn., Charter Chapter 4, &sect; 4-2. Although the ML provided names of suggested electors to be appointed, others were appointed by either the mayor or the ZC for various commissions. The ML challenged those appointments. The trial court granted a writ of quo warranto and ordered the ouster of one commissioner. However, it denied the same relief as to another commissioner, and it denied a request for mandamus relief against the ZC. On appeal, the court reviewed the Waterbury, Conn., Charter and found that the trial court had interpreted it correctly. The restriction on the mayor's appointment under &sect; 4-2(b)(1) was not applicable to appointments by, inter alia, the ZC under &sect; 4-2(b)(2). Accordingly, denial of the quo warranto as to the ZC's appointment was proper. Based on that same reasoning, a writ of mandamus against the ZC was properly denied. As to the grant of quo warranto with respect to one commissioner, the court found that the mayor's failure to adhere to the restrictions under &sect; 4-2(b)(1) necessitated that relief. Section 4-2(b)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk, Connecticut, defendant was convicted of, inter alia, assault of a peace officer (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-167c(a)(1)) and interfering with an officer (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-167a(a)). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When an officer approached defendant's car he accelerated and almost hit the officer. A second officer pursued defendant. He fled from his car and fought with the officer, who testified that he sustained pain, bloody knees, and injuries to his ankle and Achilles tendon. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove he had the specific intent to injure the officer or that the officer was injured by him. The appellate court disagreed. The requisite intent under &sect; 53a-167c was the intent to prevent the officer from performing his duties, not to injure him; the evidence was sufficient to prove that intent and that defendant's actions were a proximate cause of the injuries. The jury was properly instructed on specific intent. As an instruction on intervening cause was not warranted by the evidence, failing to give it was not error. Section 53a-167c(a)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided fair warning that a specific intent to injure an officer was not an element of the offense. Under State v. Mincewicz, defendant's convictions of both interfering with an officer and assault of a peace officer violated the double jeopardy ban on multiple punishments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence for interfering with an officer was vacated and his conviction on that charge was combined with his conviction of assault of a peace officer; the case was remanded for resentencing. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found no error, noting that the trial court found that the police used eight photos in the array, the array was composed of individuals who strongly resembled defendant, no suggestion was made to the victim that a photo of the suspected perpetrator was in the array, and no verbal or physical hints were given by police. The fact that defendant's photo was in both arrays was not unconstitutionally suggestive in defendant's case, as the entire array was repeated. The appellate court also found no error in the exclusion of defendant's proffered expert on identification testimony, as the expert had no special expertise with respect to identifications by the elderly or sexual assault victims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee, claiming she was terminated due to her pregnancy, sued defendant State of Connecticut for wrongful termination, employment discrimination in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-60, and breach of contract. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford, Connecticut, denied the State's motion to dismiss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that plaintiff's wrongful termination and breach of contract claims were barred by sovereign immunity. The appellate court agreed. Plaintiff's employment was not governed by the Connecticut Personnel Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-193 et seq., as she contended, but by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-12, under which the judiciary promulgated its own personnel policies, and &sect; 51-12 did not expressly or impliedly waive the State's sovereign immunity. As her employment was governed only by &sect; 51-12, and not by any implied contract, her breach of contract claim failed. The State's waiver of sovereign immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-100 was conditioned on plaintiff's exhausting her administrative remedies with the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities. As she did not satisfy the exhaustion requirement as to claims brought under &sect; 46a-60(a)(4) and (5), she could not obtain, as to those claims, a release of jurisdiction pursuant to &sect; 46a-100 and, therefore, was not entitled to take advantage of the State's statutory waiver of sovereign immunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges arose out of defendant's attack on his girlfriend. Defendant argued that, because the weapon used was not in evidence and the victim testified that she did not know what caused her injuries, there was insufficient evidence that the weapon was a dangerous instrument under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-3(7). The appellate court found that the evidence showed that the victim was seriously disfigured, and had scarring from the injuries inflicted by defendant. The jury reasonably could have found that the lacerations and the resulting scarring on the victim's nose amounted to a serious disfigurement. According to the victim's treating physician, the cut to her nose was most likely caused by a sharp object. The victim told police that she had been cut with an object, possibly a knife. The jury reasonably could have inferred that defendant used a dangerous instrument in the attack, capable of causing serious disfigurement or serious physical injury and that it in fact caused such injury. Statements made by the prosecutor in closing argument were improper, but defendant did not satisfy the severity prong of the Thompson standard. Further, the State's case was strong.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court, Judicial District of Fairfield, Connecticut, of third degree assault of an elderly person (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-61a) and second degree breach of the peace (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-181(a)(2)). She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 71-year-old victim testified that defendant, while wearing a ring, struck him several times in the head, causing bleeding, ringing in his ear, confusion, disorientation, and hearing loss. The appellate court held that as the jury could have inferred from the victim's testimony that he was in pain due to the beating and that defendant intended to injure him, the evidence supported defendant's conviction of third degree assault of an elderly person. As the jury reasonably could have inferred that by assaulting the victim, defendant further intended to &quot;cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly created a risk thereof,&quot; the evidence supported her conviction of second degree breach of the peace. Defendant's claim that the trial court improperly diluted the State's burden of proof by charging the jury not to be swayed by sympathy was meritless, as the instruction the trial court gave had been previously found to be proper. As the State, and not defendant, requested a charge on the lesser included offense of assault in the third degree, defendant failed to satisfy the first prong of State v. Whistnant and thus was not entitled to a lesser included offense charge.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendant waived his argument that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that defendant's bare hands were dangerous instruments for purposes of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-59(a)(1). The court properly admitted into evidence a facsimile of a serrated knife that the state argued that he used during the attack because the parties jointly stipulated to its admission in order to avoid admitting a knife found in defendant's car that was stained with a red substance. The facsimile was relevant to explain the origin of the victim's injuries, even though it was larger than the knife the victim described. Jury instructions did not improperly comment on defendant's self-interest in the outcome of the trial or on the state's interest in protecting innocent persons from being convicted of crimes. The instruction on reasonable doubt was not constitutionally infirm. The evidence was sufficient to show that the victim was seriously injured, an element of first-degree assault, and that defendant intended to cause such injury.</SPAN></P>

The court first held that &sect; 53-21(a)(1) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. Lawful behavior that presented a foreseeable risk of injury to a child fell under the purview of &sect; 53-21(a)(1). Here, although the conduct at issue was otherwise lawful, a reasonable person would recognize that allowing a two-year-old child to play unsupervised in a home situated near a busy street, with an unlocked back door and no child safety devices, presented a foreseeable risk of injury to that child. Furthermore, cases provided notice that a defendant's failure to protect a child from harm created a situation that was violative of &sect; 53-21(a)(1). Next, the evidence was sufficient to show that defendant's failure to supervise his children adequately, despite his knowledge that the back door of his home was unsecured, amounted to a reckless disregard for a situation that was inimical to the physical welfare of his child. Finally, the trial court properly revoked defendant's probation. It considered his long criminal history in addition to his violation of &sect; 53-21.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut), which convicted him of one count of risk of injury to a child, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(a)(2); two counts of risk of injury to a child, in violation of Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from actions he took toward a six-year-old female, for whom he was a great uncle. Defendant regularly visited the victim's home and when the victim's mother was at work, allegedly performed a sexual act upon himself while in the kitchen. Shortly thereafter, defendant watched the victim while she used the bathroom. Further, in another incident, the victim stated that defendant touched her buttocks under her pajamas. On appeal, defendant claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(a)(1) was void for vagueness. However, the court held that the statute was not vague as applied to the circumstances of the case since it afforded defendant sufficient notice that performing a sex act in the kitchen where a six-year-old could observe him was prohibited by &sect; 53-21(a)(1) as the statute prohibited wilfully creating a situation in which the morals of a minor were likely to be impaired. The court rejected defendant's argument that merely looking at the victim while she used the bathroom was prohibited conduct under the statute as such action, especially after the kitchen incident, threatened the victim's morality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, respondent pro se parents challenged multiple decisions of the trial court (Connecticut) relating to petitioner commissioner of children and families' efforts to terminate their parental relationship with two minor children and/or to reunited the parents with the children. The commissioner appealed from a court order granting unsupervised visitation to the parents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner took custody of the children, who were adjudged neglected. One trial court found that the commissioner need not reunify the family because the parents were delusional. A subsequent trial court ordered the commissioner to facilitate reunification under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-129(b), (d), and (j) and provide parental visitation under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-10a(a). On consolidated appeals of 10 different court orders, the court held, inter alia, that the  parents offered no evidence in support of their motion to revoke the children's commitment. The trial court appropriately required the parents to take specific steps before unsupervised visitation and reunification could occur, including cooperating with the commissioner and visiting the children as often as the commissioner permitted. The trial court properly found that the commissioner was not in contempt of the visitation order because the parents bore the responsibility for failing to attend scheduled visitations. Based on a therapist's recommendation, the trial court properly ordered that the children not be forced to visit with their parents and properly transferred the case for a child protection hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed five of the trial court's orders concerning the children and dismissed the appeals of five other court orders for lack of jurisdiction based on mootness, including the commissioner's  appeal.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-303, and refused to reduce her award by the amount of social security widow's benefits she received.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was a cross-country truck driver. He was found dead in the sleeper cab of the employer's truck. An autopsy report established that the cause of death was ischemic heart disease. The widow filed a workers' compensation claim. The appellate court held that the evidence supported the Commissioner's finding with a reasonable medical probability that the stress of the employee's job and its limitations on his time for other activities was a substantial factor in the chain of events that precipitated his fatal disease. The Board correctly ruled that the plain meaning of the Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-301(f), provided no alternative to the payment of an award during the pendency of an appeal if the widow sought payment. Defendants' continuing refusal to compensate the widow for the compensable death of the employee was the type of behavior that &sect; 31-303, by its terms, had to prevent. Defendants' request for a setoff was properly denied. The plain meaning of the Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-307(e) (Rev. to 1997), showed that was inapplicable to the widow's simultaneous collection of widow's benefits and social security widow's benefits under the Act, Conn. Gen.

Defendant subsequently sped away and crossed the Connecticut state line. The officer pursued defendant. Other officers joined the pursuit. The officers proceeded to defendant's residence, parked and awaited the arrival of Connecticut authorities. After finding defendant's car, without the bag, the officer retraced the route of the pursuit and located the bag in an open field. The appellate court held the trial court properly determined that the officer was in hot pursuit of defendant at the time he searched defendant's property. The fact that the officer was a police officer from another state did not make his search in Connecticut per se unconstitutional. The search required neither a warrant nor an exception because it was conducted in an area, an open field, where defendant could not legitimately expect privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At approximately 1:30 a.m., police officers observed a car being operated by defendant stop in a high drug area. The car had Vermont license plates, indicating it was potentially a rental car, a tactic used by drug dealers. A pedestrian approached the passenger side of the car and briefly conversed with the occupants before continuing on her way. She subsequently told the officers the occupants had asked her, using slang, if she was interested in purchasing drugs. The police stopped the car. The occupants moved around, turned their heads and ducked. An officer searched the passenger compartment and located a smaller compartment behind a child's car seat. The officer discovered a handgun. Defendant argued that the officers' brief conversation with the pedestrian, viewed in isolation, did not yield facts that supported a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity as there was no showing that the pedestrian was reliable. The appellate court rejected that argument and held there were many factors that constituted the totality of the circumstances known to the police to support an investigative stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant, a pretrial detainee, guilty of assault of public safety personnel, a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-167c(a)(5). The Superior Court in the judicial district of Fairfield (Connecticut) denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal and rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. Defendant appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and the requirement that he wear prison garb during the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant spat on an employee's face and chest, the jury could have found that defendant intended to assault the employee and to prevent him from performing his duties. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. However, the court found that the trial court improperly compelled defendant to wear prison garb at trial, in violation of his U.S. amend. VI and XIV, &sect; 1, right to a fair and impartial trial. In order to protect the fair trial right and the presumption of innocence, a record had to be made establishing an essential state policy for the garb and shackles. If an interest was shown, jurors had to be instructed not to consider defendant's appearance when determining guilt or innocence. The potential prejudice was especially great because the jury had to find that defendant had the required mens rea. The intent evidence sufficed for a conviction but was not so overwhelming that there was no reasonable possibility that appearance might have contributed to the conviction. The State did not prove that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant did not receive a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of New London (Connecticut) which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charges of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a and with operating a motor vehicle while his license was suspended under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-215. The State claimed a moped  was a &quot;motor vehicle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was operating a moped with a motor of less than 50 cubic centimeters on a public highway. State police troopers observed him traveling at a speed of approximately 30 miles per hour. The moped was traveling in the right shoulder of the road and crossed over into the travel lane of the roadway several times. A trooper testified that there appeared to be a light attached to the rear of the moped, but the light was difficult to see as it was hanging loosely off the back of the moped. Defendant pulled into a parking lot. As a trooper spoke with defendant about the taillight being a public safety concern, he noticed that defendant had bloodshot eyes and an odor of alcohol on his breath. The trooper performed a series of field sobriety tests and placed defendant under arrest. The appellate court held that whether a vehicle was wholly self-propelled did not change whether it was a vehicle, and thus a motor vehicle, for the purposes of chapter 248. Per Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-212(5), any vehicle that was driven on the public highways was a motor vehicle under chapter 248. Thus, the moped was a motor vehicle for purposes of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-215 and 14-227a.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for manslaughter by the Superior Court in the judicial district of Fairfield (Connecticut). Defendant claimed that the trial court denied him his constitutional and statutory rights to present relevant self-defense evidence, improperly instructed the jury on self-defense, failed to inquire adequately into alleged juror bias and improperly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stabbed the victim with a box-cutter after an extended argument. Although the trial court limited defendant's cross-examination of a witness to events that occurred after a certain date, it admitted evidence that the victim had been convicted of threatening in the second degree, assault in the third degree four separate times, and assault in the second degree. The jury also heard testimony that the victim was in prison numerous times and was a member of a street gang. Further, defendant was able fully to cross-examine each witness who observed the confrontation and to present witnesses on his behalf to establish his self-defense claim. The appellate court held defendant's cross-examination of the witness was not unduly restricted and that the limitation imposed by the trial court did not infringe on defendant's confrontational and due process rights. The trial court's charge on defendant's duty to retreat that the charge complied with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-19(b) and (c). The trial did not abuse its discretion by the limited scope of its investigation of alleged juror bias and its conclusion regarding the absence of juror bias found adequate support in the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield (Connecticut), which convicted him of six crimes involving the sale and possession of narcotics by a person who was not drug-dependent within 1,500 feet of a school.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from an undercover operation. Defendant asserted on appeal that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized during a search of his vehicle at the scene. The court disagreed and held that the warrantless search of his vehicle and the seizure of the items found within it was constitutionally valid pursuant to the automobile exception since the totality of the facts were sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that more narcotics would be found in the vehicle based on defendant driving his vehicle to the scene and providing narcotics for all of the customers inside a restaurant, which indicated that he was in possession of a substantial quantity of narcotics that were not for his personal use. Further, the police finding narcotics in defendant's cellular telephone showed that he had even more narcotics to sell, thus, it was reasonable for the officers to infer that there was a fair probability he was storing even more narcotics in his vehicle. The court found that no prosecutorial misconduct occurred during closing argument, nor did the trial court err on instructing the jury on reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The court found no merit to defendant's challenges to the value of the property provided at trial since the owners were competent to testify as to their opinion of the value of the jewelry stolen as well as provided their estimates of what the items were originally purchased for. Further, testimony from the owners' insurance agent as to the items of jewelry not recovered also was sufficient.

As a result, a warrant for his arrest for a violation of probation was issued pursuant to &sect; 53a-32. Defendant claimed that by holding the probation and drug dependency hearings before a trial on the pending criminal charges, he was prevented from testifying and presenting a defense of his drug dependency, in violation of his Sixth Amendment right, and that instead he had to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent so as not to incriminate himself in his other pending matters. The appellate court found, inter alia, that after defendant was informed of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, he conferred with his attorney and weighed his options. Thereafter, he chose not to present a defense as to his drug dependency, but rather to exercise his right of allocution. The fact that defendant had to make a difficult choice between two constitutional rights did not deprive him of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford (Connecticut), rendered after a jury trial, finding him guilty of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child in violation of Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed (1) the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction under the &quot;situation&quot; prong of &sect; 53-21(a)(1), and (2)&nbsp;&sect; 53-21(a)(1) was unconstitutionally vague as applied in the case. The appeals court found defendant engaged the victim in flirtatious conversation, grabbed her wrist and neck, and attempted to pull her forcibly through his vehicle's open window. Pursuant to &sect; 53-21(a)(1), ample evidence was offered from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that defendant had attempted to engage the victim in conduct that would result in injury to her physical well-being or mental health, or the impairment of her morals. A person of ordinary intelligence would have understood that this conduct constituted a substantial step in furtherance of the crime of attempt to commit risk of injury to a child. Defendant, by means of the common and legal meanings of &quot;health,&quot; &quot;impairment,&quot; and &quot;morals,&quot; and through legal precedents, had fair warning that this conduct was violative of the situation prong of &sect; 53-21(a)(1). Section 53-21(a)(1) provided fair notice and guidance to defendant sufficient to allow him to determine whether his conduct was permitted or prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress his statement was denied. A jury convicted defendant of first degree assault, first degree conspiracy to commit assault, and two counts of first degree assault as an accessory. The Superior Court in the judicial district of Danbury (Connecticut) sentenced defendant to a total effective term of 40 years, execution suspended after 30 years, with five years probation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress because defendant was under the influence of alcohol at the time police took his statement and thus, it was not voluntary. The appellate court found that defendant was not intoxicated, having last consumed alcohol more than 20 hours before giving the statement. In addition, defendant was familiar with his rights and voluntarily signed the waiver form. Defendant also argued that the trial court improperly failed to alleviate the jury's apparent confusion over the meaning of the word &quot;aided&quot; in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-59. The appellate court concluded that defendant waived any right to challenge the instruction when he specifically told the court that he agreed with the court's definition and that he did not want further instructions. Finally, defendant argued the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the State failed to prove that he was aided by two or more persons. The appellate court disagreed, finding that there was sufficient evidence that one person's attack of a second victim aided defendant and that a second person acting as a lookout also aided defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions by the Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford (Connecticut) for, inter alia, attempt to commit murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the trial, the victim made reference to defendant selling crack. The trial court struck the testimony and instructed the jury to disregard it. Defendant declined the trial court's offer of a curative instruction regarding another witness's testimony which made reference to defendant's criminal past. In declining the instruction, the defendant made a legitimate tactical decision not to emphasize the testimony. The trial court will not second-guess such decisions on appeal. The appellate court could not conclude that it was apparent to the trial court that the challenged testimony deprived defendant of a fair trial. Although the appellate court agreed that the prosecutor committed impropriety in mentioning certain specifics of defendant's prior felony conviction, it determined that defendant was not denied a fair trial. The trial court properly weighed the possible prejudice of the letter against its probative value. Not only did the court find that the letter was not more prejudicial than probative, but it also clearly instructed the jury that the letter did not raise a presumption of guilt and could be considered only as evidence that the defendant was conscious of guilt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers executed an arrest warrant for defendant at an apartment and found him sitting on a couch. Defendant was arrested. A detective removed the cushions from the couch and discovered a pistol. A sergeant noticed a box of ammunition. He conducted a protective sweep of the apartment and discovered narcotics on the kitchen counter. Defendant moved to suppress all tangible evidence recovered from him and the apartment. The trial court found that the contraband seized from the kitchen was discovered during a search incident to a lawful arrest. The appellate court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. Once defendant was placed under arrest pursuant to a valid warrant, the sergeant properly conducted a search for any weapons or evidence within defendant's immediate control. It would not have been impossible for defendant to have reached items located in the area searched because the distance between the couch and the kitchen counter was six to eight feet. The fact that defendant was handcuffed did not foreclose the possibility that he could have been able to reach a weapon.</SPAN></P>

The general grounds for relief in the second petition were the same as previously alleged: prosecutorial impropriety and ineffective assistance of counsel. The appellate court held that the record was inadequate to permit review of the inmate's claim that his second petition was based on new evidence. He did not offer any supporting facts as to why, with the exercise of due diligence, this evidence was not discoverable at time of the original petition, and he did not file a transcript of the relevant portions of his first habeas trial. Without a complete record, the appellate court was unable to determine whether the allegedly new evidence reasonably could have been incorporated into the inmate's original petition. Therefore, it declined to reach the merits of his claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife married, had a minor daughter, and divorced.

The wife then filed a motion for contempt in the trial court and alleged he had disobeyed the trial court's earlier order. After a hearing, the trial court found the husband in contempt and awarded the wife attorney fees. The husband appealed. The appellate court considered the two appeals and found that (1) as to the first appeal, the trial court erred in ordering the husband to obtain the insurance without having evidence as to its cost, (2) the trial court properly applied Conn. Gen.

Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 6-38a, 6-38b(g); U.S. Const. amend. V, XIII, and XIV; and Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. The Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford (Connecticut) granted the commission's motion to dismiss on grounds of sovereign immunity. The marshal appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Even though the complained-of policy was replaced by another policy that no longer required the marshal to appear at a courthouse in person, the court found that the appeal was not moot because the policy was subject to change at the discretion of the commission or the judicial branch and the main issue was whether the implementation of procedures under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-38b(g) violated the marshal's rights as an independent contractor. The court found that the marshal's claim did not fall under the second exception to the sovereign immunity doctrine because he failed to show that he had a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest. The marshal's claim that the commission exceeded its authority did not fall within the third exception. The commission had authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 6-38b(g), (k) to implement a policy to aid in its statutory responsibility to ensure the expeditious service of restraining orders. The marshal's complaint lacked any factual allegations that, if proven, reasonably would have supported his assertion that the commission acted in excess of its statutory authority in implementing the policy.</SPAN></P>

The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because (1) the scope of a search incident to the arrest of a car's driver included the passenger compartment, regardless of whether the arrestee could gain access to it: (2) the cash was recovered from the trunk pursuant to the standardized procedures of an inventory search; and (3) the cash seized constituted drug proceeds. Forfeiture of the cash to the state was authorized by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-36a(c).

Defendant argued that if counsel had effectively interviewed the victim and adequately investigated the scene of the accident, he could have pursued a causation defense for the assault charge. Defendant alleged that the victim grabbed the steering wheel and caused the accident. The appellate court found that counsel's investigation was adequate based on her testimony that she reviewed police and witness reports and spoke with defendant about the reports' contents and avenues of possible further investigation. Counsel also testified that she informed defendant that a causation defense was problematic because he would have to testify, subjecting him to cross-examination and exposure of his inconsistent statement to police after the accident that he did not remember what caused the accident. The appellate court also found no merit in defendant's claim that his guilty pleas were not knowingly entered into but were made because counsel led him to believe that by pleading guilty he would gain more time to hire a private attorney.</SPAN></P>

The officers' actions in immediately exiting their vehicle and approaching defendant's vehicle while asking him to roll down his window and wearing marked shirts and badges demonstrated their authority in such a manner that a reasonable person would not have believed that he was free to leave. Next, under the totality of the circumstances, the seizure was not based on a reasonable and articulable suspicion under &sect; 7 and the Fourth Amendment. The informant did not indicate that he had observed any illegal activity. There was no other indication of firsthand knowledge on the part of the informant, who did not demonstrate any knowledge of defendant's future behavior. When the officers saw the defendant several hours after the call from the informant, they did not witness any illegal activity.

Defendant appealed, claiming that he should have been allowed to withdraw his plea after the trial court imposed a 24-hour house arrest condition and a no arrest condition as part of a Garvin agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been arrested and charged with robbery in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-134(a)(4). The court found that the trial judge did not err in refusing to disqualify himself from adjudicating the motion to withdraw the plea. The judge's conduct would not have led a reasonable person to question his impartiality, and no relevant case law was cited to support a claim that the judge who presided over a plea pursuant to a Garvin agreement should not have presided over a motion to withdraw the plea. Raising defendant's bond after he was arrested on another charge was appropriate and did not indicate bias. The trial court's finding that defendant understood that a curfew condition was actually a 24-hour house arrest was not clearly erroneous, and the challenged no arrest condition was not invalid. Because defendant did not meet his burden under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 39-27, there was no abuse of discretion in denying the motion to withdraw his guilty plea as to the house arrest condition. An argument that the probable cause standard was improperly used to determine whether he breached the Garvin agreement was not supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's challenge to the admission of a chisel found in the victim's car failed as a chain of custody was established and the victim identified it as the same one she removed from her car. Next, the appellate court found no merit in defendant's claim of prosecutorial impropriety, noting that the prosecutor's arguments were based on facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn from them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven denied the petition. Defendant appealed. Defendant had claimed ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to prosecute the appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder. His conviction was affirmed on appeal. Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The habeas court denied the petition as it found he had failed to meet his burden of proof as to ineffective assistance of counsel. The court granted the petition for certification to appeal. Defendant's counsel failed to file a timely appeal. Now, on appeal, defendant's only claim was that the habeas court should have permitted him to introduce evidence in support of his claim of appellate delay. The commissioner of the department of corrections objected to the attempt of defendant's counsel to offer evidence concerning appellate delay. The habeas court sustained the objection as it found that there was no prejudice. The appellate court held it was clear from the record that the habeas court understood that the delay had occurred but afforded the aspect of the Barker factors the appropriate weight because, in fact, defendant suffered no prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in the judicial district of Waterbury (Connecticut) denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence and convicted him on a jury's verdict that found him guilty of robbery and kidnapping, violations of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-134(a)(3) and &sect; 53a-92(a)(2)(B), respectively. Defendant's sentence was enhanced for being a persistent dangerous felony offender, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-40. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that defendant's guest had common authority to consent to a warrantless entry into defendant's apartment because the guest had been staying there for a few weeks and others had come and gone while he was staying there. As a result, the officers were lawfully in a location where they could hear the ringing of a victim's cell phone, which was under a mattress, and the guest directed the officers' attention to a wastebasket where the victims' possessions were found. The guest's consent was not coerced. The one-on-one pretrial identification procedure was reliable because the victims identified defendant within two hours of the incident and they accurately described him before the challenged identification. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the guest's signed, prior inconsistent written statement into evidence for substantive purposes under the Whelan rule, even though the guest was found to be not credible, because credibility was grist for cross examination. Because the trial court, rather than the jury, made the requisite Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-40(h) public interest finding, defendant was entitled to a new sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of conviction only as to the sentence imposed and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A substitute information charged defendant with violations of Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's warrantless arrest on property was lawful because the property was sufficiently enclosed, even with a small gateless entryway, to bring it within the protections of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-109(a)(1). The appellate court rejected defendant's Fourth Amendment argument that officers' search was only based on a hunch. There was more than ample evidence from which to form a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was carrying contraband. There were prior reports of ongoing drug activity at the location. An officer recognized defendant and his companion from prior drug-related arrests. The officers saw defendant hide behind a wall and squat with his hand down the back of his pants, and they knew from past experience that drug dealers hid illegal drugs down their pants, between the cheeks of their buttocks, to evade detection. Defendant resisted an attempt to pat down the seat of his pants. Defendant's conduct during a properly conducted Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-33k strip search was consistent with an attempt to hide contraband. The search was not a Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-33l(b) body cavity search because there was no physical intrusion into defendant's anus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declined to review defendant's unpreserved claim that the trial court improperly failed to instruct on self-defense with regard to the charge of attempted assault. In such a situation, to implicate a constitutional right, a defendant had to assert a claim of self-defense and present evidence to warrant a jury instruction on the defense. Here, defendant had not requested an instruction on self-defense, had not objected to the instruction given, and had not presented sufficient evidence to justify an instruction of self-defense. Thus, he had failed to demonstrate that his claim implicated a constitutional right. Next, defendant argued that the jury instruction regarding reasonable doubt was improper. Noting that this issue was also unpreserved for review, the court, reviewing the charge in its entirety, concluded that it was not reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury. The trial court had stated, &quot;The burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt requires the State to produce sufficient evidence to create in your minds a strong and abiding conviction of his guilt.&quot; The courts had upheld instructional language that was similar or identical.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state employee sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut), which dismissed her discrimination claims against defendants, the Office of the Attorney General as an employer and various employees, arising from the employee's termination from employment. She asserted claims of age, sex, and disability discrimination under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 46a-60(a)(1) and 46a-70(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed an administrative complaint, alleging harassment, hostile work environment, and discrimination. The matter was released upon a finding of insufficient evidence of discrimination. The employee filed a federal action, which resulted in dismissals or summary judgment against her. The employee filed suit in a Connecticut court and defendants sought summary judgment. The trial court dismissed the claims, finding that the employee failed to obtain the requisite authorization prior to bringing the claims against the State. Further, the trial court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;46a-99 provided her with a private right of action for injunctive relief. On appeal, the court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;46a-100 determined the applicable venue, but it did not constitute a waiver of the State's immunity. As the employee did not apply to the Claims Commissioner prior to bringing her claim under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-60(a)(1), the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Dismissal of the claim under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-70(a) was also proper, as Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-99 did not waive sovereign immunity for money damages.</SPAN></P>

After the officer did not find anything illegal on defendant's person, the officer asked defendant if he had anything illegal in the car. Defendant responded by stating that there was just some beer on the floor and to go ahead and check. The officer subsequently searched the entire car and found drugs. The appellate court concluded that defendant was unlawfully detained, that his consent to search the vehicle was tainted by that illegal detention and that the State failed to purge the taint of the illegal detention. Thus, the evidence procured through defendant's consent should have been suppressed. the record clearly revealed that the officer's inquiry into other suspected illegal activity came after his purpose for effectuating the stop had been achieved.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut) for three counts of sexual assault in the first degree and two counts of risk of injury to a child. Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly admitted hearsay evidence and constancy of accusation testimony, and improperly charged the jury on reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Beginning when the victim was approximately four years old, she periodically was sexually assaulted in her home by defendant, her father. According to the victim's testimony, the assaults took place sporadically and without any set pattern. Shortly after the first incident, the victim told her older sister about what had happened. The victim did not tell anybody else about the assaults until she was in the fourth grade, when she told a classmate. Later, in the sixth grade, the victim also told the classmate that she feared she was pregnant by her father. The classmate did not tell anybody about the victim's disclosures. Following the victim's birthday in sixth grade, she told another classmate about being molested. She then told her teacher. The appellate court held that the report of a licensed nurse practitioner was not improperly admitted as any evidence gathered at the clinic was incidental to the medical component of the examination. The classmate's testimony was admissible under the Troupe limitations to the constancy of accusation doctrine because it corroborated the timing of the victim's complaint. The jury instructions did not unconstitutionally reduce the State's burden.</SPAN></P>

The affidavit in support of the warrant application detailed the affiants' knowledge of defendant's involvement in the sale of marijuana, but the warrant itself named cocaine and crack cocaine, not marijuana, as an item to be seized. Police executed the warrant and seized several pounds of marijuana. The detective who prepared the application testified that cocaine was listed as an item to be seized because he had made a mistake when copying another warrant. The appellate court held that as the warrant did not describe the property sought, it was invalid. That the affidavit adequately described the &quot;things to be seized&quot; was immaterial, as the Fourth Amendment required particularity in the warrant, not in the supporting documents. The warrant did not incorporate other documents by reference, and was not accompanied by either the affidavit or the application. And as police were not lawfully on the premises where the marijuana was found, the plain view doctrine did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk (Connecticut), which convicted him of intimidation based on bigotry or bias in the second degree, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-181k(a)(3) for threatening an individual while using a racial slur, and of breach of the peace in the second degree, in violation of Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from his attendance at a flea market. The victim was a neighbor to the parking lot where the flea market was held. The victim approached a woman and asked her not to dump her garbage. The victim called the police to report the dumping and, as he approached the parking lot again, defendant called him a foul name, used a racial slur, and made a gesture with his hands to indicate he wanted the victim to engage in a fight. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-181k(a)(3) on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face and unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. The court held that &sect; 53a-181k(a)(3) was not overbroad as it only criminalized true threats. Further, defendant's words and actions constituted an indication that something was impending, namely, a physical confrontation, and a person of ordinary intelligence would readily comprehend that defendant's actions were prohibited by &sect; 53a-181k(a)(3), therefore, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. The court found no merit in any of the evidentiary errors alleged by defendant on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an insurance company and its affiliates, filed an action against defendant reinsurance companies for breach of various reinsurance contracts. Plaintiffs filed a motion under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-27 to either compel the posting of prepleading security or to strike defendants' answer and special defenses. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of Waterbury (Connecticut) denied the motion. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with the reinsurance contracts, some defendants were served through agents rather than through substituted service. The court stated that as a remedial statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-27 was to be liberally construed. In light of the repeated references in the statute to other sections of Conn. Gen. Stat. tit. 38a, the court was not persuaded that the statute was meant to provide the remedy of prepleading security only if an unauthorized insurer was served through substituted service. It would be illogical to debar a plaintiff from this remedy because it had used a method of service authorized by contract. Next, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-271(c), Conn. Gen. Stat.&nbsp;&sect; 38a-27 did not apply to transactions involving industrial insureds. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-271(c), however, categorically prevented any part of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 38a-271 to 38a-278 from being applied to reinsurance contracts. Finally, if Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-27 were read literally to deny defendants a hearing on the amount of security they had to post, this would violate due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, defendants were entitled to a hearing on this issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment. It remanded the case for a determination of the appropriate amount of prepleading security, a question on which both parties would be entitled to present evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was a superintendent at defendant's power plant.

Defendant terminated plaintiff in response. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendant upon determining that no genuine issues of material fact existed regarding defendant's claims that plaintiff's complaint was untimely filed with the Commission. The court determined, noting that the case was of first impression, that the time limit of 180 days set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-82(e) was mandatory and that, because plaintiff filed his complaint within 180 days from the final day of his employment, the complaint was timely filed. The court further found that plaintiff established a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that he was the oldest power plant employee and the only one retained.</SPAN></P>

The application for visitation contained no specific allegations of either the requisite relationship or harm. The mere act of checking a box on the application for visitation form that provided that the applicant had a relationship with the children that was similar in nature to a parent-child relationship and denial of visitation would cause real and significant harm to the children does not suffice for the specific, good faith allegations required.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sufficiency of the evidence claims failed. The jury reasonably could have inferred from defendant's conduct, which included peering through the windows of a vehicle during the early morning hours in a well lit parking lot, pulling on the door frames and then striking the window with an object, that defendant had seen coats in the back of the vehicle and intended to steal the coats when he broke the window. Also, a witness, who had been in rightful possession of the vehicle prior to, during and following the incident, testified that defendant did not have her consent to enter the vehicle. Defendant's claim that the superior court improperly instructed the jury on an essential element of larceny in the sixth degree failed. The superior court's charge, when read as a whole, did not mislead the jury by relieving the state of its burden of proving all of the essential elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's constitutional challenges to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-125b(a) and 53a-121(a)(3) were briefed inadequately, and the court declined to review them.</SPAN></P>

The civil suit against the victim was filed from prison. Defendant argued that because the mailings concerned civil pleadings, the state failed to establish that they would cause annoyance or alarm to a person of common intelligence. The appellate court affirmed. While a common-law privilege generally attached to legal pleadings, defendant implicitly acknowledged that the mailings were not privileged if the jury could reasonably find that they contained collateral notations that would cause the victim annoyance or alarm in light of the underlying history between the parties. All of the mailings contained such collateral notations. Defendant's alternative claim that &sect; 53a-183 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him also failed. Defendant could not reasonably infer from the victim's failure to object to the civil pleadings that she would not likely be alarmed or annoyed by the extraneous comments attached to the mailings. Further, the fact that &sect; 53a-183 was a specific intent statute purged it of any potential vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Waterbury (Connecticut), which convicted him, following a jury trial, of burglary in the first degree, a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-101(a)(2), assault in the first degree, a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-59(a)(1), and assault in the first degree, a violation of &sect; 53a-59(a)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">None of defendant's claims were preserved at trial, and he sought to prevail under Connecticut v. Golding. The state appellate court affirmed. His claims that he was arrested without probable cause and that the &quot;show-up&quot; identification procedure was unduly suggestive were not reviewable because, while they were of a constitutional magnitude, the record was inadequate. The trial court made no factual findings or came to any legal conclusions respecting those claims. Further, defendant could not prevail on his claim that there was insufficient evidence to convict under &sect; 53a-59(a)(4) as he misconstrued the application of &sect; 53a-59(a)(4) to an accessory through Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-8. Convicting defendant as an accessory to assault was not to construe him as the &quot;he&quot; who actually inflicted hands-on injury while simultaneously construing the actual assailant to be a non-hands-on aider. Rather, defendant was punished as if he was the principal offender as his intent and willing assistance made him as culpable as the principal. Thus, one who was an aider for the purpose of establishing an element of the crime could also be liable as an accessory for giving such aid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction entered, after a retrial, by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Danbury (Connecticut) convicting him of conspiracy to commit robbery, robbery, and felony murder, and sentencing him to an effective term of 75 years of incarceration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his constitutional rights were violated by allowing the prior testimony of his brother to be entered into evidence. The appellate court considered the claim under Golding. Defendant's brother testified at the first trial, but refused to testify at the retrial. It was unclear whether the brother could assert his Fifth Amendment privilege as he had been sentenced for his participation in the crime. Thus, the brother was found to be unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes based on his refusal to answer any questions presented to him, which satisfied the unavailability requirement. It was not plain error to fail to instruct the jury, sua sponte, on the affirmative defense to felony murder outlined in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54c. There was evidence that defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that co-defendant was armed with a gun moments before entering the store. Finally, the jury was not improperly instructed on reasonable doubt as it was not reasonably possible for it to have been misled. The invitation to reject precedent from the state's highest court and to adopt the cumulative error standard used by the federal courts was declined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed judgments of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield (Connecticut), which convicted him of multiple offenses arising from four consolidated cases, including various types of murder and robbery. The trial court had denied defendant's acquittal motion. After merging various convictions, defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without release plus an additional term.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four separate incidents, defendant robbed two victims at gunpoint and took their vehicles, he fatally shot two other victims upon attempting to rob them, and he failed to stop for police. The charges were consolidated and a jury trial resulted in convictions and sentences. On appeal, the court found sufficient evidence to support the convictions with respect to defendant's identity and the operability of the gun as to the two robberies. Defendant's assertion of his right to waive counsel was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary pursuant to questioning under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 44-3, such that denial was proper. He was not unconstitutionally precluded from testifying in his own defense. The convictions for felony murder were properly based on the underlying offense of attempted robbery pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 42-29 (formerly &sect;&nbsp;867) and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;54-60. Defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated where he was sentenced for the felony murders and the capital felony, and for the larceny and retention of a vehicle. There was no separate offense under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;53a-136a, as it was merely a sentence enhancement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter to the extent of directing a combination of the two felony murder convictions with the capital felony, a vacatur of the sentences for the felony murder convictions and for the larceny by retention of stolen property, and a vacatur of the conviction under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;53a-136a. The remainder of the trial court judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions by the Superior Court, Judicial District of Waterbury (Connecticut), for attempt to commit murder and risk of injury to a child. Defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court improperly instructed the jury as to intoxication, failed to conduct an adequate inquiry as to juror misconduct, and improperly instructed the jury regarding attempt to commit murder and reckless assault in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant became upset when one of the victims told defendant she would not be able to take care of his daughter any longer. After drinking, defendant returned to the victim's house, argued with her, struck her, causing her to lose consciousness, and stabbed her. He &quot;chased&quot; the victim's 12-year-old daughter by running two or three steps toward her with a knife causing her to retreat to her bedroom. Approximately 25 minutes after having left the victims' house, defendant went to a police department and announced that he had just killed someone. The trial court gave an instruction on intoxication as framed by defendant. Thus, the appellate court held that defendant was precluded from claiming that the jury was improperly instructed as to intoxication. Even if there was error, it was induced. The trial court conducted a sufficient Brown hearing as to jury misconduct and defendant failed to demonstrate any prejudice. Contrary to defendant's assertions, the record reflected that the trial court did not emphasize the importance of the count asserting attempt to commit murder or minimize the importance of the count asserting reckless assault in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court, Judicial District of Windham at Danielson (Connecticut) granted the acquittee's motion to open the judgment and denied his motion to dismiss. The acquittee appealed, claiming, inter alia, that the admission of the board's report violated his procedural due process and the evidence did not support the court's findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acquittee was charged with the crimes of sexual assault in the fourth degree and risk of injury to a child. He was acquitted by reason of mental disease or defect pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-13. He was committed to the jurisdiction of the board. On subsequent occasions, the court granted the State's petitions for an order of continued commitment. The State filed a petition for an order for the acquittee's continued confinement. The board recommended that commitment be extended for a period of time not to exceed five years. The court granted the State's petition. The appellate court held the trial court was well within its authority to accept as true the prosecutor's representations concerning the existence of an agreement as to the admissibility of the board's report. Having effectively stipulated that the court properly could admit and consider the report, the acquittee induced the conduct that he challenged on appeal and was thus precluded from raising such claim under the doctrine of induced error. There was ample evidence to support the finding that the acquittee posed a significant danger to children as a result of his pedophilia.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent juvenile sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Tolland (Connecticut), which granted the request of petitioner, the Commissioner of Children and Families, to adjudicate the juvenile as a delinquent. He was found to have committed the crime of breach of the peace, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-181(a)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile, who was 13 years old at the time of the incident, was playing in his front yard with a pellet gun that was a replica of a .45 caliber handgun. The juvenile pointed it at a young girl across the street, who became upset. He was arrested and deemed a delinquent for having breached the peace, although another such charge and charges for brandishing a firearm resulted in not guilty findings. On appeal, the court initially noted that review was proper, as the appeal was not moot because if the delinquency adjudication was reversed, erasure of the juvenile's records pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-146 would then occur automatically. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, based on the juvenile's recklessness under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-3(13). The trial court properly inquired of the juvenile as to his complaints regarding his alleged communication breakdown with his court-appointed attorney. Further, the court-appointed guardian ad litem was properly instructed about her duties in representing the juvenile during the delinquency proceedings after she was appointed pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;45a-132.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that as defendant had been found to be competent to stand trial, he was competent to waive his right to a jury trial under the Federal Constitution. Between the time of the competency hearing and the trial, neither party raised any concerns about defendant's competency. When defendant waived his right to a jury trial, defense counsel stated that the waiver was against the advice of counsel, but did not raise defendant's competence to make such a waiver. The trial court recollected that defendant's behavior had been ordinary and that he had testified in a coherent manner. He was also familiar with the court system, had received a general equivalency diploma while incarcerated, and was represented by, and conferred with, counsel. Finally, the Connecticut Supreme Court had rejected defendant's claim that the canvass was inadequate under the State Constitution as he was not apprised of certain rights provided under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 that were not afforded under the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The appeals court disagreed. First, defendant failed to make a prima facie showing with regard to either prong of the selective prosecution test, and, as such, he was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing or a dismissal. Moreover, nothing in defendant's offer of proof indicated that he could have proven that his claimed &quot;suspect classification&quot; as a &quot;converter of property&quot; was an impermissible consideration for prosecution, which would be necessary to satisfy prong two of the selective prosecution test. Second, even if the State initially had sought to introduce evidence of some bad acts related to a police stop, it did not elicit such testimony or make any representations that defendant engaged in anything improper relating to this stop. Further, the defendant denied having been stopped. Hence, the court failed to see how these questions resulted in evidence of prior bad acts or how they were prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property was sold to the company by the daughter of a decedent. Prior to the decedent's death, the decedent and defendant had undertaken a number of improvements to the property. Defendant's lien was intended to secure payment for a portion of this work. The company argued that the lien was untimely, and that there was therefore no probable cause to sustain its validity. The appellate court held that the evidence presented, including defendant's testimony, his possession of keys to the premises, and a drawing that depicted work yet to be done, provided more than adequate support for the trial court's finding that the renovation project was ongoing at the time of the decedent's death. Thus, for purposes of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-34(1), the filing of the lien more than 90 days after the performance of some of the services did not compel a conclusion that the lien was untimely. The appellate court further held that service of the lien was proper, because &quot;owner,&quot; as used in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 49-34 and 49-35, meant only the owner at the time of service of the certificate of lien, and thus defendant was not required to serve the lien on the decedent's daughter.</SPAN></P>
