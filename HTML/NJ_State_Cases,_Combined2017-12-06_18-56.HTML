XIV to be free from state-created dangers. Because that right was clearly established at the time the lawyer was attacked, the state officials were not entitled to qualified immunity; [2]-Under the Bright v.

The high court held that because COAH was &quot;in, but not of,&quot; an Executive Branch department, the plain language of the  Reorganization Act, which extended the Chief Executive's authority only to agencies that were &quot;of the executive branch,&quot; N.J.S.A. &sect; 52:14C-3(a)(1), did not encompass, and thus did not authorize the Governor to abolish, an independent agency like COAH.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners owned land that was developed by prior owners subject to conditions of a duly recorded FWPA permit that controlled activities in certain areas of the property. The DEP became involved after a neighbor complained that the homeowners were placing fill and mowing vegetation in restricted areas. A DEP supervisor conducted various inspections and confirmed the activities in the protected areas. The DEP imposed an administrative penalty and ordered restoration. The homeowners filed various appeals and, for the first time in its appeal to the Court, raised the issue that the evidence collected by the DEP supervisor should have been excluded because he had not obtained an administrative search warrant. The court held that under the FWPA, a property owner receives the right to develop restricted land in exchange for giving the right of reasonable entry to the DEP to inspect. As such, the DEP supervisor lawfully entered the property. Further, the violations found were supported by sufficient evidence based on the aerial and other photographs, the homeowners' own admissions, and the disturbance of wetlands and the transition area.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff brought suit seeking reimbursement for costs incurred in repairing electrical lines damaged by defendants' excavation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While performing excavation work for the purpose of installing underground cables for the communications company, the utility company damaged plaintiff's underground electrical lines. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's suit for lack of jurisdiction, citing the mandatory alternative dispute resolution provision of the Underground Facility Protection Act, N.J.S.A. &sect; 48:2-80(d). The lower courts agreed that the case was subject to dismissal under &sect; 48:2-80(d). The Court found error, concluding that &sect; 48:2-80(d), as written, impinged on the constitutional right to a jury trial for property damages as it compelled parties seeking monetary relief for damages to underground facilities to submit such causes of action, if valued under a specified amount, to the Office of Dispute Settlement (ODS) for unspecified dispute resolution. The Court found that, on its face, the provision failed to preserve a party's ability to have the property damage dispute remain within or return to a judicial setting. The Court noted that neither it, nor the ODS, could write in a right to a trial de novo to save the statute from its constitutional shortcoming.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court reversed the judgment dismissing plaintiff's cause of action and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

During the plea colloquy, he acknowledged he would have to register. He was sentenced to three years probation and penalties, payments, and conditions were imposed. The trial court indicated that if defendant did all of those things, he would have no problem with the court. A judgment of conviction was entered that mirrored the orally-imposed terms. Defendant successfully completed his probationary sentence and was discharged from probation. More than seven years later, defendant was notified by the New Jersey State Parole Board that his sentence omitted the statutorily mandated community supervision for life provision. The trial court amended defendant's judgment of conviction to include community supervision for life. The Appellate Division concluded that amending defendant's judgment of conviction after he completed his sentence violated defendant's double jeopardy rights. The Court agreed, holding that while defendant's sentence was illegal because it omitted the statutorily mandated provision for community supervision for life, his sentence was completely served and was no longer subject to correction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court in that matter authorized the officers to search the premises for weapons. The officers conducted the search and found various weapons. A National Crime Information Center database search revealed one of the guns was stolen. Defendant was charged with several crimes, including possession of a loaded assault rifle and a stolen revolver. Defendant moved to suppress, arguing that the items found during the search conducted pursuant to a warrant issued under the domestic violence statute could not be used as evidence in a later criminal case. The lower courts agreed with defendant. The Court found error, concluding that items seized during a search conducted pursuant to a domestic violence warrant can serve as the basis for a subsequent criminal prosecution if their illegal nature is immediately apparent. The Court held that a check of the weapon's serial numbers is neither a seizure nor a search. As such, whether the officers could recognize immediately that the assault rifle and large capacity magazines were illegal to possess were factual determinations that had to be remanded.</SPAN></P>

Chapter 37 required the disclosure of nothing more than the fact that a driver was under 21 and was the holder of a special learner's permit, examination permit, or probationary license; the driver's age group was neither &quot;highly restricted personal information&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 2725(4), nor &quot;personal information&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 2725(3). Chapter 37 met federal and state equal protection standards, as it bore a rational relation to a legitimate state interest--ensuring that only those qualified to do so were permitted to operate motor vehicles--with minimal intrusion on the drivers subject to its provisions. Chapter 37 did not give rise to an unreasonable search and seizure under U.S. Const. amend. IV or N.J. Const. art. I, para. 7, because the young drivers subject to Chapter 37 had no reasonable expectation of privacy in their age group, and an officer's review of the decal did not constitute a search.</SPAN></P>

When police responded, a woman told them that there was no problem and that her young son was inside alone. Against her will, police entered her apartment to assure the boy's safety. He was unharmed, and there was no indication of a domestic disturbance. Police removed defendant from an adjoining room and patted him down; they found no weapons. They searched the area where he had been seated and found a handgun. The high court held that in responding to the 9-1-1 report of possible domestic violence, once the police officers found that there was inadequate evidence to corroborate the 9-1-1 report and determined that the parties' safety was not an issue, there was no objectively reasonable basis to search the residence under either the community-caretaking or emergency-aid exceptions to the warrant requirement and the evidence obtained through the warrantless search had to be suppressed. As to the emergency-aid exception, the test of State v. Frankel, 179 N.J. 586, was modified to remove as a factor the officer's subjective motivation for conducting the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court granted direct certification to defendant, the State of New Jersey, allowing it to appeal the judgment of the Superior Court, Mercer County (New Jersey), which held the Pension and Health Care Benefits Act (Chapter 78), L. 2011, c. 78, unconstitutional as applied to sitting justices and judges. Plaintiff judge filed a complaint and order to show cause initiating the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's suit sought a judgment declaring that Chapter 78 violated N.J. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6, para. 6 because it diminished the salary of justices and judges during their terms of service. Under Chapter 78, sitting justices and judges would be subject to a more than 400 percent increase in their pension contributions and a more than 100 percent increase in their health care contributions. Because the increased contributions were imposed without any corresponding salary increase, the take-home salaries of justices and judges would decrease in the range of $ 17,000 or more, representing a more than 10 percent decline in their disposable income. The trial court determined that Chapter 78 was unconstitutional. The trial court concluded that requiring justices and judges in service to make increased judicial contributions to the pension system, as set forth in Chapter 78, amounted to an unconstitutional diminution in judicial salaries. The trial court reached the same conclusion with respect to health benefits. The Court recognized that Chapter 78 served a legitimate public policy goal, but that goal, as applied to justices and judges, had to be achieved through constitutional means.</SPAN></P>

Defendant accelerated, drove several blocks, and abruptly stopped; the ex-boyfriend fell off, sustaining fatal injuries. The trial court charged the jury concerning passion/provocation manslaughter, &sect; 2C:11-4(b)(2). The high court held defendant's romantic involvement with the victim and their fight did not support this instruction, as there was no evidence defendant acted in a jealous rage or in the heat of passion. Section &sect; 2C:11-4(b)(2) did not violate equal protection, as the legislature could rationally conclude that aggravated manslaughter in violation of &sect; 2C:11-4(a)(1), requiring extreme indifference to human life, should be punished more harshly than passion/provocation manslaughter. The verdict sheet improperly directed the jury not to consider the passion/provocation issue unless it found defendant guilty of murder, but as there was no evidentiary foundation for a &sect; 2C:11-4(b)(2) instruction, the error was harmless. As defendant faced no imminent threat from the victim, the trial court's failure to sua sponte instruct the jury on self-defense was not plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived in a planned townhouse community that the association managed; its regulations banned all residential signs except &quot;For Sale&quot; signs. Defendant ran for town council and posted two signs in support of his candidacy at his home--one inside a window and another inside a door. The association notified him that the signs violated its rules, ordered their removal, and assessed a fine. He complied and removed the signs. The association filed the instant suit to collect maintenance fees and fines assessed for an unrelated matter. The high court noted that the free speech and assembly clauses in the New Jersey Constitution could be invoked against private entities because of the public use of their property. Balancing the minimal interference with the association's private property interest against defendant's free speech right to post political signs on his own property, the sign policy in question violated the free speech clause of the New Jersey Constitution, N.J. Const. art. I, para. 6. As the association's policy banning all political signs was unreasonable and unconstitutional, the covenant memorializing it was unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

The requestor filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs against the league, alleging a violation of the Open Public Records Act (OPRA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 47:1A-1 to 47:1A-13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The league was a nonprofit association representing all of New Jersey's 566 municipalities. It was created in 1915 by an act of the New Jersey Legislature. The requestor had sought particular documents from the league relating to certain fair housing regulations. The league declined to provide the requested documents on the ground that it was not covered by OPRA. Subsequently, the trial court determined that the league was not a public agency under OPRA, and the Appellate Division agreed. The Court held that the lower courts erred by denying the requestor relief because the league was a public agency under OPRA and was required to provide access to government records that were not subject to an exemption under OPRA. The Court determined that both lower courts went astray by importing into OPRA's definition of public agency the definition of a public body found in the Open Public Meetings Act, N.J.S.A. &sect; 10:4-6 et seq., and by misconstruing those two very different terms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was a Michigan based business and conducted all activities outside of New Jersey. The corporation earned income by licensing brand names that it owned and managed. The corporation did not file New Jersey tax returns or pay New Jersey's Corporate Business Tax (CBT) from 1996 to 2003. The Director calculated allocable income using information gleaned from related entities and issued the corporation a CBT deficiency assessment of nearly $ 25 million for those years using the Throw-Out Rule. The Appellate Division held that the Throw-Out Rule was constitutional and did not discriminate against interstate commerce. The Court agreed and held that for corporate taxpayers having a substantial nexus to New Jersey, the Throw-Out Rule may apply constitutionally only to untaxed receipts from states that lack jurisdiction to tax the corporation due to insufficient connection with the corporation or due to congressional action, but not to receipts that are untaxed because a state chooses not to impose an income tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was granted certification to appeal the denial of her petition for post conviction relief seeking a new sentencing hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was required to acknowledge that she would receive a 30-year prison sentence, concede that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, and agree that neither she nor her attorney would seek a lesser term of imprisonment. At defendant's sentencing, despite evidence in his possession suggesting that defendant suffered from Battered Women's Syndrome when she killed her husband, defense counsel offered no mitigating evidence in support of a lesser sentence. The court held that defendant was denied her constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel at sentencing. The court found that defense counsel deprived the court of mitigating evidence that was necessary for a meaningful sentencing hearing. Moreover, the court found that the constraints embedded in the terms of the plea agreement denied the trial court of arguments that may have shed light on relevant sentencing factors and how they should be weighed. Further, defense counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to challenge the unduly prejudicial video tribute to the victim scored to popular and religious music.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the Appellate Division, which affirmed the denial of defendant's petition for post-conviction relief.

The court further ordered a new sentencing hearing for defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff schoolchildren filed a motion under R. 1:10-3, seeking aid of litigants' rights based on defendant, the State of New Jersey, failing to fund the School Funding Reform Act of 2008 (SFRA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 18A:7F-43 to 18A:7F-63. The suit was a continuation of the litigation referred to as Abbott district cases wherein plaintiffs challenged the funding of schoolchildren in poorer school districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State had applied to the Court to be relieved of the ordered that required parity funding and supplemental funding for children in the so-called Abbott districts in exchange for providing funding to those districts under the SFRA. The Court granted the relief the State sought in Abbott XX. However, plaintiffs brought the underlying motion as a result of the State's failure to provide full funding under SFRA's formula to the Abbott districts. As such, the Court held that the State breached the very premise underlying the grant of relief it secured with Abbott XX. The Court held that the Appropriations Clause, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, para. 2, created no bar to judicial enforcement under the circumstances presented. The Court directed that the funding to the Abbott districts in Fiscal Year 2012 must be calculated and provided in accordance with the SFRA. The Court did limit the relief to the plaintiff class of children from Abbott districts for whom the Court had a historical finding of constitutional violation and for whom the Court has specific remedial orders in place through Abbott XX.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police relied on invalid arrest warrants when they set out to arrest defendant at his girlfriend's apartment.

The trial court found that the police had sufficient probable cause to arrest him and that his subsequent statements were given voluntarily. The Appellate Division affirmed that issue on different grounds, concluding that although defendant's arrest was unlawful, his statements were attenuated from the arrest. The Court affirmed for different reasons, finding that when defendant fled to a public area when the police arrived at the apartment, the police had sufficient probable cause to believe that he had committed a felony. Therefore, they did not need a warrant to arrest him in public. Further, the police had probable cause to arrest him for his conduct in resisting arrest, which they observed. As such, the defective arrest warrants played no role and the post-arrest statements were admissible.</SPAN></P>

The intermediate appellate court reversed the confirmation order because of the absence of a verbatim transcript of the arbitration proceedings. The high court held that the principles established in Fawzy were intended to be applicable to all child custody arbitrations, including those conducted under the APDRA. The record created by the arbitrator, which included a recitation of all evidence considered, a recapitulation of every interview and observation he conducted, a full explanation of the underpinnings of the award, and a separate opinion on reconsideration, satisfied the spirit of Fawzy and was an acceptable substitute for a verbatim transcript.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants summary judgment and dismissed the complaint as time-barred by N.J.S.A. &sect; 2A:14-2. The New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff asserted that she was given only an entry level nursing position, despite having a masters degree in nursing, and was not reclassified thereafter due to her race. She claimed she did not learn she was the victim of racial discrimination until two years after she resigned. The trial court held that her cause of action accrued when she resigned because she had a reasonable suspicion of racial discrimination at that time. The high court held that there was no equitable basis on which to extend the two-year statute of limitations on plaintiff's retaliation claim. That cause of action accrued at or before the date she resigned, after being told that if she had not complained, she may have been reclassified. However, a Lopez hearing was required to determine whether the discovery rule applied to the discrimination claim. When plaintiff requested reclassification, she was given a reason that had nothing to do with discrimination, which may have misled her into not pursuing the issue. She was entitled to assert that she had no reasonable suspicion of discrimination until two years after she resigned, when she learned about other claims of racial discrimination by employer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff's retaliation claim, but remanded the matter for a Lopez hearing with respect to the date of accrual of the racial discrimination claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner senator appealed the order of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which ordered respondent, the New Jersey Secretary of State, to accept a recall petition of the senator. Respondents, a recall committee and the New Jersey Director of the Division of Elections were also parties. At issue was the Uniform Recall Election Law (UREL), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 19:27A-1 to 19:27A-18, which implemented N.J. Const. art. I, para. 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New Jersey voters had approved the constitutional amendment that provided for the recall of any elected official in the State of New Jersey representing New Jersey in the United States Congress. The recall committee filed its recall petition with the Secretary, who rejected it for filing or review. The recall committee filed an application with the Appellate Division, seeking temporary injunctive relief and expedited review. The Appellate Division questioned the constitutionality of the UREL but did not pass on the ultimate validity of the recall process and ordered the Secretary to accept and file the recall petition and to proceed under the UREL. The Court determined that the case was ripe for adjudication and, upon analysis of the text and history of the United States Constitution, as well as the principles of the democratic system it created, held that the United States Constitution did not allow the states the power to recall United States Senators. The Court noted that it was only invalidating as unconstitutional the provisions of the UREL and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 2 that authorized the recall of United States Senators only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court reversed and vacated the Appellate Division's order directing the Secretary to accept the notice of intention to recall the senator. The Court invalidated as unconstitutional those provisions of the UREL and New Jersey's Constitution that authorized the recall of a United States Senator and struck those portions only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's petition for certification, allowing him to challenge the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which upheld a trial court's rejection of his challenges to the New Jersey Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 30:4-27.24 to 30:4-27.38.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that defendant's challenge to the SVPA was both a narrow and specific in that he asserted that the SVPA was unconstitutional as applied to individuals, like himself, who were committed pursuant to its terms when they were not provided with sex offender treatment while incarcerated for their underlying criminal sexual offenses. Defendant asserted that the SVPA was punitive, therefore, violating the federal and state ex post facto clauses under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 3, and that it was fundamentally unfair. The court analyzed the statute and various relevant case law and held that the SVPA was neither punitive nor unfair. The court held that the SVPA was remedial and regulatory in nature, and that its incidental effects, including the use of confinement as part of the treatment methodology, did not alter the essential character of the statute. The Court declined to conclude that the SVPA was transformed into a punitive, and therefore unconstitutional, enactment merely because it applied to some individuals, like defendant, who were not provided with specialized treatment prior to civil commitment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, defendant moved to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a warrantless search of a dwelling. After the trial court denied his motion, he pled guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery and two counts of felony murder. He then appealed; the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed. Defendant's petition for certification was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Investigating a car theft and murders, police found the car. The owner's cell phone was missing; police learned it had been used to call an apartment after the murders. An officer testified that an occupant of the apartment consented to their entry. Police swept the dwelling; seeing drugs in plain view, they arrested defendant and others. The high court held a protective sweep conducted on private property was not per se invalid merely because it did not occur incident to an arrest. Law enforcement officers could conduct a protective sweep only when 1) they were lawfully within private premises for a legitimate purpose, which could include consent to enter; and 2) they had a reasonable articulable suspicion that the area to be swept harbored an individual posing a danger. The sweep would be upheld only if it was conducted quickly and restricted to areas where the person posing a danger could hide. When an arrest was not the basis for entry, police had to point to dangerous circumstances that developed once they were at the scene. The evidence established that the entry was consensual and lawful, but questions remained as to the legitimacy of the investigative technique employed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court reversed and remanded the matter to the trial court for supplemental proceedings to determine whether the police entry could be shown to meet the directives contained in the high court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in municipal court of reckless driving; her driving privileges were suspended for 45 days under N.J.S.A. &sect; 39:5-31. The superior court, in a trial de novo, upheld defendant's conviction and imposed the same sentence. The the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed and set forth standards for the imposition of license suspensions under &sect; 39:5-31. Defendant's petition for certification was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed she did not receive &quot;fair notice&quot; that she was facing a potential license suspension and that &sect; 39:5-31 was unconstitutional. The high court held that the license suspension provision of &sect; 39:5-31, which was published in the Motor Vehicle Code of the New Jersey Statutes Annotated, was not &quot;hidden,&quot; and defendant, like all motorists, was presumed to know the law. To ensure that license suspensions meted out pursuant to &sect; 39:5-31 were imposed in a reasonably fair and uniform manner, so that similarly situated defendants were treated similarly, the high court defined the term &quot;willful violation&quot; contained in &sect; 39:5-31 to mean a deliberate violation of certain motor-vehicle statutes, and enunciated sentencing standards to guide municipal court and law division judges in determining whether to impose a license suspension under N.J.S.A. &sect; 39:5-31, and, if so, the length of the suspension. Having defined &quot;willful violation&quot; and having set standards to guide the discretion of judges imposing license suspensions, the high court concluded that &sect; 39:5-31 was neither vague nor overbroad, nor did it give unbridled discretion to sentencing judges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court reversed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court upholding the superior court's 45-day suspension of defendant's driving privileges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a high school student and her father and mother, filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against appellants, a board of education and its agents, alleging, inter alia, that the board violated the father's rights to free speech under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. A jury awarded the father damages. Appellants sought review; the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed. Appellants sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the public comment period of a board meeting, the board president denied the father the opportunity to complete a statement critical of both board policy and a high school coach he believed had verbally abused students, including his daughter. A jury found that the board did not have a compelling reason to justify silencing the father and awarded him damages. The high court held that, for purposes of &sect; 1983, the board president was acting as a final policymaker while presiding over the public comment period of the board meeting and therefore the board could be held liable for a violation of the father's First Amendment rights. In addition, the father presented sufficient evidence for the jury to determine that the board silenced him for no reason other than the unpopular viewpoint he expressed, in violation of his free speech rights. However, he offered minimal evidence of emotional distress and the damages award of $ 100,000 was so clearly excessive that it constituted a miscarriage of justice. Such a substantial award of damages for emotional distress had to be based on more than de minimis mental anguish, fleeting embarrassment, or mere shock and bewilderment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed that part of the intermediate appellate court's judgment that upheld the jury's finding that the board violated the father's First Amendment rights. It reversed the trial court's denial of a remittitur and remanded the case to that court for a remittitur hearing.</SPAN></P>

In ruling that the privilege applied, the trial court noted that the pastor reached out to defendant, that defendant had known him as a pastor for many years, that defendant desired to be baptized, and that the two had spoken in private. In reversing, the intermediate appellate court noted that the pastor had refused to counsel or baptize defendant. The high court held that the cleric-penitent privilege applied when, under the totality of the circumstances, an objectively reasonable penitent would have believed that a communication was secret, that is, made in confidence to a cleric in the cleric's professional character or role as a spiritual advisor. The record established that defendant's conversation with the pastor was privileged under this newly adopted test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sued defendant borough, challenging a tax assessment. The tax court affirmed the tax assessor's valuation and assessment of the taxpayer's property. The taxpayer appealed, challenging the constitutionality of N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:4-34. The New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, found &sect; 54:4-34 constitutional and affirmed the assessment. The taxpayer sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the taxpayer failed to respond to the tax assessor's request for information, he valued its property without its input. The taxpayer argued that the application of &sect; 54:4-34, mandating dismissal of a tax appeal if the taxpayer failed to respond to a request for information, violated its rights under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 12, because the difference between the tax bill issued and one informed by the taxpayer's tardy income information constituted an &quot;excessive fine.&quot; The intermediate appellate court held that &sect; 54:4-34 as applied did not result in the imposition of an unconstitutional excessive fine as 1) the tax bill was not a punishment, forfeiture, or civil sanction; 2) the tax court found the process of assessing the tax to be reasonable; and 3) the taxpayer was not assessed a penalty or additional tax for failing to comply with the request for information. The high court approved the judgment of the intermediate appellate court substantially for the reasons set forth in its thorough and thoughtful opinion. The statutory-appeal dismissal sanction did not violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment or the New Jersey Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The Appellate Division reversed following discovery, concluding that the exercise of jurisdiction over the manufacturer by New Jersey would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice and was justified under the stream-of-commerce plus rationale. The court agreed with the Appellate Division and reaffirmed a prior case law holding that a foreign manufacturer that places a defective product in the stream of commerce through a distribution scheme that targets a national market, which includes New Jersey, may be subject to the in personam jurisdiction of a New Jersey court in a product-liability action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted petitioner organization's petition for certification, allowing it to challenge the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which upheld a 2007 Directive from respondent, the New Jersey Attorney General, allowing exit polling within 100 feet of a polling place and that made other interpretations of New Jersey's elections laws, namely N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 19:34-6, -7, and -15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization challenged both the Attorney General directive, which required those conducting exit polling to register with election officials two weeks before an election, and the Attorney General's denial of the organization's request to distribute so-called voting-rights cards within 100 feet of a polling place. The Court disagreed with the Attorney General's analysis that the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, required an exception to be carved out of New Jersey's election-law statutes for exit polling, and only exit polling, in the 100-foot exclusionary zone. The Court held that N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 19:34-6, -7, and -15 direct that voters will have a 100-foot free, unobstructed passage to polling places, without interference from any person, and that the ban applied to all expressive activities within the 100-foot zone, including exit polling and handing out voting-rights cards. The Court held that the laws were constitutional because they were reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions under the First Amendment intended to secure and enhance another vital constitutional right, namely, the right to vote.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court modified and affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Division and held that New Jersey's election laws provided a comprehensive, non-discriminatory scheme for regulating the area within 100 feet of a polling place and banned all expressive activity, including exit polling and the handing out of voting-rights cards.</SPAN></P>

Co-defendant admitted that there was marijuana in the car, but told him it belonged to defendant. The officer arrested her for having a suspended license and Mirandized her. She waived her rights and revealed where the drugs were. The high court held that defendant's motion to suppress evidence found during a warrantless search of the vehicle in which he was riding should have been denied because he did not have standing to argue that co-defendant's right against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V was violated and because the search was not unreasonable under U.S. Const. amend. IV or N.J. Const. art. I, para. 7. The stop was justified by the absence of an inspection sticker. Defendant and co-defendant's inconsistent stories supported the officer's continued inquiries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State filed a motion seeking a declaration that the New Jersey School Funding Reform Act of 2008 (SFRA) satisfied the New Jersey Constitution and that, therefore, the State was released from prior remedial orders concerning public school funding in Abbott districts.

The State asked for elimination of the requirements that Abbott districts be provided parity aid and supplemental funding. Plaintiffs objected and sought to maintain the status quo. At an evidentiary hearing, the State's witnesses explained how the formula was created and how it would work. Plaintiffs' witnesses raised concerns about the adequacy of SFRA funding. The special master opined that SFRA was constitutional but recommended that supplemental funding continue to Abbott districts until the three-year look-back review of SFRA. To the extent that the record permitted its review, the high court held that SFRA was constitutional and could be applied in Abbott districts subject to the State continuing to provide school funding aid during the current and the next two years at the levels required by SFRA's formula each year, and subject further to the mandated review and retooling of the formula's weights and other operative parts after three years of implementation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff builders association sued defendant township, challenging a tree removal ordinance that required landowners to obtain a permit before removing certain trees on private land; to replant removed trees; and, if that was not feasible, to pay money into an escrow fund to be used to plant trees on public property. The trial court found the ordinance invalid; the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed. The township appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township adopted the ordinance under the general police power statute,&nbsp;N.J.S.A. &sect; 40:48-2. The intermediate appellate court agreed with the trial court that ordinance was not a valid exercise of police power; it held that the payment of a fee to plant new trees on public land did not further the ordinance's expressed objective of ameliorating the negative effects of removing trees on private property. It also affirmed the trial court's finding that the ordinance was impermissibly vague. The high court held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of police power because the details of the ordinance, including the tree replacement fee, the escrow fund, and the planting of trees and shrubs on public property when replanting at the original location was not feasible, were rationally related to the broad environmental goals that informed the ordinance. As the ordinance was an environmental regulation, not a planning or zoning initiative, it was not subject to the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 40:55D-1 to -163. The association did not prove that the fees assessed under the ordinance exceeded the township's administrative costs and thus were impermissible taxes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion on the grounds that this would violate the federal and state Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;, 10. cl. 1; N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, para 3. The New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed. The State sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the offense, under former N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:11-3(c), a defendant convicted of capital murder was subject to the death penalty if the jury found that one or more statutory aggravating factors were present and that they outweighed the mitigating factors. However, before the penalty phase of the trial, &sect; 2C:11-3 was amended to provide for a mandatory life-without-parole sentence in place of the death penalty if the State proved a single statutory aggravator. The high court held that because defendant had prior notice of the death penalty procedures in former &sect; 2C:11-3, there was no impediment to proceeding to the penalty phase under the former statute. If the jury concluded that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, rendering defendant subject to a death sentence under the former law, then imposing a life-without-parole sentence under the new law would not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. If the jury found in favor of a non-death sentence, defendant had to be sentenced under the law as it existed at the time of the offense, to a term of 30 years to life with a 30-year parole disqualifier.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To the extent the intermediate appellate court's holding entailed that defendant could not be sentenced to life without parole under any circumstances, even if the jury found that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, its judgment was reversed. The judgment was otherwise affirmed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court granted the State's petition for certification, allowing it to challenge the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which reversed defendants' convictions for felony murder, in violation of N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:11-3(a)(3), and other crimes. Defendants were tried together before a jury during a four-week trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions arose from their actions in killing a known drug dealer during a robbery. At the heart of the case was the trial court allowing the out-of-court statement of a witness to be introduced based upon it concluding that he was unavailable due to intimidation by defendants. The witness had been incarcerated and was taken to the courthouse in the same van as one defendant. When brought before the trial court to testify, he refused. Later, without placing the witness under oath, the trial court questioned him in camera, on the record, regarding the threats made to him. The court held that defendants' convictions required reversal based on the trial court improperly introducing the witness's statement. The court found that the trial court improperly examined the witness outside the presence of defendants and their counsel, took testimony without placing the witness under oath, and denied defendants the opportunity to present evidence to rebut the evidence of intimidation. The Court forwarded a recommendation that the New Jersey Legislature adopt a forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception to the hearsay rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Division reversing defendants' convictions. The court forwarded a forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception to the hearsay rule for inclusion in the New Jersey Rules of Evidence to the New Jersey Senate and the New Jersey General Assembly, for their approval by resolution, and to the New Jersey Governor for his signature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered the township to issue the necessary permits to operate the business upon finding that the township's zoning ordinance prohibiting sexually oriented businesses was unconstitutional. The trial judge ordered discovery and a plenary hearing regarding the pending challenge to N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:34-7. The business opened and, after months of settlement negotiations, the parties agreed to settle the challenge to &sect; 2C:34-7 by entering into a consent judgment whereby the township agreed to permit the business to continue to operate at its location. The township also enacted an ordinance that permitted sexually oriented businesses to operate only in a newly created zone that did not include the business's location. Subsequently, the business applied for a certificate of nonconforming use, which the township denied. The township thereafter initiated its challenge to the consent judgment under R. 4:50-1, asserting various grounds to be relieved from the same. The court held that no relief from the consent judgment was available to the township under R. 4:50-1(a), (b), (d), (e) nor (f). The court also held that the consent judgment was not violative of N.J.S.A. &sect; 40:55D-68.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted appellant inmate certification to challenge the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which affirmed a trial court order civilly committing him as a sexually violent person under New Jersey's Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 30:4-27.24 to -27.38. The State petitioned for civil commitment under the N.J.S.A. &sect; 30:4-27.26(b) standard. Defendant had been convicted of eight prior offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's convictions involved a pattern of unusual behavior toward his victims, including bondage. The trial court determined that six of the eight offenses were sexually violent offenses under &sect; 30:4-27.26(b). The State petitioned under &sect; 30:4-27.26(b) since none of appellant's convictions were for offenses listed in the SVPA. The case presented the first time the Court was being asked to approve the continued involuntary commitment of an inmate under &sect; 30:4-27.26(b). The court upheld appellant's commitment and concluded that, when faced with an application under &sect; 30:4-27.26(b), a court may consider the circumstances that led to the qualifying prior conviction and when that conduct was substantially equivalent to the sexually violent conduct encompassed by the offenses in &sect; 30:4-27.26(a), then that prior conviction might provide the predicate for a civil commitment application under &sect; 30:4-27.26(b). The court held that &sect; 30:4-27.26(b) must be read to confer additional authority to a court to determine an offense, not listed in &sect; 30:4-27.26(a) and which does not have substantially the same elements as an enumerated offense, to be, nevertheless, a sexually violent offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating a township's sign ordinance based on his role in the display of an inflatable rat. He appealed, alleging the ordinance violated his free speech rights under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, and N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed the conviction. Defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance banned most signs, including balloon signs or other inflated signs. Defendant, a union official in charge of a labor protest who ordered the display of the inflatable rat (a symbol of labor unrest) was convicted of violating the ordinance. The intermediate appellate court held the ordinance's ban on all inflatable signs other than grand opening signs was not a restraint on free speech, the ordinance was content-neutral, and it did not entirely prevent the union's message. The high court held the ordinance violated defendant's First Amendment right to free speech and was overbroad. As it prohibited the union from displaying a rat balloon, but authorized a similar display as part of a grand opening, it was a content-based restriction of non-commercial speech, and thus was subject to the most exacting scrutiny. Its goals--aesthetics, safety, and protection of property values--did not justify the restriction on speech. It was not shown to be necessary to serve a compelling state interest or to have been narrowly drawn to achieve that end. The ordinance's virtual elimination of an entire medium of expression without a readily available alternative rendered it overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for the entry of an order dismissing the summons issued to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4. Plaintiffs, minors and their guardians ad litem, filed a cross motion seeking an order to preserve the status quo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court had held that public school funding under N.J.S.A. ch. 212, as applied to &quot;special needs&quot; school districts (Abbott districts), violated the &quot;thorough and efficient education clause&quot; of N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4. The State was ordered to provide students attending Abbott districts with a constitutionally compliant education supported by adequate funding. Defendants sought a declaration that SFRA was constitutional, and that they could be relieved from the high court's remedial orders. Plaintiffs sought a declaration that those prior remedial orders remained in force. The high court held that the matter could not be resolved on an undeveloped record. The matter had to be remanded for further proceedings. In view of the history behind the enactment of  SFRA, the burden would be on defendants to prove that SFRA's funding formula provided sufficient resources to enable the Abbott districts to deliver a thorough and efficient education, as defined by the New Jersey Core Curriculum Content Standards. Plaintiffs would have the burden of proof on factual issues relating to their specific claims of current year inadequate school funding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The funds sought by the prosecutor were mostly for salary increases with some exceeding the previously agreed-to amounts in certain collective bargaining agreements.

The main issue on appeal was what standard the Assignment Judge was required to apply, namely whether a reasonably necessary standard applied or an appropriate standard. The court held that the plain words of &sect; 2A:158-7 authorized the Assignment Judge to approve expenses of the prosecutor that exceed the funds appropriated by the county only when those expenses were reasonably required by the prosecutor to fulfill the statutory responsibilities. As such, the Assignment Judge erred when he approved the salary increases after the prosecutor failed to establish that they were reasonably necessary or essential.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from being identified as the black male who raped a 40-year-old deaf and mute woman while she was walking home from a friend's house late at night. The appellate court concluded that it was inappropriate for the prosecutor to comment that because the victim was deaf and mute, she had a heightened sensory perception that made her identification of defendant more reliable, consequently violating defendant's right to a fair trial. In addition, the appellate court determined that the trial court infringed upon defendant's right to testify in his own defense by excluding his alibi testimony as a result of giving late notice of the same under R. 3:12-2, and that the exclusion of said testimony was not harmless. The court agreed with the appellate court upon concluding that the case did not present the rare circumstance that called for preclusion of defendant's alibi testimony for failing to comply with Rule 3:12-2. The court also noted that at any retrial, the prosecutor should neither argue facts that were not in the record nor expressly or implicitly vouch for the credibility of the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for certification filed by defendant juvenile, permitting defendant to challenge the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which upheld a family court's delinquency adjudication of defendant for an act, which if committed by an adult, would have constituted a second-degree robbery under N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:15-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The adjudication arose from defendant being identified as the juvenile who grabbed a woman's purse. An eyewitness spoke to an officer after the robbery. At trial, over defendant's objection, the family court permitted the officer to testify to the eyewitness's account as a present sense impression under N.J.R.E. 803(c)(1). The State explained that the witness refused to come to court. The Appellate Division affirmed defendant's adjudication of delinquency, finding that the family court properly admitted the non-appearing eyewitness's out-of-court statements through the officer as a present sense impression and as an excited utterance exception upon concluding that the witness had observed a startling event, a robbery, and reacted spontaneously and coincidently with the occurrence when he spoke to the officer. The court noted that the dispatcher to whom the eyewitness first had spoken was not called as a witness. The court held that the eyewitness's account was made approximately 10 minutes after the robbery and was not made while he was perceiving the event, as required by Rule 803(c)(1). As such, the family court erred by admitting the eyewitness's statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation imposed estate taxes on two decedents' estates under the amended version of N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:38-1. Plaintiffs, the executor and executrix of the estates, sought review. The tax court held that the doctrine of manifest injustice precluded applying the amendment version retroactively. The Director appealed; the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, reversed. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Congress amended the federal estate tax law effective January 1, 2002. To avoid revenue loss, New Jersey Legislature amended N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:38-1 on July 1, 2002, to provide that the New Jersey estate tax would continue to be computed in accordance with the federal state tax credit in effect on December 31, 2001. Section 54:38-1 was made retroactive to January 1, 2002. Both decedents died after January 1, 2002, and before the amendments to &sect; 54:38-1. Under the prior version of &sect; 54:38-1, the decedents' estates would have owed no taxes. The tax court and the intermediate appellate court both agreed that the amendment applied to the estates; the latter disapproved the former's application of the doctrine of manifest injustice to a tax statute. The high court held that the July 2002 amendment to &sect; 54:38-1 applied to the estates, but under the circumstances presented, the doctrine of manifest injustice barred retroactive application of the amendment to plaintiffs. The decedents reasonably relied on the previous law, and there was no showing that denial of retroactive application of the amendment to their estates would seriously impact New Jersey's revenues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's ruling that the amendment applied to the estates, reversed its ruling that the doctrine of manifest injustice did not bar the retroactive application &sect; 54:38-1(a)(2), and remanded the matter to the tax court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from the killing of a taxi cab driver. While defendant was incarcerated for another crime, two homicide detectives subjected him to a 95-minute interrogation, eliciting from him incriminating statements that linked him to the killing. Only then, for the first time, did the detectives advise defendant of his Miranda rights. Without any significant break, the detectives resumed the interrogation, questioning defendant nearly five more hours, taking two taped statements, which singly and together, directly connected him to the shooting death of the taxi cab driver. At defendant's trial, the State only sought to admit defendant's statements made after the initial 95-minute unwarned interrogation. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the statements he made after receiving the Miranda warnings. The court held that the question-first, warn-later interrogation procedure in the case violated defendant's State law privilege against self-incrimination. That privilege was rendered illusory because the detectives exploited defendant's admissions from the initial unwarned questioning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the stepmother of two children. The father, her husband, had devised a scheme to essentially disappear with the children and defendant to keep the children away from his ex-wife, with whom he had shared legal custody and, for a time, shared physical custody. At issue on appeal was whether defendant, as a stepmother, was guilty of non-consent kidnapping by removing the stepchildren from the state with the consent of their father, her husband, but without the consent of their mother. Defendant asserted that under the plain language of &sect; 2C:13-1(d), a parent cannot be guilty of kidnapping his own children and she, therefore, could not be guilty of kidnapping since she acted with her husband's permission. The court agreed with defendant that she was not subject to conviction under &sect; 2C:13-1(d) since her acts in removing the stepchildren were all pursuant to the consent of her husband. Further, since no allegations of force, threat, or deception were made against defendant, the conviction could not stand. The court noted that the interference with custody statute,&nbsp;N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:13-4(a), was applicable to the facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certification to respondent, an election winner, to challenge the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which reversed a trial court judgment dismissing the petition contesting the mayoral election of a township filed by petitioner challenger, pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 19:29-1 to -14, the election contest statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were opponents in the mayoral election. The challenger initially filed a verified petition, alleging that there were persons who were entitled to vote whose ballots had been rejected and that illegal votes had been permitted and counted. The challenger also alleged irregularities among the absentee ballots, mishandling of the same, and that some voters were provided wrongful assistance or were subjected to intimidation. The trial court had dismissed the petition upon the motion of the election winner, upon concluding that the challenger's amended complaint was insufficient to state a claim. The Appellate Division reversed, concluding that the election contest statute required interpretation in light of the modern rules of pleading. The court agreed with the Appellate Division's decision as to the sufficiency of the petition but disagreed as to its rationale. The court held that because N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:29-7 empowered only a court to compel a challenged voter to reveal his vote, no challenger would ever be able to overcome the inherent vagueness that existed until discovery was conducted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held a physician was not required to advise a woman that her non-viable embryo was a living human being to obtain her informed consent for an abortion and dismissed the lack-of-informed consent and NIED claims. The intermediate appellate court held that a jury issue remained concerning whether the doctor accurately answered the patient's question, &quot;Is the baby already there?&quot; The high court disagreed. Although the doctor had a common law duty to provide the patient with information about the medical risks of an abortion, there was no common law duty requiring him to instruct her that the embryo was an existing human being, and to suggest that an abortion was tantamount to murder.

The State had initiated the appeal of the trial court's suppression order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were travelling in two separate vehicles when one became disabled. On the basis of the nervousness of some defendants, the absence of a registered owner, and the suspicion aroused by the gas tank falling off, the troopers sought consent to search the disabled vehicle and found drugs under the hood. The trial judge determined that the troopers engaged in an unconstitutional investigatory detention and search as they were not premised on a reasonable and articulable suspicion and because a knowing and voluntary consent to search was not given. The appellate court, in deciding not to give any special deference to the trial judge's factfinding, reversed the suppression upon relying on the videotape and concluding that the troopers had the requisite suspicion. The court held that the appellate court improperly substituted its own factfindings for those of the trial judge, particularly based on the availability of the videotape, which did not extinguish the deference owed to the trial court's findings. Sufficient credible evidence was found to have supported the trial court's finding that the State fell short of showing that there was an articulable suspicion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The rules and regulations enacted by defendant at issue governed the posting of signs, the use of a community room, and access to its newsletter. Plaintiffs asserted that the rules and regulations violated New Jersey's constitutional guarantees of free expression. The trial court concluded that the restrictive covenants at issue regarding the posting of signs were reasonable, that plaintiffs were not denied access to defendant's newspaper, and that the rate charged for the community rule was impermissibly vague but upheld the amended policy of a unified rate charged for the community room. The lower court reversed upon concluding that defendant was subject to state constitutional standards with respect to its internal rules and regulations. The court, in applying the balancing test between expressional rights and privacy interests, held that the minor restrictions on plaintiffs' expressional activities were not unreasonable nor oppressive and that defendant was not acting as a municipality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a former public defender, sued defendants, a city, its mayor, and its council, asserting claims under New Jersey's Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 34:19-1 to -8, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court dismissed all but the &sect; 1983 claim against the mayor. The New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed dismissal of the &sect; 1983 claims but reversed dismissal of the CEPA claims. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff testified as a witness for the U.S. government in a political corruption trial of the city's municipal prosecutor; his testimony implicated the mayor in unlawful activity. The case ended in a mistrial; three days later, the mayor fired him as municipal public defender after more than 17 years of service. Plaintiff alleged this violated CEPA; his &sect; 1983 claim was based on his allegation that he was removed from office in violation of his First Amendment rights. The intermediate appellate court held that plaintiff was an &quot;employee&quot; for purposes of his CEPA claim and reversed the entry of summary judgment in favor of the city on that claim. It also held that the city could not be held vicariously liable for the mayor's actions on the &sect; 1983 claim. The high court held that under New Jersey's Faulkner Act, the mayor was the &quot;policy-maker&quot; for the city in respect of plaintiff's removal as municipal public defender; therefore, the &sect; 1983 claim against the city based on his actions should not have been dismissed. Also, plaintiff set forth a prima facie case that, as municipal public defender, he was an &quot;employee&quot; of the city for purposes of advancing his CEPA claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's reversal of the entry of summary judgment in favor of the city on plaintiff's CEPA claim, but reversed its decision affirming the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's &sect; 1983 claim against the city. It remanded the matter to trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury acquitted defendant on an obstruction charge. The convictions against defendant arose from a call reporting possible drug activity and the subsequent investigatory stop of defendant from which he fled. The pursuit that ensured did not last long since defendant stumbled and fell. After arresting defendant, a handgun was found tucked in his waistband. The appellate court reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress upon finding that the dispatch received from police headquarters, standing alone, did not provide the officers with a reasonable and articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The appellate court also determined that defendant had a right to refuse to participate in the State's unlawful dominion over him. The court found error, concluding that defendant's resistance to the pat down and flight from the police was an intervening act, particularly the crime of obstruction, that completely purged the taint from the unconstitutional investigatory stop.</SPAN></P>

The owners appealed; the trial court and the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, upheld the borough's redevelopment designation. The owners sought further review, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 40A:12A-5(e) as applied to their land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land was mostly undeveloped open space and protected wetlands. It was zoned as a marine industrial business park, and portions of it were used for river access, employee parking, storage, and for growing cattle feed. At a hearing held by the borough's planning board, one of the owners testified that they also sought to resume using the land as a dredging depot. As part of its master plan, the borough classified the land as &quot;in need of redevelopment&quot; under N.J.S.A. &sect; 40A:12A-5(e), on the basis that its unimproved condition rendered it &quot;not fully productive.&quot; The high court held that because N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, para. 1, authorized government redevelopment of only &quot;blighted&quot; areas, the legislature did not intend N.J.S.A. &sect; 40A:12A-5(e) to apply in circumstances where the sole basis for redevelopment was that the property was &quot;not fully productive.&quot; Rather, &sect; 40A:12A-5(e) applied only to areas that, as a whole, were stagnant and unproductive because of issues of title, diversity of ownership, or other similar conditions. Moreover, the record was silent as to whether the borough considered the benefits the land's freshwater wetlands status conferred on the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, various community hospitals, were also parties to the action.

Appellants argued that the call under N.J.A.C. 8:33-3.11(e) was ultra vires principally because it authorized, as a demonstration project, a procedure that was expressly prohibited by other regulations. The court determined that although &sect; 8:33-3.11(e) authorized the call, the regulation, as applied, violated fundamental principles relating to the regulatory process. As such, the court was unable to sustain the grant of the CNs for the Atlantic C-PORT-E study. The court directed that the projects could continue through November 30, 2007. The court further directed that a proper regulation must be promulgated, after appropriate adherence to the principles of rulemaking, before any such demonstration project could be continued beyond that date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from the home invasion and murder of an elderly couple. The State had served notice of aggravating factors as a prerequisite for the imposition of the death penalty, asserting that the murder of the male victim was committed while defendant was engaged in robbery and/or burglary and that it was committed for the purpose of escaping detection. The same aggravating factors were alleged as to the female victim. The court rejected defendant's claims that the State was permitted to introduce vast amounts of inflammatory evidence since the evidence, such as defendant's statements to the police, a picture of the murder scene, defendant's underlying crimes, and defendant's past criminal history, were all relevant in the penalty phase trial regarding aggravating and mitigating factors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree aggravated sexual assault (N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:14-2(a)), aggravated assault, theft, terroristic threats, and four counts of first-degree carjacking (N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:15-2) and first-degree kidnapping. The Superior Court, Appellate Division, modified the first-degree sexual assault conviction to second-degree but rejected defendant's Natale challenge to his carjacking and kidnapping sentences. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a car occupied by four teenagers trying to buy marijuana. He directed them to a house, which he and a passenger entered. He raped her in the house. They returned to the car; he ordered the driver to let him drive, and drove around for about 45 minutes. He refused the victims' requests to leave the car, but they escaped after he stopped the car and left. The high court noted that carjacking was not an offense listed in N.J.S.A. &sect; 2C:14-2(a)(3) that elevated a sexual assault to a first-degree aggravated sexual assault. Although robbery was such a predicate offense, robbery and carjacking were dissimilar in many respects. Further, the legislative history indicated that carjacking was not intended to be a predicate offense under &sect; 2C:14-2(a)(3). Therefore, the intermediate appellate court properly reduced defendant's conviction to second-degree sexual assault (albeit for a different reason). When defendant was sentenced, former N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-1f(1)(a) provided for a 20-year presumptive term for kidnapping. As his 25-year sentences for kidnapping exceeded the formerly-established presumptive term for that crime, his sentence was illegal under State v. Natale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed modification of the first degree sexual assault conviction to second-degree sexual assault. It reversed the ruling that the kidnapping sentence was not entitled to a Natale remand. It ordered the trial court to impose a sentence for second-degree, not first-degree, sexual assault; to convict defendant of third-degree aggravated assault; and to resentence him under Natale for kidnapping and third-degree terroristic threats.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the New Jersey Highway Authority, and respondent, a township, both were granted interlocutory leave to appeal the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which summarily upheld a tax court ruling that determined that the Authority's reception center and amphitheater were both subject to real property taxation for 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2004, and that, for 1996, only the reception center was taxable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Authority completed constructed of the PNC Bank Arts Center, formerly known as the Garden State Arts Center, in 1968, which consisted of an amphitheater. The New Jersey Legislature investigated the operation of the Authority, which resulted in the Legislature amending the definition of a highway project under L. 1968, c. 348, &sect; 1, to include only those facilities directly related to the use of highways. The continued operation of existing facilities or activities by the Authority were not affected by the provisions of the amendment, therefore, the operation of the amphitheater was statutorily established as a highway purpose. However, the reception center did not exist in 1968 but was established in 1972 as a for-profit facility. The court held that because the operation of the amphitheater furthered the Arts Center's original purposes of providing public access to performing arts and generating revenue, it was exempt from local property taxation. However, because the construction and privatization of the reception center were dramatic, unanticipated departures from the Authority's statutory mandate, the reception center was subject to taxation for all years under appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, in part, the judgment holding that the amphitheater and attendant facilities were subject to taxation. The court affirmed, in part, the judgment holding the reception center was taxable. The court remanded the case for an assessment of the Authority's tax liability consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two tax sale certificate holders, were granted certification to challenge the judgment of the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Cape May County (New Jersey), which permitted respondent investor to intervene and approved the redemption of the tax sale certificates. The holders had each filed an action to foreclose on their respective tax certificates against respondent property owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holders had purchased their respective tax sale certificates. After a search of public records, the investor learned of the foreclosure complaints and contracted with the property owners to purchase the respective lots at issue. The property owners delivered a cashier's check to the tax collector's office to redeem the tax sale certificates after closing on the lots with the investor. The tax collector accepted the redemption checks in each case but the holders refused to surrender their respective certificates and filed motions to bar redemption. In response, the investor sought to intervene in the actions. The court held that the Tax Sale Law, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;54:5-1 to -137, did not prohibit a third-party investor from redeeming a tax sale certificate after the filing of a foreclosure action, provided that the investor timely intervened in the action and paid the property owner more than nominal consideration for the property. The court did not find that the investor's actions violated public policy as well as agreed that the investor paid more than nominal consideration to the property owners. However, by failing to intervene, the investor violated N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;54:5-89.1 and -98.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The court imposed constructive trusts in favor of the property owners, granting the tax certificate holders the opportunity to assume the investor's contractual rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty to possession of a controlled dangerous substance, defendant was ordered to submit a biological sample for DNA testing and storage under N.J.S.A. &sect; 53:1-20.20(g) of the New Jersey DNA Database and Databank Act of 1994, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 53:1-20.17-20.28.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Act, which required all persons convicted of a crime to give a DNA sample, violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and N.J. Const. art. I, paras. 1 and 7. The high court disagreed. Applying the special needs test, it found that mandatory DNA testing extended beyond ordinary law enforcement and presented a &quot;special need&quot; that justified privacy intrusions absent individualized suspicion. Therefore, requiring defendant to provide a DNA sample without a warrant did not violate the Fourth Amendment or N.J. Const. art. I, para 7. As to defendant's equal protection challenge, the Act was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest of having a data bank of DNA to solve future crimes, exonerate the wrongfully convicted, and deter crime. All similarly situated individuals -- those convicted of a crime -- were required to provide a DNA sample. Due to the impracticality of imposing a warrant requirement, the overriding public need for DNA data, a convicted felon's lessened expectation of privacy, and the minimal nature of the physical intrusion (a swab of the person's cheek), defendant's constitutional rights to equal protection were not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff same-sex couples sued defendant state officials seeking a declaration that New Jersey laws banning same-sex marriage violated the liberty and equal protection guarantees of N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1, and injunctive relief compelling the officials to grant them marriage licenses. The trial court granted the officials summary judgment. The New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed. The couples sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The couples, who had been in permanent, committed relationships for more than 10 years, were denied marriage licenses. The high court agreed with the lower courts that New Jersey's marriage statutes did not violate N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1's substantive due process guarantees, but found that they violated its equal protection provisions. While age-old traditions, beliefs, and laws defined marriage to be between a man and a woman, attitudes had changed, as evidenced by statutes and court rulings banning differential treatment based on sexual orientation. Even after enactment of the New Jersey Domestic Partnership Act, L. 2003, c. 246, many of the rights and benefits accorded to married couples were denied to committed same-sex couples. The officials did not articulate any legitimate public need for depriving same-sex couples of the host of benefits and privileges of marriage. To remedy the constitutional violation, the legislature could either amend the marriage statutes to include same-sex couples or enact a parallel statutory structure by another name, in which same-sex couples would enjoy the rights and benefits and bear the burdens and obligations of civil marriage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court affirmed the intermediate appellate court's ruling that New Jersey's marriage laws did not contravene N.J.

Within 180 days, the legislature had to either amend the marriage statutes or enact a statutory structure that afforded committed same-sex couples the same rights of married couples.</SPAN></P>

Virginia. After the trial court devised procedures and burdens of proof for evaluating this claim, New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, reversed the trial court's pre-trial procedures but affirmed its order regarding the guilt phase proceedings. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to sexually assaulting and murdering a 10-year-old boy; his DNA matched DNA found on the victim's clothes. The trial court ruled that if defendant proved at a pretrial hearing, by clear and convincing evidence, he was retarded, he could not be executed. If he established his retardation by a preponderance and was found guilty of murder, the State had to disprove retardation beyond a reasonable doubt at a sequential trial in order for defendant to be eligible for execution. The intermediate appellate court held that the State had the initial burden to prove to the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was not retarded. The high court disagreed. The jury had to first consider whether defendant was guilty of capital murder beyond a reasonable doubt; he could raise the issue of retardation to negate an element of the crime. If the jury found him guilty, it considered whether a statutory capital trigger existed beyond a reasonable doubt. If so, defendant had to prove he was retarded by a preponderance of the evidence to avoid execution under Atkins. If he failed to do so, he could still raise his mental retardation as a mitigator during the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certification was granted to petitioner, the Director of the Division of Taxation, to challenge the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which reversed a judgment in the Director's favor interpreting the retaliatory tax statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:32-15, and the premium tax cap statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:18A-6. Plaintiffs, three foreign insurance companies, filed suit challenging the Director's interpretation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit arose from the Director rejecting the insurance companies' respective applications for taxes paid when the premium cap was not applied originally in their calculations. The Director had interpreted the two statutes based on a plain reading of their language and independently of each other. Under the Director's interpretation, although an insurer's payment of the premium tax was capped, the Director's application of retaliatory tax raised the insurer's total tax obligation to a point that equated to a foreign state's rate. Therefore, a foreign insurer effectively received no benefit from the premium tax cap. The court held that the Director's interpretation lead to an unreasonable result that the New Jersey Legislature could not have intended. The court found that the Director's interpretation of the premium tax cap provided no incentive for foreign insurers to conduct business in New Jersey because the retaliatory tax fully recaptured any benefit provided by the premium tax cap. Likewise, the Director's interpretation failed to promote the retaliatory tax statute's purpose of encouraging even-handed treatment of insurers between states.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court on statutory grounds and instructed the Director to recalculate refunds due to the insurance companies in accordance with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant school's motion for leave to appeal the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which reversed the trial court's dismissal of the claims of plaintiffs, a former student and his wife. Plaintiffs brought suit against the school and defendants, its musical director and others, based on the Child Sexual Abuse Act (CSAA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:61B-1, negligent hiring/supervision, and other claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former student asserted that when he was a 12-year-old residential student at the school, its musical director repeatedly sexually abused him and that the school knew, or should have known, of the abuse. Plaintiffs also sought damages based on intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, breach of the duty to disclose the abuse, active concealment of the abuse, assault and battery, false imprisonment, and loss of consortium. The trial court granted summary judgment dismissal to the school, finding that plaintiffs' claims were barred by the Charitable Immunity Act (CIA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;2A:53-7 to -11. The lower court reversed upon concluding that the CIA did not bar suits based on intentional conduct. The court agreed and held that, under the CSAA, a school was a person standing in loco parentis within a household and that the CIA did not bar statutory or common-law claims based on willful, wanton, or grossly negligent conduct. The discovery rule provisions of the CSAA were held to apply to common-law claims based on sexual abuse, and the court also held that an employer could be held vicariously liable for the acts of its employees for child abuse claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Modifying the lower court judgment by holding that plaintiffs were permitted to pursue a statutory cause of action and any common-law claims of sexual abuse based on intentional conduct, the court affirmed the judgment, as modified. The court remanded the case to the trial court for it to determine whether the two-year statute of limitations under the CSAA was tolled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery, unlawful possession of a weapon, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and possession of a weapon by a prohibited person. He was designated a persistent offender, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-3, and sentenced to 40 years with a 16-year parole ineligibility component. The Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), affirmed the convictions and sentence, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said his persistent offender sentencing involved impermissible judicial fact-finding. The supreme court held the sentencing court did not engage in impermissible fact-finding by assessing a record of convictions and finding him statutorily eligible for a discretionary extended term as a persistent offender. Required findings of a &quot;need to protect the public,&quot; before imposing an extended term, had to be made after he was found to be a persistent offender, which exposed him to a range from the minimum ordinary sentence to the maximum enhanced sentence. Considering objective facts about his prior convictions did not violate the Sixth Amendment. He was subject to the extended-term range under Blakely's prior-conviction exception. His sentence had to be reconsidered due to the expanded range he was exposed to, considering aggravating and mitigating factors. A &quot;need to protect the public&quot; could be judicially found once defendant was eligible for an enhanced sentence. He was not subjected retroactively to a &quot;new&quot; statutory maximum that only a jury could impose. He could not receive a sentence in excess of the prior one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers on patrol received a dispatch from headquarters that a person was armed with a gun outside a bar. Minutes later, near the bar, the officers sighted a man matching the description given in the dispatch and ordered him to stop for questioning. Instead, the man, later identified as defendant, ran. After an intense pursuit, the officers arrested defendant. Defendant claimed on appeal that, because the officers engaged in an unconstitutional investigatory stop, the officers were not lawfully performing an official function and, therefore, he should have been found not guilty. The court disagreed and held that substantial credible evidence existed in the record to support the findings of the trial court that the officers ordered defendant to stop for questioning and that defendant clearly understood that command, but ran. Upon examining the language of the sister statutes involving resisting arrest, eluding, and escape, the court determined that the New Jersey Legislature intended that, when a police officer was acting in good faith and under color of his authority, a person had to obey the officer's order to stop and could not take flight without violating &sect; 2C:29-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, which upheld defendant's conviction of obstruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to capital murder and was sentenced to death. The Superior Court, Law Division, Essex County (New Jersey), denied defendant's second post-conviction relief petition. Defendant appealed, arguing that his death sentence should be vacated because, had the penalty and the proportionality reviews been combined, a majority of the state supreme court would have voted to overturn his death sentence and impose a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court concluded that although defendant's petition would be barred under the five-year limitation of N.J. Ct. R. 3:22-12 because he filed it on August 1, 2003, which was more than 10 years after the trial court's February 5, 1993, death sentence, defendant's petition was not barred because his failure to file it before the expiration of the time limit was due to excusable neglect and barring his petition would result in an injustice under N.J. Ct. R. 1:1-2. Also, because both the penalty and proportionality reviews determined whether a death sentence had been properly imposed, the two reviews were not distinct but rather different aspects of the same consideration--whether there was error in the imposition of the death penalty. Defendant's death sentence had to be vacated and a life sentence imposed because the death sentence pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3 was upheld only because the penalty review was separated into two proceedings, not because a majority of the state supreme court believed that imposition of the death sentence was proper. Four Justices found that the death sentence was improperly imposed and that defendant should receive a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed the trial court's denial of defendant's petition for post-conviction relief, vacated defendant's death sentence, and remanded the case to the trial court for imposition of a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

The Act authorized probation officers to be armed and make arrests and effectively changed their status from judicial personnel to law enforcement officers. The Administrative Director's complaint sought a judgment declaring the Act violated the New Jersey Constitution by infringing on the exclusive powers of the judiciary under N.J. Const. art. VI and by breaching the separation of powers under N.J. Const. art. III. The complaint alleged that the Act invested probation officers with law enforcement powers, which were incompatible with their judicial roles and placed them under the dual supervision of the Court and the Attorney General. The Court wholly agreed with the lower court's decision that the Act violated its constitutional authority over the administration of the courts and breached the separation of powers between the judicial and legislative branches of government since it directed the judiciary to assign probation officers to serve in a law enforcement capacity, subjected those officers to the supervision of the executive branch, and required the Administrative Director to report to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for certification filed by appellant township with regard to the township's challenge of the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which affirmed a trial court decision finding the township had violated 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Respondent activist had brought the &sect;&nbsp;1983 suit against the township and appellant township attorney, challenging a sequestration motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a case before an administrative law judge (ALJ), the township attorney filed a motion for sequestration, seeking to have the activist removed from the proceeding. The attorney asserted that the activist was a potential witness, although neither party had listed him on their witness lists nor subpoenaed him. The ALJ issued a sequestration order against the activist. The activist voluntarily withdrew upon the threat of the attorney seeking a trial court order to enforce the sequestration ruling. The lower courts held that intentional lying to the ALJ to exclude the activist was not privileged conduct. No damages were awarded to the activist, but the township was permanently enjoined from interfering with the activist's attendance at future public hearings and the activist was awarded attorney fees as the prevailing party. The court held that the sequestration motion was a communication within a proceeding that was covered by the litigation privilege afforded to attorneys and parties. In addition, the attorney's role as special counsel for the township at the administrative hearing did not transform him into a municipal policymaker under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress based on the claim of an illegal stop, acquitted him of driving while intoxicated, and convicted him of refusal to take a breathalyzer test in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50.4a. Defendant appealed; the law division affirmed, as did the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division. Defendant's petition for certification was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supervisor of a sobriety checkpoint told officers to stop any motorist making a turn within the checkpoint zone; defendant was stopped after making such a turn. His eyes were glassy and his speech was slurred, he failed two out of three psycho-physical sobriety tests, and he said he had two glasses of wine. He refused to take a breathalyzer test. The appellate division held that while police failed to provide adequate warning to motorists that a turn would provide cause for a stop, defendant's refusal to submit to the test was an independent act free of any taint from the invalid stop. The State did not appeal the ruling that the stop of defendant's car was illegal but argued that the refusal offense was so attenuated from the unconstitutional stop that the exclusionary rule did not apply. The supreme court disagreed. The police officer's observations at the scene of the illegal stop were necessary to prove an essential element of the crime of refusal to take a breathalyzer test: that the officer had probable cause to believe defendant drove while intoxicated. Because this evidence had to be suppressed, the State could not prove a violation of the refusal statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the appellate division and remanded to the law division for the entry of an order consistent with the instant opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client had filed a grievance against the attorney. During the DEC investigation, the attorney admitted specific acts of misconduct in connection with her representation of the client. Pursuant to established procedures, the DEC Chair reviewed the matter and determined that the attorney was eligible for diversion because her ethical violations were minor. Thereafter, the DEC informed the client that, although the attorney had accepted diversion, the matter remained confidential under Rule 1:20-9(a). The client contended that the rule was an impermissible restraint on free speech because it prevented her from making truthful statements about the ethics process, including the fact that she filed a grievance, and unduly suppressed criticism of the system of attorney discipline. The court agreed that Rule 1:20-9 violated the First Amendment because it was not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. As such, the court held that a grievant was permitted to discuss publicly the fact that he or she filed a grievance, the content of that grievance, and the result of the process. The court also applied its holding retroactively to all grievances being processed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Jersey Appellate Court entered a judgment that affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for post-conviction relief where a jury convicted defendant of second-degree passion/provocation manslaughter and acquitted him of various gun-related offenses but the trial court nevertheless enhanced defendant's sentence after finding he committed the crime with a handgun, a fact not found by the jury. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of second-degree manslaughter and acquitted him of various gun-related offenses. The trial court found that defendant committed the crime with a handgun. Because that finding made defendant a second-time offender under the Graves Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-6(c),(d) (Graves Act), the trial court imposed on him an extended sentence of 20 years in prison. As a result, he received a sentence twice as long as the maximum 10-year second-degree sentence. Eventually, the appellate court affirmed the denial of his post-conviction relief petition. On appeal, he claimed that the imposition of a sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on judicial factfinding violated his Sixth Amendment jury trial and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. The state supreme court agreed. It found that the second-offender provision of the Graves Act, which permitted the imposition of the extended term based on judicial factfinding that he committed the crime with a handgun even though the jury did not make that specific finding, violated Apprendi because it allowed the sentencing judge to enhance his sentence based on something other than the required prior conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's judgment that affirmed the denial of defendant's postconviction relief petition was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's petition and defendant's cross-petition for certiorari after the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, reversed a sentence imposed on defendant convicted of aggravated assault after remand that equaled his originally imposed sentence and held that the sentencing process in which aggravating and mitigating factors were balanced under N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New Jersey's sentencing scheme provided for statutory maximums and minimums but also referenced presumptive sentences, which fell somewhere in between. After defendant was convicted of beating his girlfriend nearly to death, the trial court, following statutory procedures, applied &sect; 2C:44-1's aggravators and mitigators to the presumptive sentence and sentenced defendant to a long term. Since the trial court had based its determination on something other than the statutory maximum, the court held that the intermediate court had properly held the process violative of the Sixth Amendment as articulated in Blakely. Nonetheless, the intermediate court erred in holding the whole scheme unconstitutional when it was possible to salvage the statute by eliminating one provision and thereby effectuate the legislative intent of assuring uniformity in sentencing. The court eliminated presumptive sentences and directed that the maximum statutory sentences should guide courts in applying aggravating and mitigating factors. This new rule was to apply prospectively, to all cases pending appeal, and to any cases in which Blakely concerns had been raised.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With regard to her second conviction, defendant claimed that her first offense was uncounseled and moved to limit any period of incarceration to that of a first-time offender in accordance with the caselaw. The trial court in that case granted her motion and sentenced her as a first-time offender without any period of incarceration. In the present case, defendant moved for sentencing as a second-time offender since she was sentenced as a first-time offender with regard to her second conviction. Defendant was sentenced as a third-time offender to 90 days in jail with 90 days of community service, fines, surcharges, penalty costs, and a 10-year suspension of her driving privileges. The court examined the caselaw at issue and held that, to fulfill the legislative intent, the DWI statute for a third-time offender with one prior uncounseled DWI conviction allowed for the imposition of incarceration no greater than that for a second-time offender, namely 90 days, and allowed for the imposition of the second-time offender requirement of 30 days of community service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), upheld a jury verdict against appellant injured party and found N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2B:23-17, which authorized parties in a civil action to stipulate that a smaller majority of jurors than five-sixths could render a verdict. The injured party argued that &sect; 2B:23-17 was unconstitutional because it conflicted with N.J. Const. art. I, para. 9, and acknowledged that while she did not raise that argument below, the argument was raised sua sponte by the dissent in the appellate division. She further alleged the 75 percent jury verdict was plain error within the meaning of N.J. Ct. R. 2:10-2. The instant court disagreed. Both the right to a jury trial and the right to a jury verdict of not less than five-sixths majority were provided for in N.J. Const. art. I, para. 9, and there was no reason to distinguish between the right to waive a jury trial entirely and the right to waive a jury verdict by five-sixths majority. Further, civil parties could waive their constitutional right to at least a five-sixths verdict and agree to accept a smaller percentage verdict. Thus, the injured party's plain error argument was rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In municipal court, defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test, in violation of the New Jersey Refusal Statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50.4; he appealed. The superior court, law division, affirmed, as did the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division. Defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant for illegally crossing the center line of traffic. Based on his observations, the officer arrested defendant for driving under the influence of an intoxicant. The officer read to defendant the statement required under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50.2(e) and twice requested that he submit to a breathalyzer test. Defendant twice refused. Defendant argued that the Refusal Statute's preponderance-of-the-evidence burden of proof violated his due process rights and was unconstitutional. The lower courts disagreed, but the supreme court did not. It had previously held that, for double jeopardy purposes, a prosecution under the Refusal Statute was quasi-criminal in nature. It extended that reasoning; in prosecutions under &sect; 39:4-50.2(e), the State had to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The new rule was to be given &quot;pipeline retroactivity,&quot; that is, it applied in the instant case, in future cases, and in any case still on direct appeal at the time the new rule was set forth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appellate division was reversed and the matter was remanded the municipal court, where defendant could elect either to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial under the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard of proof, or to accept his earlier conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certification to the State's request for further review of a judgment of a panel of the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, that affirmed defendant's theft and forgery convictions but held that harmless error had occurred and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 7 had been violated when defendant's bank records were released to investigators pursuant to a grand jury subpoena without a showing of probable cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Investigators had already been alerted by a check register found in an inventory search of defendant's purse to the likelihood that her bank records would provide evidence that she had stolen from her elderly employers. Her bank records were obtained by grand jury subpoena for which the prosecutor needed only to show relevance to the investigation. The court agreed with an intermediate court that N.J. Const. art. I, para. 7 was more protective than the Fourth Amendment of financial records in the possession of third parties. Even though New Jersey law recognized that defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy, the court held that her expectation was adequately protected by the requirement that relevancy (rather than probable cause) support issuance of a subpoena. Although the constitution did not require it, the court recognized that some targets of investigation would not be adequately protected if their bank records could be seized without their knowledge. Since it had supervisory powers over grand juries, it directed the appropriate committee to study whether it would be appropriate to include a requirement that targets be notified of third-party subpoenas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the intermediate court's holding that defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in her bank records but reversed its holding that a probable cause standard applied, holding instead that grand jury procedures were adequate. Finally, it referred the issue of the desirability of requiring that investigative targets receive notice of third-party subpoenas to its Criminal Practice Committee.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed as of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutor used peremptory challenges to excuse two prospective jurors because one was a minister or missionary and the other was, apparently, Muslim, based on his dress and his name. The prosecutor took the Muslim garb and missionary activity as signs of religious devotion. The prosecutor explained that, in his experience, people who tended to be demonstrative about their religions tended to favor defendants to a greater extent than did persons who were not as religious. The prosecutor argued that he lacked motive to discriminate against particular religious beliefs as evidenced by his having made no effort to learn either the religious affiliations of any potential juror or the religions composition of the jury ultimately empaneled. Rather, he took exhibitions of religious devotion as an indication of lenient tendencies towards the defense, which he argued was a permissible basis for exclusion. The trial court accepted the prosecutor's explanation. On appeal, the court found that the jurors who were excluded were members of a cognizable group, and the prosecutor failed to present sufficient evidence of situation-specific bias to justify the peremptory challenges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the PCR trial court's statements that defendant would never face the death penalty, and its opinion as to its role in determining the appropriateness of the death sentence, impinged on the necessary meaningful appellate review. Accordingly, the court nullified the PCR court's findings and conclusions, based on support from Caldwell and on N.J. Const. art. I, para. 12. The court undertook a de novo review, finding that there were no credibility issues and that it had original jurisdiction under N.J. Const. art. VI, &sect; 5, para. 3 and N.J. Ct. R. 2:10-5. The court denied defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, finding that there was no basis for suppression, many issues raised did not create prejudice to defendant, and others were part of trial strategy and were deemed objectively reasonable. Counsel's performance in the penalty phase was not ineffective on issues such as mitigating factors and a reporter's contact with jurors. The State's discovery violation did not create manifest injustice. Defendant did not present a bona fide claim of mental retardation, although if he had, the trial court's procedure would have denied his due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New Jersey adopted an annual budget in the form of the New Jersey Appropriations Act of 2004, 2004 N.J.

Two related measures made available bond proceeds in excess of $ 1.9 billion to be appropriated by the legislature for any lawful purpose including the operating expenditures of state government. The appropriations clause of the New Jersey Constitution, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, para. 2, required the state to have a balanced budget each fiscal year. The issue was whether the appropriations clause allowed the state to rely upon $ 1.9 billion in borrowed monies to fund general expenses in order to balance the budget. The Appropriations Act was contrary to the purpose of the appropriations clause, which barred the state from adopting an annual budget in which expenditures exceeded revenues. Bond proceeds did not constitute state revenue and could not be used for the purpose of funding or balancing any portion of the budget pertaining to general costs without violating the appropriations clause. Because the court's holding would have greatly disrupted the operations of the government, it was given prospective effect only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial, counsel did not offer a diminished capacity defense because at that time, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:4-2 required that the defense be proven by clear and convincing evidence, and she doubted that such a standard could be met. The standard was later held unconstitutional, and even later, in the Reyes case, the state supreme court held that a claim based on preclusion from raising a diminished capacity defense could be raised retroactively in a post-conviction relief petition. Nonetheless, N.J. Ct. R. 3:22-12(a) set a five-year limitations period for filing. That deadline could be relaxed in cases of excusable neglect or for other compelling reasons, but the high court found no reason for relaxation in defendant's case. He knew he had a possible claim based on diminished capacity for years, yet he waited until more than five years after the Reyes decision to seek relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a bus operator and the bus owner, appealed from an order of the Superior Court, Appellate Division, New Jersey, which affirmed a decision of the trial court, reversing its grant of summary judgment to defendants and reinstating a personal injury and property damage action by plaintiffs, an injured driver and his injured passenger, arising from a vehicle collision. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-4.5a was held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus collided with the uninsured driver's car, and plaintiffs sued. The passenger settled her action. Defendants were granted summary judgment by the trial court pursuant to &sect; 39:6A-4.5a. However, the trial court then reversed itself and reinstated the driver's action. In doing so, the trial court held &sect; 39:6A-4.5a unconstitutional as violating the equal protection and due process guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1. The appellate division affirmed, finding that the absolute bar to recovery of noneconomic damages was arbitrary and irrational. On further appeal, the court reviewed the history of the No Fault Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 39:6A-1 to -35, and found that the limitation on suing was a reasonable attempt by the legislature to have drivers maintain insurance. The court found that there were no constitutional violations by such enactment, as the legislature had the power to create preconditions to filing lawsuits. As to substantive due process, the statute was rationally related to, and suitably furthered, a legitimate state interest. Equal protection was not violated, as disparate treatment of uninsured and insured drivers was justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the appellate division and held the statute constitutional, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court, Law Division, Middlesex County (New Jersey), which, in a bifurcated jury trial, convicted him of capital murder and then sentenced him to death under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-3(c). Defendant contended that he was denied a fair trial as a result of various rulings of the trial court in the guilt and penalty phases of the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The centerpiece of the State's case was defendant's assault on a state trooper that occurred after the charged crime and had unique similarities to the sexual assault of the victim. Reversing, the court held, inter alia, that: (1) defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial because he was deprived of the opportunity to discover which jurors would be unable to remain impartial and follow limiting instructions after hearing evidence about defendant's crime against the trooper; (2) the trial court committed reversible error in permitting an expert to testify absent the production of a reliable database; (3) there was no rational basis to support a theory of third-party guilt because the proffered evidence was not related to the murder; (4) the trial court properly struck two mitigating factors from the penalty phase; and (5) the conclusion of State v. Martini, 131 N.J. 176, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993), that a capital aggravating factor did not constitute an essential element of capital murder was no longer valid and, in all future cases, in accord with N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's counsel filed the patient's action and obtained an affidavit of merit as required by the Affidavit of Merit statute,&nbsp;N.J.

Counsel had the affidavit of merit 10 days after the answer was filed but because of a misfiling of the answer within his office, counsel did not timely serve the affidavit under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:53A-27. Defendants' motion to dismiss was filed after they received the untimely affidavit. The trial court dismissed for failure to comply with the Affidavit of Merit statute. The court fashioned an equitable remedy to save the action. The court noted past decisions in which it had allowed dismissals without prejudice where there was substantial compliance with the Affidavit of Merit statute. Inadvertence of counsel to timely file an affidavit was not a circumstance that could entitle the patient to dismissal without prejudice. The key in the patient's case was the fact that although the affidavit was provided outside the statutory time frame, it was provided before the motion to dismiss was filed. In such a case, defendants were to be precluded from filing motions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The trial court thereafter upheld the family cap against constitutional challenge, based on application of the balancing test. The appellate division affirmed, holding that the family cap provision bore a substantial relationship to legitimate and reasonable goals. On further appeal, the court noted that the rational basis test applied when economic legislation, including statutes that established benefit programs, was challenged. The court found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:10-61(a) did not infringe on a woman's right to make procreative decisions by penalizing her for choosing to bear a child. It was also held that the cap did not improperly single out classes of poor children based on their parents' reproductive choices and the timing of their birth. The court also noted that the Department of Human Services provided ample justification for the family cap.</SPAN></P>

The appellate division reversed the judgment of the trial court, which ruled that the Commission was not bound by the restrictions set forth in N.J. Const. art.

The court reinstated the trial court's judgment. The political boundary requirement of art. IV, &sect; 2, para. 3 with respect to Newark and Jersey City could not be enforced without violating the Supremacy Clause. To adhere to the one-person, one-vote doctrine, the boundaries of larger municipalities would have to be breached at times, and the Commission properly divided the two cities into more than two districts each to comply with federal law. In addition, &quot;unpacking,&quot; or distributing the voting strength of minority groups into majority districts and coalition districts, was a tool of legislative apportionment that satisfied the mandate of the Voting Rights Act (VRA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973.

After the mother died of a drug overdose, the father, who blamed the grandparents for the mother's problems, sought to greatly limit their visitation. The grandparents sued under the Statute. After noting that in the Troxel case another state's grandparent visitation statute had been invalidated on substantive due process grounds for unduly interfering with parents' rights to raise their children, the high court held that if properly interpreted, to require an initial finding based on the preponderance of the evidence that the children would be harmed if grandparental visitation were not permitted, before any consideration of the children's best interests occurred, the New Jersey statute would pass constitutional muster. In the case before it, the court held that the trial court had in fact analyzed the situation according to this approach, and found that continued visitation was the one way the children would be able to stay in touch with the memory of their mother and with her family. Therefore, the statute had been properly applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, three sets of parents on behalf of themselves and their minor children, appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which reversed the trial court and upheld the constitutionality of a random drug and alcohol testing program by defendants, a high school board of education and the Superintendent of Schools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testing program applied to all students who participated in athletic and non-athletic extracurricular activities, as well as those who possessed school parking permits. The parents contended that the testing constituted a violation of their children's right to privacy. The trial court invalidated the program, finding that it violated the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures under N.J. Const. art. I, para. 7. On appeal, the appellate division reversed that judgment and upheld the program. On further appeal, the court initially noted that it was clearly constitutional under the U.S. Constitution and accordingly, it was analyzed under the special-needs framework within the N.J. Constitution. The court found the program constitutional, noting that it was reasonable. The court stated that the students' expectations of privacy were reduced in a public-school setting; the degree of obtrusiveness was minimal because the manner in which the urine testing was done limited the intrusion on students' privacy and protected their personal dignity; and the need for conducting the testing in order to attempt to reduce the major drug problem in schools was strong.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff college appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), which reversed the trial court order that directed defendant county board of freeholders (CBF) to issue bonds in order to construct a college facility. The appellate court also held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:64A-18 was unconstitutional, and it invalidated contempt orders against various members of the CBF.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CBF changed the status of a county community college agency into a county college with the assistance and advice of the Board of Higher Education (BHE). However, based on the BHE's view that the conversion was not the creation of a new entity, compliance with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 18A:64A-2 to -6 was not had. The college's board of school estimate (BSE) certified an amount necessary for construction of a building to the CBF. In an action by the college due to the CBF's failure to fund, the CBF was ordered to appropriate the funds. On appeal by the CBF, the appellate division held that the college status was not properly statutorily achieved, and accordingly, there was no authority to compel appropriation of funds. The appellate court held N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:64A-18&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied in the instant case because the county citizens had not agreed to subject themselves to such appropriations, which was a violation of popular representation under N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6, para. 1. On further review, the court agreed with the appellate court's reasoning, but found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:64A-18 was constitutional as long as there was an opportunity for public input.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court, but modified it to the extent of holding that the statute at issue herein was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's passenger died as a result of the accident. She was indicted for second-degree vehicular homicide and was charged with various motor vehicle offenses. A jury found her guilty of the charge and the trial judge found her guilty of all the motor vehicle offenses except that of driving while intoxicated (DWI), which was reserved until sentencing. At that time, the judge found defendant guilty of DWI and sentenced her on the homicide charge as if it were a third-degree crime, imposing a three-year parole ineligibility term pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-5b(1) based on the intoxication. On appeal, the appellate division held that the intoxication finding should have been made by the jury and although the conviction stood, the parole disqualifier was vacated. On certification by the State, the court held that intoxication was not an element of the crime, and accordingly a finding on that by the judge was sufficient for sentence enhancement. Although the charges were consolidated to avoid a double jeopardy problem, that did not change the jury right on each charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOP administered a civil service promotional exam for police sergeant positions which was taken by petitioner candidates. They contended that after the exam, candidates discussed the questions and answers, typed out almost all of them, and disseminated that information throughout the police department. They claimed that candidates who took the make-up exam accordingly had an unfair advantage due to the breach of security, which violated N.J. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, para. 2. The Board rejected the constitutional challenge and on further review of the factual allegations relating to promoted candidates' knowledge due to their having taken make-up tests, the administrative law judge found no proof that they had access to the original examination. The appellate court affirmed the decision of the Board and on appeal by certification the court found no constitutional infirmity with the testing procedure itself. However, it found that the way that the make-up tests were administered was unfair and not competitive. Accordingly, those candidates who had been promoted and had taken the make-up exam were removed because their test results were held invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the finding that the testing practice was not per se unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, private citizens and the group to which they belonged, appealed from a decision of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), that affirmed a summary judgment in favor of defendants, the State and various independent state authorities, declaring that New Jersey statutes authorizing contract bond financing did not violate the Debt Limitation Clause of N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Clause placed strict limits on the extent to which the State could pledge its full faith and credit in support of general obligation bonds. Over many decades, numerous legislative schemes financed particular projects by authorizing independent state authorities to contract with New Jersey's treasurer to issue bonds with the proviso that any payment was subject to legislative appropriations. The citizens group attacked all such legislation as an effort to evade the limits of the Clause by issuing bonds that did not legally obligate the State, but that in fact did bind the State, in that it could not afford potential harm to its bond ratings. The high court surveyed case law from the many jurisdictions that had experienced similar challenges, and determined to remain aligned with the majority of states that had found contract bonds not violative of debt limitation clauses. This approach to New Jersey's Clause had been taken in the case law for too long to be disturbed--with consequent economic disruption--without action by the legislature. Therefore, if the citizens group wanted change, it would have to address the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VIII, &sect; II, para. 3 (the Debt Limitation Clause). The Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), granted summary judgment to respondents on all claims. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the constitutionality of New Jersey's use of contract debt without voter approval, arguing that the legislature would always make the necessary appropriations to prevent a default. The supreme court had repeatedly rejected challenges under the Debt Limitation Clause to contract bonds issued by independent authorities when the payment on the bonds was made subject to future legislative appropriations. Appellants urged the supreme court to reconsider its precedents that had sustained contract debt or debt subject to future appropriations. The supreme court was open to the suggestion, but required further briefing and argument. It agreed with the appellate division that the Education Facilities Construction and Financing Act (EFCFA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 18A:7G-1 to -44, was constitutional, not only because of supreme court precedent, but because the EFCFA was enacted in furtherance of the mandate of N.J. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in the penalty phase, and that the trial court erred in excluding expert testimony, refusing to consider the opinion of a capital case expert, and denying his motion to interview jurors. The appellate court ruled that a capital defendant needed to establish prejudice by showing that, but for counsel's errors, the penalty-phase deliberations would have been affected substantially. Reasonable probability was a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the result. The appellate court found that defendant failed to show that his counsel was ineffective in several areas he raised, including, inter alia, presentation of evidence of his remorse. The record showed that defendant's confession was voluntary. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding expert testimony. The trial court did err when it refused to consider the opinion of a capital case expert, but the error was harmless. Calling back jurors for interrogation was an extraordinary procedure to be invoked only on a strong showing that a litigant may have been harmed by jury misconduct, and defendant failed to show such misconduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician's practice had a pension plan that was subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1001-1461, which subjected him to certain fiduciary responsibilities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New Jersey's Mount Laurel line of cases obliged New Jersey municipalities to provide, in their land use planning, for housing for a range of income groups. Eventually, when municipalities remained still resistant, and the high court devised a builder's remedy as an incentive for builders to pursue Mount Laurel violators, the legislature enacted the New Jersey Fair Housing Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52:27D-301 to -329, which provided for mediation and other ways for a municipality to protect itself. After a resolution of its original Mount Laurel lawsuit, a township let its certification as compliant lapse, without building the units of affordable housing to which it committed. The developer sued the town again, arguing that, by not authorizing the building of modest one-family detached dwellings, the town assured that little affordable housing would be built at all and that the township's expensive sewerage requirements also made development unlikely. The high court held that it was proper to consider market demand in such circumstances, and that substantial evidence indicated that the actions in question were taken to prevent development of affordable housing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a transsexual person with a history of psychological problems, killed two police officers who were investigating her possible commission of another offense. She pled guilty, and, in two successive penalty proceedings, juries sentenced her to death in the second of her killings. The high court found most of defendant's arguments meritless, but found two errors so critical as to require the death sentence to be set aside. The first was the use, without clarification, as requested by defendant, of a jury verdict form that could have confused jurors as to the need to unanimously find any aggravating factor they planned to weigh against mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt; the jury's answer to one question suggested the belief that they could also weigh factors as to which they were not unanimous. The second error requiring reversal was the allowing of prosecutorial remarks disparaging, with no basis in the evidence, the independence of defendant's psychological expert witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court left defendant's life sentence in place, but vacated the death sentence, and remanded the matter for further consistent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), the court granted the motion of intervenor newspaper for leave to appeal from an opinion affirming interlocutory orders. At issue was the power of a court, following a hung jury in a capital murder trial that would result in defendant's imminent retrial for capital murder, to prohibit representatives of the press from attempting to conduct juror interviews after a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated the contested order to the extent that it restrained the use of juror identification information that was part of the public record of the proceedings but expanded the trial court's restraint to include juror-initiated interviews. Unlike other cases in which juror identities were anonymous during trial in order to insulate jurors from corrupting influences or to protect them from harassment and intimidation, the names of the jurors at issue were publicly identified throughout the voir dire proceeding. However, the potential for affording the prosecution an inappropriate advantage in a retrial could have been increased if media interviews of members of the hung jury revealed heretofore undisclosed details about evidentiary facts that were pivotal to the jury's deliberations. The restriction on post-verdict interviews of the hung jury imposed expired on conclusion of the retrial and return of a verdict, and properly addressed the unique concern presented that media interviews of jurors should not encroach on defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court modified and affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought direct review of a judgment of the Superior Court, Law Division, Camden County (New Jersey), convicting him of purposeful or knowing murder by his own conduct and related offenses, and sentencing him to death, after a separate proceeding before a different jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Circumstantial evidence strongly indicated that defendant and another had killed several fellow drug dealers. The high court held that the evidence was legally sufficient to support the determination of guilt, but that the trial court had impermissibly prejudiced defendant by directing the guilt-phase jury to determine whether the murder occurred through defendant's own conduct before it considered whether he was guilty as an accomplice rather than a principal. This error required reversal of the death-eligibility determination. The high court found no plain error in any of the guilt phase jury instructions, and that the evidence did not support defendant's requests for instructions on self-defense and manslaughter. It found one serious error in penalty phase voir dire, a suggestion that jurors had less than total responsibility for their death penalty decisions, and that jurors were clearly confused regarding the unanimity requirement for aggravating factors. The elements of capital murder had to be found again at the penalty phase. Finally, the court upheld the death penalty statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:3-11c, against a challenge based on evolving standards of decency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed all of defendant's convictions, but reversed the determination that the murders occurred by defendant's own conduct and the death sentence imposed thereon. If the State still wished to pursue a death sentence, a new penalty phase would have to be held, in accordance with the court's instructions. Finally, the court upheld the constitutionality of New Jersey's death penalty statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court found that defendant, a thrice-convicted sex offender, was a sexually violent predator under the Sexually Violent Predator Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30:4-27.24 to -27.38, and ordered his civil commitment, he sought review, challenging the Act's constitutionality. The Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), affirmed. Defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The experts agreed that defendant did not suffer from a paraphilia or a sexual compulsion, but his antisocial personality disorder, along with his alcohol abuse and intermittent explosive disorder, predisposed him to commit acts of sexual violence and made it likely he would reoffend. He argued that the Act's &quot;likely to engage in acts of sexual violence&quot; standard did not comply with the Crane rule, under which only those persons who had &quot;serious difficulty in controlling behavior&quot; could be committed. The state supreme court disagreed. The Act did not violate substantive due process as long as the State proved by clear and convincing evidence that the person had serious difficulty controlling his or her harmful sexual behavior such that it was highly likely that he or she would reoffend. Because this standard had not previously been enunciated, a remand to the trial court for a determination of whether defendant's mental condition justified his commitment under the Act was necessary. The supreme court rejected the contention that actuarial instruments used to assess a sex offender's risk of reoffense were unreliable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appellate division finding the Act constitutional was affirmed, but the case was remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether defendant's mental condition caused the required degree of inability to control sexually violent behavior to justify his commitment under the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former seminarian appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), affirming the trial court's dismissal, for lack of jurisdiction, of his action against defendants, archdiocese and various individuals, based in contract and tort, in which he argued that he had been driven from the seminary by acts of sexual harassment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former seminarian's college and seminary education was paid for in large part by the archdiocese in which he had hoped to serve. Discouraged by homosexual advances made to him by fellow seminarians and priests, and by hostile reactions of other supervising priests after his unsuccessful complaints became known, the seminarian withdrew, and was then billed by the archdiocese for educational expenses. He responded by suing the archdiocese and certain priests, not for federal civil rights violations, as some had done, but for breach of implied contract and tortious interference with his vocation. The high court held that despite the ministerial exception under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the trial court should not have assumed that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the seminarian's claims without examining each one to determine whether it could be heard without excessive entanglement in religious affairs. It suggested, without deciding, that the seminarian's claims for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for violation of a fiduciary relationship were among those that might survive constitutional analysis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court for detailed analysis of the former seminarian's various claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At his plea entry, defendant admitted having pointed a loaded gun at his former girlfriend in a purported effort to scare her away.

The high court distinguished previous cases on the facts, and held that the instant defendant's offense fell within the statute's reach.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For several years, beginning with the first of several decisions in the ongoing Abbott litigation, an educational advocacy group pursued its goal, on behalf of disadvantaged New Jersey parents and children, of assuring that state agencies and officials fulfilled their obligations under the state constitution, statutes, regulations, and court decisions, to assure that local school districts had the resources to offer quality preschool experiences to all interested families. The court had previously issued numerous orders and timetables, but the advocacy group argued that funding and other progress was too slow, that sufficient funds had still not been made available, and that appointment of a standing master to monitor progress was required. The court reiterated its commitment to timely compliance, but held that under the circumstances, a standing master would be a less effective means of assisting the school districts than effective pursuit of administrative and, only when appropriate, judicial remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reiterated its commitment to enforcement of timetables for decision making by officials and any necessary reviewing courts, as announced in an earlier order, but denied the motion to the extent that it requested appointment of a standing master.</SPAN></P>

It considered defendant's criminal history, his mental condition, and abuse as a child. It determined that his moral blameworthiness was moderate. Although terrible, the victim's injuries were not among the most egregious. Defendant expressed remorse, which indicated that he had the potential for rehabilitation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of possession of cocaine. The trial court had admitted into evidence, over defendant's objections, a laboratory certificate without the presence of the laboratory employee. The Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey) affirmed. Certification was granted, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police lab found that an item seized from defendant was cocaine, and issued a lab certificate saying that. The State notified defense counsel that it intended to proffer the certificate at trial in place of a witness, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-19c. Defendant filed a timely notice of objection, saying that &quot;the composition, quality and quantity of the substance submitted to the lab for analysis will be contested at trial.&quot; The intermediate appellate court affirmed, holding that absent a demonstration of specific grounds for objection showing that there was a bona fide challenge to the composition, quality or quantity of the substance, the certificate was to be admitted. The appellate court held that the language of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-19 was satisfied if an accused timely objected to the certificate and asserted that the lab results would be contested. As it was the State and not defendant that bore the burden of justification, imposition of a barrier, beyond notice, to defendant's right to confrontation was not to be countenanced. A defendant's objection, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-19, was a vehicle for notice that was quite general.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded for a hearing where the State bore the burden of proving the reliability of the methodology underlying the report. If the trial court determined that the lab employee should have been produced, the judgment affirming the conviction was to be reversed and a new trial ordered. If the trial court ruled that the report was properly admitted, the judgment was to be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cryopreserved preembryos were created in connection with an in vitro fertilization procedure which resulted in the birth of the parties' daughter. Defendant husband contended that the wife had stated her intention to either use or donate the preembryos. The state supreme court held that the parties never entered into a separate binding contract providing for the disposition of the preembryos. The state supreme court reasoned that the husband's right to procreate was not lost if he was denied the opportunity to use or donate the preembryos, and it would not force the wife to become a biological parent, with all its attendant consequences, against her will. It was represented at oral argument, however, that the wife did not object to the continued storage of the preembryos.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:11-1 to -50. The trial court transferred the case. The Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey) held the bidding requirements applied. The counties and an intervenor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The counties argued that public bidding was not required, as the contracts granted the counties easement rights on landfill space. The New Jersey Supreme Court held that for purposes of the LPCL, the contracts were service contracts and not contracts for real property or any interest therein. Although the counties retained interests in the property, the agreements were not merely contracts for the acquisition of property rights. They dealt predominantly with solid waste disposal services, both in terms of the obligations undertaken by an intervenor, a waste management company, and the compensation provided in return by the respective counties. The terminology in the contracts granting the counties a license and easement over the landfill did not alter the overriding purpose of the agreements. Therefore, the contracts were subject to public bidding under the LPCL. The supreme court held that the holding concerning the contracts should be applied retrospectively. Although the plaintiffs engaged in significant delay in bringing the action, the prospect of prejudice to the public, combined with the duration of the contracts, required re-bidding of the contracts.</SPAN></P>

R. 2:2-1(a)(1), appellant Department of Banking and Insurance challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, which held that the distance requirement contained within the New Jersey Check Cashers Regulatory Act of 1993 (Act), N.J.

The supreme court determined the record demonstrated that the legislature's enactment of the 2,500 foot distance requirement, the means chosen, was rationally related to maintaining the statutory fee cap, a legitimate state objective.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a juvenile who pled guilty to conduct that, if committed by an adult, would constitute a sexual assault. The trial court accepted the State's contention that based on defendant's Tier 2 classification, Megan's Law notification should be provided. The appellate court affirmed defendant's classification but limited the notification requirement. On appeal, defendant asserted that Megan's Law should not apply to him because he was only 10-years-old when the underlying offense occurred. Based on the conclusion that the trial court's finding on penetration was not sustainable, the supreme court reduced defendant's score, resulting in a Tier 1 classification. However, the supreme court did not disturb the notification requirement imposed by the appellate court. Finally, the supreme court rejected that contention that Megan's Law constituted cruel and unusual punishment in view of its determination to terminate registration and notification requirements at age 18 for adjudicated delinquents whose sex offenses were committed prior to age 14 and who proved by clear and convincing evidence that they were not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city filed a petition for certification requesting review of the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, affirming the order of the trial court which concluded that plaintiff, a non-conforming adult business, was protected from application of a local zoning ordinance by the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL). The supreme court granted the petition for certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1993, the city passed amendments to its code establishing minimum distance requirements with respect to adult entertainment centers. In 1995, upon denial of its license-renewal application, the business brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that the amendments violated the MLUL. The trial court determined the amendments were invalid, and the appellate court affirmed the decision. On appeal, the city argued it properly denied the business's license-renewal application because the business's operation became an illegal establishment after N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:34-7 became effective, because that statute trumped the nonconforming use protection found in the MLUL. The supreme court concluded that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:34-7 gave the city the authority to deny the business's license-renewal application. In addition, the supreme court determined that because the preexisting use provision of the MLUL, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-68, protected nonconforming uses only from subsequent municipal zoning ordinances, and not subsequent statutory changes, the prohibition in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:34-7 applied to the business's facility.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court declined to find the Act unconstitutional. It adopted a manifest injustice analysis, and held that retroactive application would harm owners.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to robbery, and other related charges. He was sentenced to 13 years, and was required to serve 85 percent before becoming eligible for parole. Defendant appealed the sentence asserting that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-7.2 of the No Early Release Act (NERA) did not apply to him. The superior court, appellate division (New Jersey), affirmed. The state's highest court granted the petition for certification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant provided a factual basis to support his guilt on each of the six counts to which he entered guilty pleas. He admitted that his role was to assist in planning a robbery of the hotel, and to provide transportation by driving the stolen vehicle to and from the scene. The court found that it was undisputed that defendant acted purposely in planning, promoting, or facilitating the robbery. The court then determined that the state legislature did not intend the word &quot;actor&quot; to apply solely to principals. It intended to impose a greater punishment upon violent criminals. NERA did not differentiate among perpetrators of violent crimes based upon principal and accomplice classifications. Thus, although an accomplice could be found guilty of a lower degree of a violent offense than a principal if the two did not share the same mental culpability, principals and accomplices were treated the same for sentencing under NERA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because NERA did apply to unarmed accomplices. For NERA purposes, principals and accomplices were treated the same. Therefore, the sentencing was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey), upholding enhanced sentences under the No Early Release Act, N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in trial court for first-degree robbery, second-degree possession of a firearm with intent to use it unlawfully against a person, and third-degree possession of a firearm without a permit. The trial court imposed an enhanced sentence under the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-7.2, due to a violent crime finding. Defendant appealed, claiming that the mandatory-minimum sentence mandated by NERA and imposed by the trial court constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The appellate court affirmed. The court granted certiorari and affirmed, holding that the trial court's imposition of an enhanced sentence under NERA required defendant's jury to find, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-7.2(e), beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant committed a violent crime. The court further held that defendant's jury found the violent crime predicate beyond a reasonable doubt in reaching its verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Convictions and sentence were affirmed were because defendant's jury found the statutory violent crime predicate beyond a reasonable doubt in reaching its verdict, and, thus, defendant's enhanced sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A resolution was filed with the secretary of state for certification and submission to the division of elections calling for a proposed amendment to be placed on the ballot. Plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the resolution violated the New Jersey Constitution. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, which the trial court granted. The dismissal was affirmed by the appellate court. On appeal, plaintiffs contended the resolution violated N.J. Const. art. IX, para. 5, because it made more than one change to the constitution but allowed for only one vote. Specifically, plaintiffs argued the separate vote requirement prohibited the dedication of two types of state revenues to a state trust fund in one amendment. The supreme court held that to meet the separate vote requirement of N.J. Const. art. IX, para. 5, any proposed amendment could not make two or more changes to the constitution unless they were closely related to one another. Accordingly, the supreme court found that under that standard, the separate vote requirement was not violated because the amendment effected two discrete changes by the dedication of two new revenue streams to the fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter came before the court pursuant to its order on certification to the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Bergen County (New Jersey), in action brought by plaintiffs seeking a declaratory judgment and preliminary injunction precluding enforcement of the Parental Notification for Abortion Act, N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment and preliminary injunction precluding enforcement of the Parental Notification for Abortion Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:17A-1.1 to -1.12. The trial court sustained the Act against plaintiffs' facial challenge. On appeal, under equal protection principles, plaintiffs challenged the Act because it conditioned a minor's right to obtain an abortion on parental notification, unless a judicial waiver was obtained, but did not impose corresponding limitations on a minor who sought medical and surgical care otherwise related to her pregnancy. The court reversed the judgment, deciding that the classification created by the legislature burdened the fundamental right of a woman to control her body and destiny, without adequate justification. The court found that the State failed to demonstrate a substantial need for the Act. Further, the court determined that plaintiffs presented compelling evidence that neither the interests of parents nor the interests of minors were advanced by the Act, and that there was no principled basis for imposing special burdens only on that class of minors seeking an abortion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, three school districts, challenged the grant of charters to newly-created charter schools within their respective districts, contending that the Charter School Program Act of 1995 (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:36A-1 to -18, was unconstitutional because it violated equal protection and due process, contravened the prohibition against donation of public funds for private purposes, and constituted an improper delegation of legislative power to a private body. The appellate court upheld the Act and appellants sought review. The state supreme court affirmed, holding that the Commissioner of Education was required to assess the racial impact that a charter school would have on the district of its residence. The court also held that the state constitutional obligation to prevent segregation in public schools must inform the Commissioner's review of a charter school application and that the Commissioner must consider the economic impact that a charter school would have on its district of residence when a district made a preliminary showing that satisfaction of the thorough-and-efficient education requirements would be jeopardized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed his victim over a drug sale, allegedly at the drug-dealer's instruction. Witnesses included a friend of the buyer and the dealer's girlfriend, both of whom were called as State witnesses at defendant's murder trial. The buyer's friend identified defendant but the dealer's girlfriend recanted her identification. After learning defendant's counsel had recently represented the girlfriend on drug-related charges, the trial court sua sponte declared a mistrial, over the parties' waivers and objections, because of the appearance of impropriety. Defendant sought dismissal based on double jeopardy, which was denied. The girlfriend did not testify at the retrial. Defendant was convicted. He renewed his motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy or because there was no manifest necessity for mistrial. The motion was denied. The appellate court affirmed. The court granted certification and affirmed, holding the interests of both parties and the public could have been disserved by defense counsel's continued representation and there was manifest necessary for the mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed, as trial court correctly found defense counsel's representation of defendant in drug-related homicide created unacceptable appearance of impropriety, justifying declaration of mistrial to vindicate public interest in fair trial, as counsel had recently represented recanting State's witness on drug charges. Defendant's retrial did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Federal litigation created the perceived need for EICs, by holding New Jersey's statutory and regulatory scheme controlling disposal of state-generated solid waste discriminated against out-of-state solid waste facilities, violating the Commerce Clause. This permitted waste generators to bypass local facilities for cheaper out-of-state disposal. Counties and authorities experienced a drastic reduction in revenue, threatening substantial default on public debt. Authorization and imposition of EICs on plaintiffs and others was a direct consequence of the unprecedented federal dismantling of New Jersey's solid waste regulatory system. Plaintiffs unsuccessfully challenged the EIC in the lower court. On certiorari from the appellate court, the court reversed, holding the EIC was not statutorily authorized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was reversed but stayed to provide opportunity for legislative action. Charge imposed by defendant authority was not statutorily authorized because statute did not contemplate imposition of unprecedented charges on non-users of defendant's facilities to liquidate debt incurred in reliance on regulatory system declared unconstitutional by federal courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, party and organizer, sought access to respondent mall to get signatures for a candidate. The Supreme Court of New Jersey reviewed what standard governed reasonableness of a mall's regulations of time, place, and manner of expressive activity, and how that standard applied. Respondent had regulations requiring non-profit organizations to provide insurance, sign a &quot;hold harmless&quot; clause, and limit access to &quot;one day, or a few days a year.&quot; Finding the business judgment rule was an improper standard, the court balanced individual free speech and assembly rights with the private property rights of mall owners. Noting that appellee accepted the risk of a general invitation to the public, and exploring the additional risk created by appellants' occasional presence, the court adopted a cost analysis to determine additional risk. Because appellee's inadequate proof failed to show real economic costs were an unfair burden, and that the insurance requirement was reasonably required for legitimate business objectives while preserving expressive rights, the court invalidated the regulations, reversed the appellate judgment, and reinstated the chancery judgment, as modified.</SPAN></P>

The defense psychiatrist believed defendant could not know the nature and quality of his acts or differentiate between right and wrong. The prosecution psychiatrist did not believe defendant suffered from a major mental disorder or disease. Defendant was convicted of murder, felony murder, burglary, robbery, auto theft, credit-card theft, and aggravated criminal sexual contact.

The trial court directed issuance of the building permits. Defendants moved for summary judgment to dismiss the remaining two counts. The trial court dismissed the interference with prospective economic advantage count, but granted plaintiffs' cross-motion for liability under the inverse condemnation claim. Defendants appealed the issue of whether the notice of claim provision in the New Jersey Tort Claims Act (TCA) applied to an action for inverse condemnation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was arrested for suspicion of hijacking as part of an investigation by defendants, but was released when his mistaken identity was learned.

However, three judges agreed with the concurring/dissenting judge that, even if probable cause was lacking, defendant investigator was entitled to qualified immunity because he could have reasonably believed in the existence of probable cause. Defendant supervisor was not liable because he did not act with recklessness or deliberate indifference in supervising defendant investigator, and his level of personal involvement in plaintiff's arrest was insufficient to find him liable under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
