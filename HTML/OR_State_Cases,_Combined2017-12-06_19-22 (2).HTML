</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed six petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the Umatilla County Circuit Court (Oregon) against defendant, the superintendent of the correctional institution in Umatilla County where the inmate was then incarcerated. After he had filed the petitions, the inmate was transferred to the Oregon State Penitentiary, which was located in Marion County. The court granted the superintendent's motion to dismiss. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by dismissing his petitions. The court of appeals agreed. The State conceded that the dismissal was erroneous. The transfer of a habeas corpus plaintiff did not automatically deprive the trial court of jurisdiction over habeas corpus proceedings. However, although dismissal was not automatically required under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34.320 (1997) because of a transfer, a change in location might have rendered the inmate's claims moot, depending on the nature of the allegations and the extent to which they were dependent on specific conditions at the particular institution. Therefore, the trial court should have considered whether transfer to another judicial district or dismissal was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant refused to obey an order to leave a county's fairgrounds where defendant was protesting the treatment of circus animals. On appeal, defendant raised constitutional and jury nullification arguments. Although defendant disavowed all facial challenges to the municipal ordinances under which she was convicted, she argued that the city violated her rights in applying the ordinances against her under the circumstances of this case. The instant court concluded that the ordinances were not constitutionally applied to defendant. The city had ordered defendant and other protesters to leave the fairgrounds before a second performance of the circus because the signs carried by demonstrators at the first performance and words spoken by them at that time created a tense atmosphere rife with the potential for violence and offended the sensibilities of patrons and their children. Even presuming that defendant herself had carried a sign or spoken with patrons - a presumption for which there was no factual foundation in the record - and that defendant's words were both provocative and offensive, the city's rationale for evicting her did not survive constitutional scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court, Lane County (Oregon), which granted summary judgment to defendants, one city, a county, and its narcotics enforcement team, on the citizens' claims for damages for false imprisonment, an alleged battery against one citizen, and violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The citizens also challenged the trial court's directed verdict grant to defendants, a second city and a detective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a search warrant was conducted on the citizens' property, they brought this action against the agencies and people involved. Upon judgments being rendered against the citizens, they appealed. The citizens contended that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the two cities and the county on the claims of battery and false imprisonment. The court reversed as to the false imprisonment claim and held that the trial court erred in determining that one city and the county were immune against this claim under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30.265(3)(a), as the claim was not covered by workers' compensation laws. Because one citizen was afforded a remedy for his battery claim under the workers' compensation laws, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment under &sect; 30.265(3)(a) on the battery claim. The court disavowed a previous case ruling that suggested that compensability of work-related injuries would always trigger the immunity provided by the statute. The court affirmed the remainder of the trial court's decision. There was no evidence of any policy on the part of the team or the second city that supported the citizens' claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's ruling in favor of the cities and the county on the battery claims, as well as the constitutional claim. The court also affirmed the rulings in favor of the detective and the team. The court reversed the grant of summary judgment to one city and the county on the citizens' false imprisonment claims. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a political party and two Oregon residents, initiated an action seeking to have Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 248.010 declared invalid and seeking a permanent injunction against enforcement of that statute by defendant Secretary of State of Oregon. The Circuit Court, Multnomah County, Oregon, granted plaintiffs summary judgment declaring &sect; 248.010&nbsp;unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds, and the secretary appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 248.010, purported to prohibit any similar words in the names of political parties. The secretary contended on appeal that the trial court erred in concluding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 248.010 was unconstitutional in that &sect; 248.010 did not implicate plaintiffs' First Amendment rights; that if it did, the statute imposed at most a minimal burden on such rights and the state's important regulatory interest justified imposition of the burden; and, finally, that even if the burden on plaintiffs' First Amendment rights under &sect; 248.010 was considered &quot;severe,&quot; the state's interest of minimizing voter confusion was compelling enough to justify the burden. The appellate court disagreed with the secretary's analysis, finding instead that (1) the case involved associational rights that did not turn on free speech issues involving whether the ballot box was a &quot;public forum,&quot; (2) that the statute placed a severe burden on the associational and voting rights of members of plaintiff party, and (3) that &sect; 248.010 was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to justify the severe burden it placed on plaintiffs' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the District Court, Coos County (Oregon), decision in the case, it reversed and remanded the trial court's order granting defendant's motion to suppress evidence. The case was remanded from the Supreme Court of Oregon for consideration and the trial court issued a per curiam decision that read, in full, &quot;reversed and remanded.&quot; Both the State and defendant petitioned for reconsideration of that decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence. Because he refused to perform field sobriety tests or submit to a breath test, the officer obtained a telephonic search warrant to take a sample of his blood. He did not consent to the test, nor was he unconscious or otherwise incapable of consent. The officer's actions therefore violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 813.140. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the blood sample because of the statutory violation. When the case was first before the instant court, it reversed the trial court's order on the ground that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.432, which was expressly retroactive, changed the relevant law. Because the officer obtained a warrant, there was no constitutional violation, and defendant did not assert any other statutory exceptions applied. The instant court rejected challenges to the retroactive application of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.432. Subsequently, the Supreme Court held the application of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.432 to any case where the crime was committed before June 12, 1997, violated ex post facto law. Therefore, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.432 could not be applied to the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed from a judgment in the Circuit Court, Multnomah County, Oregon, dismissing on the ground that a forum selection clause in a limited partnership agreement required them to bring their action in Puerto Rico, plaintiffs' claims alleging that while selling limited partnership interests in a Delaware limited partnership headquartered in Puerto Rico, defendants violated federal and state security laws and committed related torts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued their claims arose from acts that occurred prior to their entering into the limited partnership agreement, and thus did not &quot;arise from&quot; the agreement. Because the forum selection clause supported a reasonable inference that it was not intended to cover disputes arising from conduct occurring prior to plaintiffs becoming parties to the agreement, the appellate court held that the circuit court erred in finding defendants met their summary judgment burden of demonstrating that the clause unambiguously required dismissal of the claims. The appellate court also held that Or. R. Civ. P. 21(A)(1) did not authorize a motion for dismissal on the basis of a forum selection clause, as such a clause raised issues of contract law, not subject matter jurisdiction. Additionally, the appellate court held that the 1995 Or. Laws ch. 619, &sect; 1, amendments to the Oregon Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (ORICO), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 166.715-166.735, did not apply retroactively, so plaintiffs, whose cause of action accrued prior to the effective date of the amendments, could state a ORICO claim without showing a public record of conviction for the &quot;crimes&quot; alleged.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that: (1) evidence that the victim understood the mechanics of sex did not establish as a matter of law that she was capable of appraising the nature of her conduct and, thus, was not &quot;mentally defective;&quot; and (2) the trial court did not err in instructing the jury to consider the victim's understanding of the consequences of the sexual acts by considering surrounding facts and circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city determined that the corporation's proposed development, a second building on the site of the corporation's headquarters, fit the use category of &quot;general light industrial.&quot; The corporation challenged the TIF of $ 37,102 assessed against it as a taking of its property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The corporation also argued that the ordinance establishing TIF violated state statutes governing system development charges (SDC's). The city and the county asserted, among other things, that the TIF was a tax, not a fee or an assessment, and that it was not subject to the statutes governing SDCs. The instant court agreed with the corporation that the TIF qualified as an SDC and was required to comply with the statutory provisions governing such charges. However, the instant court also concluded that the corporation's statutory challenge to the TIF was untimely. It also rejected the corporation's constitutional challenges to the imposition of the TIF in this case. The heightened scrutiny required for development conditions set forth in Dolan v. City of Tigard did not apply to the TIF. Thus, the trial court properly dismissed the writ.</SPAN></P>

The signature gatherer argued that the trial court was correct in concluding the ordinance violated art. IV, &sect; 1. He also contended that the ordinance violated Or. Const. art.

The ordinance prohibited seeking signatures in specified areas without regard to any effect that engaging in that conduct produced. In prohibiting solicitation of initiative petition signatures within any transit district platform area, the ordinance prohibited speech on the basis of its content. The ordinance violated Or.

Defendant stated broadly that a forfeiture that was not reversed as a result of acquittal violated not only the due process and remedies clauses, but also the right to a jury trial, the right to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the right against double jeopardy, and the right against excessive fines. Defendant claimed that any fine/punishment was excessive where acquittals were entered. The instant court rejected defendant's due process and remedies clause arguments without discussion. It also rejected without further discussion defendant's &quot;excessive fines&quot; argument.

The instant court concluded that, regardless of whether either statute prohibited conduct or expression, neither statute violated the free expression guarantee of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Nor did Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.062 violate the First Amendment. The historical record established that the framers of the Oregon Constitution did not understand Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, to provide protection against state regulation of public sexual intercourse and masturbation. The regulation of that same conduct under Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in 1986 and the conviction became final in September 1988. The sentencing court determined that defendant was a dangerous offender and sentenced him to a 30-year indeterminate sentence with a 15-year minimum prison term. That sentence exceeded the 10-year maximum otherwise authorized for a conviction of second-degree robbery, a class B felony. Defendant argued that his sentence as a dangerous offender was unconstitutional in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi. Defendant asserted that despite the time bar of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.510(4), he was entitled to relief because he could not reasonably have raised his Apprendi claim until that case was decided. The court found that because defendant's conviction became final in 1988, he was required to file his petition for post-conviction relief by no later than November 4, 1994. The petition was filed in January 2001 and was time barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother appealed an order of the Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon, which denied her motion to set aside a default judgment terminating her parental rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother, who had been directed to appear at a June 22, 2000 show cause hearing, argued that the juvenile court erred in denying her motion because, under former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419B.515, she was not properly served with summons to appear at a September 6, 2000 &quot;best interest&quot; hearing at which her parental rights were terminated by default. The State contended that the mother lacked &quot;standing&quot; under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419B.524 to contest the termination judgment by way of a motion to set it aside. The instant court held that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419B.524 did not deprive the mother of standing to set aside the default termination judgment. It also concluded that the juvenile court's written order issued after the June 22 show cause hearing did not constitute adequate notice of the September 6 &quot;best interest&quot; hearing for the purposes of former Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419B.515. The juvenile court lacked authority to terminate the mother's rights at the September 6 hearing. It followed that the juvenile court also erred in denying the mother's subsequent motion based, in part, on that defect, to set aside the termination judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the mother's motion to set aside the default judgment was reversed. The judgment terminating the mother's parental rights was vacated. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. The trial court allowed the defendant to waive a jury trial under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 136.001, which was later declared unconstitutional. When the trial court ruled erroneously on the jury waiver issue, it had already ruled that the charges would not be severed for trial. Because the court of appeals could not determine from the record whether the trial court engaged in a prejudice analysis, the court of appeals could not review the trial court's ruling on the motion to sever. Ultimately, the court of appeals agreed with the defendant that the State's insistence on a jury trial infected the trial court's determination not only on the jury waiver issue but also on the motion to sever.</SPAN></P>

The employees argued, inter alia, that the board erred by not classifying them as police officers for purposes of PERS because they worked in a law enforcement unit. The court of appeals disagreed. The statutory framework allowed for OSH to provide care and treatment of mentally ill people who had been assigned to it by the Oregon Department of Human Services or a court. Those people went to OSH through various routes. They could have been civilly committed, transferred from a correctional facility or a youth correctional facility, placed within the jurisdiction of the Oregon Psychiatric Security Review Board after having been found guilty except for insanity, or ordered by a court for evaluation. Given that statutory framework, the primary duty of OSH, for purposes of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.610(12)(a), was the broad duty described by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 426.010, the care and treatment of mentally ill persons. Therefore, the board correctly determined that OSH was not a law enforcement unit.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's arguments encompassed three claims of error: (1) the trial court erred in failing to grant a new trial sua sponte; (2) the trial court erred in denying his request to reassemble the jury and administer the oath to it two weeks after it had returned its verdict and had been released from the trial court's control; and (3) the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial based on its refusal to grant a new trial or its refusal to reassemble the jury and administer the oath after it had dispersed. The instant court concluded that defendant failed to raise his claim below in a timely fashion. Defendant's request that the trial court reassemble the jury, administer the oath, and have the jury deliberate anew asked the trial court to do something that it lacked the power to do, and the trial court correctly declined to grant this request. By not raising an objection until after the jury had returned its verdict and had been discharged, defendant brought the equivalent of a collateral attack on the jury's authority to act in the matter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff based her claims against the city on the city's failure to inspect, maintain, and repair the curb, despite a city policy calling for inspections every two years. Her complaint against the property owner originally included claims for negligence and for what she labeled a &quot;statutory tort.&quot; The city argued that it was immune from liability under the Oregon Tort Claims Act. The property owner argued that the ordinance on which plaintiff based what she called a &quot;statutory tort&quot; claim did not apply under the facts of this case, and, if it did, it violated the city charter and was void. The instant court concluded that a decision to divert city employees from sidewalk inspection duties to flood-related duties was an exercise of discretion. This high-level decision involved the exercise of judgment by the city council, which had the authority to make and to delegate decisions regarding the allocation of city resources. Thus, the trial court did not err in granting the city's motion for summary judgment. Although the ordinance on which plaintiff based her claim against the property owner imposed liability without notice, the ordinance did not violate the city charter.</SPAN></P>

Both were arrested, and the officer then discovered defendant had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. An inventory of the vehicle was taken. The gym bag was seized, and its contents inventoried. The appellate court agreed with defendant's argument that the trial court erred by holding the officer's discovery of an outstanding warrant for his arrest could purge the taint of a prior unlawful search. The State asserted that the trial court erred in rejecting its arguments that the evidence in question inevitably would have been discovered in the course of a valid inventory. The appellate court ruled that the police's inventory policy prohibited the opening of closed containers such as the gym bag, and thus the States argument was correctly rejected.</SPAN></P>

The warrant instructed officers to search a residence located at specifically described premises. That specifically described premises, however, contained two separate residences. Nothing in the warrant provided information to permit the officers to distinguish which of the two residences was to be searched. The warrant contained no suggestion that more than one residence existed at the location, or that there was probable cause to search more than one residence at the location. Therefore, the warrant authorized the search of only one residence. Thus, the warrant was sufficiently ambiguous that it was impossible to identify with a reasonable degree of certainty the particular premises authorized to be searched.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners, organization and individuals, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Statutory law required a service district to provide a 20-year supply of buildable residential land within an urban growth boundary (UGB). If the UGB fell lower, statutory law dictated the service district was obligated to add one-half of any additional land needed to comply. The service district studied the existing UGB and found it did not meet the 20-year supply requirement. It then amended an amended UGB to include the land. In making that amendment, it considered several established land use planning goals to determine whether it properly considered the factors relevant to developing the additional land. One factor it looked at was whether public amenities could and would be economically provided. After it made the amendment to include the necessary land and the land use appellate board affirmed, the appellate court found the objection waived that the appellate board improperly considered the public amenities factor, but noted that was not the only relevant factor that was considered. It also found: (1) substantial evidence supported the appellate board's decision, (2) an administrative rule did not apply, and (3) the appellate board made sufficient findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged that defendant drove while his driving privileges were suspended by the department of motor vehicles (DMV). However, at trial, the State produced evidence that a district court had suspended his driving privileges. Defendant argued that the variance between the allegation that he was suspended by DMV and the proof that he was suspended by a court was material and that he had a right under Or. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5(3) (amended) to be tried only for the specific criminal act as to which the grand jury handed down the indictment. The trial court held that striking the language from the indictment did not materially alter the indictment. The appellate court held Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 811.175(1)(a) (1997) required the indictment assert that defendant's driving privileges had been suspended or revoked &quot;in this state.&quot; Thus, the fact that defendant's privileges were suspended in Oregon was material.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since the variance was material, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner filed his petition with the circuit court and apparently tried to tender an undertaking at that time, but for unknown reasons, it was not accepted by the cashier. Notwithstanding the absence of an undertaking, a writ was issued; the landowner later tendered an undertaking. The city moved to dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, because at the time the writ was issued, the landowner had not paid the undertaking. The circuit court concluded that, although the landowner had cured the lack of an undertaking, it was done far past the time that was allowed under the statute, and it lacked jurisdiction to consider the matter. The landowner argued that the circuit court erred when it dismissed the petition, as the undertaking was paid by the time the circuit court considered the city's motion to dismiss. The appellate court ruled that it was error to issue the writ in the first instance, and the circuit court acted without authority when it prematurely issued the writ without requiring the landowner to tender an undertaking.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was nothing particularly complex about the crime alleged in the complaint, and the defendant offered no persuasive explanation why discovery could not cure any imprecision perceived in the complaint. As a result, the court concluded the complaint was sufficiently definite and certain. The court concluded that &sect; 162.247(1) was not unconstitutionally vague in all reasonably possible applications, and therefore the defendant failed to demonstrate that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. The court of appeals disagreed. The defendant initiated and induced the victim's removal of her clothing by telling her that she was not part of the family unless she joined them in the nude. He then called her back into his presence when she attempted to leave and volunteered to teach her how to dance. He then danced with her while both were nude and pressed his genitals against her. In addition, his conduct and the statements on the following day constituted additional evidence on which a rational factfinder could rely to draw an inference as to defendant's scienter. A jury could have found that the defendant's acts of dancing with the victim and the pressing of his genitals against her body while she was unclothed and her genitals were exposed satisfied the statutory definition for &quot;sexually explicit conduct.&quot; It followed that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

State argued that the proper inquiry was not whether the statute could be read to extend to constitutionally protected conduct, but rather whether it actually did so. The appellate court ruled that defendants failed to demonstrate that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.025(1)(e) was unconstitutionally vague in all reasonably possible applications.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant negligence action arose out of an earlier wrongful death action, which resulted in an appeal. The personal representative brought an earlier action for her husband's estate, alleging medical malpractice. The circuit court signed a dismissal order and denominated it as a &quot;judgment.&quot; In entering the dismissal in the court register, however, the court clerk entered it as an &quot;order,&quot; not as a &quot;judgment.&quot; At some point later, the circuit court modified its judgment. In the instant case, the court of appeals was required to decide what authority, if any, the circuit court would have had to modify the original judgment had that judgment been final. The court of appeals held that as a matter of law, the clerk's actions could not be found to be the cause of the personal representative's damages, which was a conclusion that defeated the personal representative's claim of negligence. Thus, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment in the favor of the state and county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants, and fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer in the Klamath County Circuit Court (Oregon). Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence against her. The court denied the motion and the defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a police officer signaled the defendant to stop, the defendant, a passenger, and others got out of the vehicle and walked toward a residence. The officer told the defendant to stop, but she continued to walk away and ultimately entered the residence. The defendant argued that the trial court erred by failing to suppress evidence obtained after the officer stopped her. The court of appeals disagreed. The defendant relied on a different theory at trial than she did on appeal. The shift in the defendant's focus was not merely a technical matter of emphasis. The defendant argued that the same constitutional principles that applied to police-pedestrian encounters applied to encounters between the police and motorists. However, at trial she specifically directed the trial court away from that issue by suggesting that differences in the law applicable to the two types of encounters triggered equal protection concerns. Therefore, her constitutional argument was not preserved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was charged in the Douglas County Circuit Court (Oregon) with being a felon in possession of a firearm. At trial the defendant demurred to the indictment on the ground that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.270(1) was unconstitutional. The trial court overruled the demurrer and, after a bench trial, found him guilty. The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.270(1) violated his constitutional right to bear arms as guaranteed by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 27. The court of appeals disagreed. It was highly unlikely that the framers would have understood the constitution to guarantee an absolute right to arms possession, including felons. To the contrary, there was every indication that, consistent with the law at the time, the framers regarded felons as noncitizens, not entitled to the constitutional guarantee of political rights such as the franchise and the right to bear arms. There was nothing in the text or the history of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 27 to suggest that its framers would have understood the Oregon Constitution to provide broader protection than what had been established by the Second Amendment and the constitutions of other states, at least insofar as the regulation of a felon's possession of arms was concerned. Therefore, the trial court did not err in overruling the defendant's demurrer to the indictment.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. Under new case law, the trial court should have given significant weight to the mother's decision. That constitutional right was a supervening right that prevented the application of solely a best interests of the child analysis. Between the time the grandparents received temporary custody, and the trial, the mother regularly visited one day per week, but visited on the second day less regularly because visitation ended at noon and she had to travel 53 miles by bus to her job and arrive there by one o'clock. Further, she maintained telephone contact with child, but only infrequently. During the same period, grandparents allowed their son, a violent criminal, to visit, sometimes without their supervision. Undisputed evidence also established that the mother had an excellent parental relationship with her older son, who was thriving in her custody. Therefore the trial court erred in granting custody of the child to the grandparents.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction, arguing that the disorderly conduct ordinance under which he was convicted was unconstitutional as applied to him, under state and federal constitutional provisions protecting his rights to free speech and free religious exercise. The court of appeals did not reach defendant's arguments concerning the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or his argument concerning the religion provisions of the Oregon Constitution, as the court of appeals found that defendant's free expression arguments under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing in 1994, the claimant was declared permanently and totally disabled, and respondent State Accident Insurance Fund (SAIF) did not appeal that ruling. In 1996, SAIF requested reevaluation of the award. In October 1997, the appellate review unit affirmed the award. In January 1998, the claimant committed suicide, and his widow acquired the claimant's entitlement to his benefits. After the claimant's death, but within the 180-day appeal period, SAIF requested reconsideration of the appellate review unit's decision. After the board reversed the award, the widow argued that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 656.283(7) was unconstitutional on its face and that the Oregon Supreme Court's decision in Koskela v. Willamette Industries, Inc., compelled reversal of the board's decision. The instant court noted that the record demonstrated that the widow did not make the same argument to the court on review that she made to the board. The widow's argument asserted the right to present additional evidence. Because the positions the widow took before the board below and to the instant court were qualitatively different, the instant court declined to review the widow's assignment of error.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court, Union County (Oregon) found juvenile was within its jurisdiction on four counts of solicitation, which it merged into a single count; found him within its jurisdiction on one count of disorderly conduct; made juvenile a ward of the juvenile court and placed him on probation for a period of five years. Juvenile appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Juvenile approached some students and asked them if they wanted to help him blow up the school. The students replied with a negative response, and juvenile did not pursue the matter any further. The court ruled without discussion that juvenile solicited another to engage in a criminal act. Juvenile argued that State failed to prove that he engaged in threatening behavior, in that only his speech was threatening. State argued that juvenile's various actions of approaching students, gaining their attention, and talking to them about shooting and bombing the school, constituted threatening behavior. The court ruled that nothing in juvenile's physical acts, separate from his speech, constituted the sort of physical force or physical conduct likely to produce such force that the disorderly conduct statute prohibited. The evidence did show that juvenile grabbed a hold of a student's shoulder, however the court reasoned that while this was a physical act, it was also a common method of gaining someone's attention and did not establish the level of physical force required under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was brought more than seven years after treatment. The wife argued that &sect; 12.110(4) violated Or.

At the time the Oregon Constitution was enacted, the wife's action would have been subject to, and would have been barred by, a statute of limitations that also acted as a statute of repose because it contained no discovery rule. There was no basis to assume that the remedy provision of Or. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant went before a grand jury pursuant to a subpoena in relation to the investigation of an escort ring. Defendant refused to cooperate, and she was indicted for prostitution, pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.007. Prior to trial, defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming vindictive and selective prosecution. The Circuit Court, Multnomah County, Oregon, denied the motion. Defendant was convicted, and she appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court of appeals considered whether a prosecutor's decision not to bring charges against persons who testified truthfully against other offenders, while charging those who invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege and declined to so cooperate, amounted to vindictive or selective prosecution as to the persons who were charged. The court of appeals held that a prosecutor, in exercising pretrial charging discretion, legitimately could consider a defendant's noncooperation in investigating and prosecuting other crimes and other offenders, even when that noncooperation was in the form of assertion of a constitutional right. Such a decision, without more, did not reflect hostility or animus to the exercise of the right, nor was it an impermissible ground of selection. The circuit court therefore correctly rejected defendant's claims of vindictive and selective prosecution, and properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant challenged the judgment of the Jackson County Circuit Court (Oregon), which denied the defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained during a traffic stop, and convicted the defendant for possession of a controlled substance, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 475.992(4), and felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 166.270.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the defendant contended that suppression was required under both the state and federal constitutions, because the police officer's questioning had the effect of extending the duration of the traffic stop without reasonable suspicion. The state assigned error to the trial court's conclusion that the officer's questioning violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 810.410(3). The court affirmed the suppression order. The court held that the trial court erred in concluding that the officer's questioning of the defendant about the presence of weapons without reasonable suspicion violated Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 810.410(3), because the statute did not contain a reasonable suspicion requirement suspicion. The court also held that the even if the officer's question impermissibly extended the duration of the traffic stop, he did not improperly exploit that illegality. The defendant pointed to nothing in the record that suggested that the officer traded on the extension of the stop to get defendant to answer his question or that he did anything to force the defendant to answer his question. Suppression therefore was not required.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs argued that the trial court erred in: (1) striking from the initiative the quantity-based fees and not declaring the entire initiative invalid; (2) attempting to narrow the instant's court's earlier holding as to the preemption of local regulation of pesticides by redefining what the term &quot;pesticides&quot; means; and (3) declining to award plaintiffs prejudgment interest on the quantity-based fees that were unlawfully collected. The instant court held that the trial court did not err in striking from the initiative the quantity-based fee and, in effect, concluding that the offending article was severable from the enactment as a whole. Nothing in the initiative suggested either that the remaining portions were not capable of independent functioning or that the voters who enacted it would have preferred invalidation of the enactment in its entirety over severing the quantity-based fee limitation. However, the trial court erred in issuing what was, in effect, an advisory opinion as to the meaning of the state statute preempting local regulation of pesticides. The trial court properly declined to require the city to pay interest on the fees collected under the initiative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the judgment excepting substances from the statutory definition of &quot;pesticides&quot; was vacated, but the judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was arrested after he was involved in several drug sales to an undercover officer.

He was then taken to several addresses with which he had some connection. When officers found a room containing a large suitcase and multiple personal belongings, they searched the suitcase, finding the controlled substances that formed the basis of defendant's convictions in counts 10 through 18, along with papers belonging to the defendant. The trial court denied his pretrial motion to suppress and overruled his objection to the jury instruction stating that possession with intent to deliver also constituted delivery. On appeal, the jury instruction objection was unreserved for review. The appellate court concluded there was no evidence he waived his rights before the search occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city required dedications of the landowners' property for a street right-of-way, a sidewalk, and a &quot;clipped corner&quot; for vision clearance purposes. After its second review, the board remanded the city's decision, determining that (1) the city had justified the street right-of-way exaction; (2) the city failed to establish a relationship between the required sidewalk dedication and the expected vehicular and nonvehicular impacts of the development; and (3) as to the clipped corner, the city failed to make any individualized determination. The city challenged the board's segregation for purposes of analysis of the street dedication requirement from the sidewalk and clipped corner dedication requirements. The appellate court held that that the city did not adequately justify the proposed sidewalk and clipped corner exactions of property. The landowners argued that the board erred in concluding that the city's findings supported the determination that the street exaction was roughly proportional to the effects of the development. The court found that the city's calculations regarding the dedication requirement satisfied the rough proportionality standard.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed and reversed. The board's notice did not comply with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 183.415(2)(c) because it did not inform the psychologist that the mother's allegations, if proven true, would constitute a violation of Principle 4.02. The board's argument of substantial compliance failed, because the notice did not simply fail to cite Principle 4.02, but specifically mentioned six other ethical principles that the psychologist allegedly violated. Petitioner reasonably could have understood that the question of consent was limited to those allegations--both of which the board ultimately withdrew.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a California attorney who had agreed with respondent, an Oregon attorney, to divide the fees from a personal injury action. The court of appeals concluded that, despite appellant's difficult behavior over the telephone during the evidentiary hearing, the trial court erred in summarily precluding his participation. That action effectively defaulted appellant and, in the totality of the circumstances, exceeded the limits of the court's legal authority. Because the effects of that error pervaded the trial court's findings and conclusions, the court remanded for an entirely new hearing pertaining to the enforceability of the fee-division agreement and, if necessary, the reasonable value of appellant's services. For purposes of guidance on remand, the court concluded that, if the evidence on remand established a violation of Cal. R. Prof. Conduct 2-200(A), under choice of law principles, that violation would bar enforcement in the Oregon proceeding of the attorneys's fee-division agreement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the provisions of the statutory scheme under Or. Rev.

The court of appeals affirmed, holding that the DA's office followed the same procedure with cases involving 15, 16, and 17-year old defendants as it did with other defendants charged with Measure 11 offenses. That the prosecutors considered one of defendant's personal characteristics--age--in the course of plea negotiations did not mean that the &quot;procedures&quot; of plea negotiation were not the same for everyone. A constitutional infirmity would arise only if a prosecutor who otherwise would have extended a plea bargain to a defendant declined to do so based on the victim's wishes.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the habeas corpus trial court erred in dismissing appellant's petition because: (1) it could only speculate about why the sentencing court did not return appellant to juvenile court for disposition or waiver to adult court after concluding that Or.

Pertaining to defendant's freedom of expression claim, because it had already been held that the State could constitutionally prohibit the mere possession of visual recordings of sexually explicit conduct involving a child, it could also, via &sect; 163.684, prohibit their duplication and distribution. Defendant's vagueness challenge also failed because the phrase &quot;visual recording&quot; in &sect; 163.684, when it was read in context, was not vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) did not apply an incorrect legal standard in requiring that respondent council adequately address each locational factor. LUBA correctly concluded that respondent council's application of the priority scheme of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 197.298 did not excuse it from its obligation to address factor six and to consider the objective of that factor to retain agricultural land. The court of appeals agreed with LUBA's statement that respondent council's findings were inadequate in that they did not make a comparison to other sites. As to the cross-petition, the court of appeals found that based on the text and context of the functional plan and the portions of respondent council's ordinances, the target capacities represented respondent council's assessment of the capacity of the Urban Growth Boundary at the time of enactment of the functional plan. There was nothing in respondent council's coordinated planning documents designating how the 1997 Urban Growth Report, and presumably subsequent updates to that report, were to be used in the management of the Metro Urban Growth Boundary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to the cross-petition, the decision was reversed and remanded to redetermine target capacities. Otherwise, the decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim informed police defendant had just taken property from her at gunpoint. Police called defendant and asked him to come outside his apartment, which he did. The police arrested him and requested consent to search his apartment, which he gave. He moved to suppress this search, arguing the telephone call was an illegal seizure. Even if the call was an illegal seizure, the police did not take advantage of it to obtain defendant's consent. It was not the reason they sought his consent. Under the federal Constitution, defendant did not show the police conduct was &quot;flagrant,&quot; or did he argue his arrest in any way affected the voluntary nature of his consent. Defendant was not entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction on menacing, because the elements of menacing were not necessarily included in first or second-degree robbery, nor were its elements set forth in the accusatory instrument. The court's &quot;acquittal first&quot; instruction, requiring the jury to first acquit defendant of the crime charged before considering his guilt of a lesser-included charge, did not violate either the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed because the consent search of defendant's apartment was valid whether or not defendant's giving of consent to search was preceded by illegal police activity, he was not entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction of menacing, and the &quot;acquittal first&quot; instruction was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court ruled that respondent's assumption that Or. R. Civ.

Therefore, because petitioner followed the procedures set forth in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 163.735, 163.744, initiating a court proceeding to determine whether a stalking protective order should be issued was proper. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that respondent's statements to petitioner warranted issuing a stalking protective order where: (1) he made anonymous calls in which he stated, in unmistakable terms, what he wanted and that he was coming right over; (2) his statements were not a request for consent but instead conveyed a threat of a serious personal assault; (3) and his statements reasonably instilled in petitioner a fear of imminent and serious personal violence. However, it also found that the scope of the order was too broad because complying would effectively force respondent to choose between moving from his home and being in violation of the stalking protective order. Therefore, the order was modified.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, claiming the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal, and alleging that the restitution statute,&nbsp;Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant caused a car accident, he left the scene without providing any information to the apparently uninjured victim, who was later diagnosed with spinal injuries. Defendant was charged with violating Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 811.700(1)(a), a hit and run statute applicable where only injury to a vehicle resulted. He was convicted and was ordered to pay restitution to the victim. He appealed; the appellate court affirmed. Though defendant could have been prosecuted under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 811.705, applicable where injuries resulted from the accident, if it could have been proven that he knew of the injuries, the State was not precluded from charging him under &sect; 811.700(1)(a), which required only proof of vehicle damage.  Or. Rev.

Father argued that the state's decision in &sect; 107.108 to require divorced parents to support their children in such endeavors, while not imposing a similar burden on married parents living together, violated these constitutional provisions. The court rejected father's argument. It held that &sect; 107.108 did not violate either the state or federal constitutional guarantee of equal treatment. The court also held that divorced parents of children attending school should not be recognized as a suspect class for purposes of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the step-mother's petition for adoption, concluding that adoption was not in child's best interests. The trial court granted grandmother's petition for visitation. The appellate court affirmed the order denying step-mother's petition for adoption because step-mother was not a party to the notice of appeal. The appellate court reversed the order concerning the grandmother's petition for visitation rights. As required by Or. Rev.

The neighbors 18 pound dog entered defendant's yard, and defendant's children, crying and upset, and told defendant that the neighbor's dog was scaring them. Defendant shot the dog three times with a .22 caliber rifle. Defendant appealed contending that the trial court erred in the admission of evidence of his prior conduct toward his wife, and in its refusal to give the jury an instruction regarding the choice of evils defense. The appellate court found that the evidence of defendant's conduct toward his wife was not admissible as rebuttal of character evidence because defendant's testimony was not character evidence, it was evidence of defendant's motivation or state of mind at the time of the shooting. Further, the appellate court found that the admission of the evidence was not harmless because it could not say that there was little likelihood that the evidence of defendant's abusive treatment of his wife affected the verdict.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 810.438 to 810.439 (1997). The appellate court affirmed. The photo radar inscription was generated by a machine and not a person. Thus, it was not hearsay. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the photograph, and was within its discretion by finding that there was no likelihood of alteration or tampering of the film, and that no foundation was required. The issue of the constitutionality of the statute was not properly raised by demurrer and motion to dismiss; thus, those pleadings were not properly on review of the denial of the demurrer and motion to dismiss. Because the citation was facially sufficient, the trial court properly denied the demurrer and motion to dismiss.

The appellate court reversed and remanded for a new trial. Defendant's challenge was to the constitutionality of the exclusion order, and whether the constitution was violated by the order was a legitimate inquiry in defendant's criminal trespass trial. Defendant's failure to raise the constitutional issue by administrative appeal of the exclusion order did not preclude him raising the issue in his criminal trial. Even if defendant had brought an administrative challenge to the exclusion order, a determination by a hearing officer concerning a violation of the Portland, Or., City Code was not the type of determination that a court in a criminal proceeding would have accorded preclusive effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, operator of an adult video store, applied for a conditional use permit to allow it operate 24 hours a day.

Respondent city denied the petition, and the state land use board of appeals affirmed. On appeal, petitioner contended that its right to free expression under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 was violated. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that evidence of putative crimes in other areas was relevant, and the evidence as a whole allowed respondent city to reasonably reach the conclusion that it did. The court rejected petitioner's argument that art.

Mother dated petitioner frequently and usually included the sons. This continued for a year until mother died. Afterward, respondent allowed petitioner to see the sons several times. However, petitioner did things that respondent believed undermined him and he felt petitioner was trying to overtake a parental role. Consequently, respondent limited petitioner's contact with the sons and insisted that it occur at his house while he was present. Petitioner resented the limitations and filed an action seeking a judicial declaration of visitation rights. The trial court held that both a parent-child relationship and an ongoing personal relationship existed between petitioner and the sons, so it ordered visitation. Respondent father appealed. The appellate court reversed, stating that so long as a parent adequately cared for the children, i.e., was fit, there would normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent's children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed; the trial court should have given significant weight to the respondent father's decision that placed restrictions on petitioner's visits with respondent's sons. The liberty interest that respondent had in the care, custody, and control of his sons was a supervening right that both affected the determination of whether visitation was appropriate and prevented the application of solely a best interests of the child analysis.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed this sentence. The trial court had the authority to amend the sentence under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.222(4)(a), providing a limited exception for errors of law to Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, all of whom were state senators, appealed a judgment in favor of defendant, a Port of Portland commissioner, and intervenor governor who appointed him, in a quo warranto proceeding under Or.

The trial court held defendant could hold over from his prior term in office until a successor was confirmed and found qualified. The court affirmed. Defendant and intervenor asserted his continuation in office was authorized by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 778.215(1) and Or. Const. art.

The State's claim of error was not preserved, as trial court was not given a reasonable opportunity to make a decision based on the criminal statutes upon which the State relied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mother appealed from a dispositional review order in a juvenile dependency proceeding pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 419B.476 (1997), contending that the juvenile court erred in adopting a plan of guardianship for one of her children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of mother's children were taken into protective custody by the Oregon State Office for Services to Children and Families (SCF) and were placed in substitute care. The court took jurisdiction because mother and the children were homeless, mother's drug dependence interfered with her ability to parent the children, and mother had participated in a drug transaction in the presence of one of her children. The juvenile court changed the disposition of that child from reunification with mother to pursuing guardianship. Mother argued that the juvenile court's order permanently deprived her of custody of her child, despite the fact that the court found that she was an adequate parent who had done a great deal to turn her life around. The court's reliance on the therapist's report and testimony demonstrated, as did the court's closing reference to the &quot;significant issues&quot; faced by the child. The court held the juvenile court order only directed SCF to proceed to guardianship for the current caretakers as soon as practical. It did not establish a guardianship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed. Challenged dispositional order merely paved the way for a separate guardianship proceeding. It did not violate mother's constitutional rights as a parent because, despite that order, no permanent guardianship was established unless the permanent guardianship statute's requirements were met.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and U.S. Const. amend. I. The combinations that petitioner proposed for his custom license plates were variations of words associated with wine. Petitioner contended that the rules were unconstitutional because they imposed an impermissible content-based restriction on his speech. Respondent concluded, and petitioner did not dispute, that petitioner's proposed combinations conflicted with a regulatory provision barring approval of drug-related words, including words referring to any intoxicating liquor. The court affirmed the order denying petitioner's requested choice for custom license plates. Respondent's function in approving license plates was not a purely ministerial function, as it required an element of judgment. Because state license plates were not a public forum, the challenged rules were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Respondent paternal grandparents petitioned for visitation with the child. Appellant claimed the trial court erred in finding that visitation with respondents was in the child's best interests.

Mother claimed visitation could not have been effectuated safely and would have jeopardized the child's emotional well being. The evidence showed that visitation with respondents was not in child's current best interests. The child would not have benefitted by visitation with grandparents, despite their past relationship and benevolent intentions. Compelling evidence about the child's current condition supported appellant's assertion that contact between respondents and the child could have resulted in trauma for the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was kept in leg shackles, hidden from jury view, during his burglary and robbery trial. He argued that this violated his fair trial rights under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and the federal due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court found no abuse of discretion in the case. Looking to cases interpreting both provisions under Oregon law, which permitted use of restraints only when a trial court made a specific finding of necessity, the court found that the trial court explicitly considered evidence that defendant had a history of violence and escape attempts, that he was young and fast, that the sheriff's department could spare only one deputy for courtroom duty, and that the courthouse was not hard to escape from. Under these circumstances, the order was entirely justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment. There was no abuse of discretion where record reflected that the trial court reasonably based its decision on defendant's prior violence and history of flight, and on the fact that only one deputy was present in the courtroom.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated the sentence and remanded to the trial court. The record developed at sentencing supported either a finding that there was a single victim of both offenses or, alternatively, that each involved a different victim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant union appealed from a jury verdict, rendered in the Circuit Court, Multnomah County (Oregon), in awarding compensatory and punitive damages to plaintiff on a statutory claim under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a bookkeeping employee for defendant local union, reported to the Department of Labor her suspicions that union funds had been or were being misappropriated. At defendant national union's direction, an accountant reviewed defendant local union's books with plaintiff, and found some accounting errors but no evidence of missing funds. Plaintiff's work hours for defendant local union were then reduced, and, eventually, her employment was terminated. Plaintiff then sued, alleging numerous claims. Several of her claims were dismissed, some were settled, and some went to trial. A jury awarded plaintiff compensatory and punitive damages. Defendant national union appealed that verdict, and plaintiff cross-appealed the trial court's calculation of attorney fees. The cross-appeal was dismissed without comment. The jury's compensatory damages award was affirmed. The jury instructions correctly described Oregon's law on agency and punitive damages. Regarding a dismissed claim, the jury charge was substantially the same as that agreed upon by the parties. The jury's punitive damages award, however, was excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases against defendant school district, which had expelled plaintiff student, plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action and petitioned for a writ of review; plaintiffs appealed a judgment of the Deschutes County Circuit Court (Oregon), which dismissed their claims with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved the expulsion of plaintiff, a high school student, for writing articles included in an unauthorized publication that he distributed to fellow students on his high school campus. One article written by plaintiff included a list of acts that he would have liked to see happen at the school to the people running it. The list described, in part, feeding snake bite antidote or Visine to someone, as well as &quot;blowing things up&quot; and &quot;bomb threats.&quot; Another article included a list of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the teachers of the high school. Plaintiff argued that the underground publication was protected expression. The court ruled that the petition for a writ of review was untimely because it was filed more than 60 days after the expulsion. The court held that defendant reasonably could have believed that the publication would substantially interfere with the work of the school or impinge upon the rights of other students. The discipline in this case was not the result of an undifferentiated fear, particularly in light of the trend of increasing school violence in the country and the specific actions urged by plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that consecutive sentences of 24 months, followed by a one-year term of post-prison supervision, imposed by the Circuit Court, Columbia County (Oregon), on two counts of first-degree forgery, violated the proportionality requirement of Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree forgery. He appealed from consecutive sentences of 24 months, followed by a one-year term of supervision. The relevant presumptive sentence for a 3B conviction provided for a two-year term of probation. However, the sentencing court found four aggravating factors and sentenced defendant to 24 months of incarceration for each conviction. The maximum sentence that defendant lawfully could have received would have been a 18-month term of incarceration if defendant had been convicted of forging a $ 5,000 check and if the sentencing court had found grounds for a departure sentence. Because the sentencing court imposed a 24-month term of incarceration for a less serious level of forgery on each conviction, the sentences violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and case remanded for resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county filed an appeal, and respondent public employees filed a cross-appeal, from the trial court's grant of summary judgment for respondents on their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and breach of contract claims, and for appellant on respondents' wage claim. Regarding respondents' breach of contract claim, the evidence would permit a jury to find that appellant intended the pay increase to be only an offset for the loss suffered by respondents because of the ballot measure. However, there was also evidence to support respondents' position that the purpose of the pay increase was to make appellant's salaries competitive with other employers' salaries. Regarding respondents' &sect; 1983 claim, the ballot measure was an act of the state, not appellant. Thus, if there was a &sect; 1983 claim arising from the ballot measure for impairment of respondents' contracts, the state, not appellant, was the proper party to sue. Consequently, the grants of summary judgment for both respondents and appellant on respondents' breach of contract, &sect; 1983, and wage claims were reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for murder, in violation of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 163.115(1)(b). Defendant only challenged the sentence imposed, imprisonment for life with a minimum sentence of 300 months, pursuant to ORS 163.115(5). While defendant's case was ongoing, the supreme court held that the imprisonment for life sentence under Or. Rev. Stat. 163.115(5) was unconstitutionally disproportionate. The state legislature responded by granting the state's parole board express authority to parole a person who has been convicted of murder under ORS 163.115, regardless of the date the crime was committed. On appeal, the defendant argued that the application of the new legislation violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws. The court affirmed the defendant's conviction and sentence. The statute in force at the time defendant committed the crime mandated an imprisonment for life sentence on a conviction of murder. The new statute gave defendant the possibility of parole upon completion of the minimum term. The new statute was ameliorative, so its application to defendant presented no ex post facto violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court was affirmed because the retroactive application of the statute, which allowed the possibility of parole upon completion of the minimum term of sentence for murder, did not present an ex post facto problem because the statute was ameliorative and did not increase the quantum of punishment from that statute in effect when the defendant had committed the crime.</SPAN></P>

Appellant opposed, arguing the court lacked authority to amend his sentence once it had been executed. The trial court concluded that omission of the post-prison supervision was an error of law requiring correction. Although appellant conceded that the sentence originally imposed was legally incorrect, appellant argued that the trial court erred in concluding that it had authority to correct the judgment. The court affirmed, holding that sentences that violated the statutes lack valid sentencing authority, and the trial court could modify them as necessary. Therefore, the trial court retained authority to modify appellant's sentence to impose the missing, but required, term of post-prison supervision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery, which was subject to a 90-month minimum sentence under Ballot Measure 11, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.700(2)(a)(Q) (1994). The sentencing court declared that statute unconstitutional and imposed a sentence of 55 months under the sentencing guidelines. Both parties appealed, but after the state supreme court ruled the statute constitutional, the state dismissed its appeal. The parties also had jointly moved for remand for reconsideration of the denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence. The appellate court granted that motion, and in doing so, vacated the judgment. On remand, the trial court denied the suppression motions, and imposed the 90-month sentence. On defendant's appeal, the court affirmed. By vacating the original judgment, the 55-month sentence was rendered void, and the trial court was then vested with jurisdiction to resentence defendant. Because the statute imposed a minimum 90-month sentence, the 55-month sentence was erroneous as a matter of law. Therefore, the trial court was within its authority to correct the error on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Oregon Supreme Court vacated the instant court's prior decision that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.065(1)(a) violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and remanded for reconsideration of appellant's convictions of furnishing obscene materials to minors under &sect; 167.065(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initial decision concluding that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.065(1)(a) did not focus on preventing harmful effects that could be constitutionally proscribed and reversing appellant's convictions of furnishing obscene materials to minors under &sect; 167.065(1)(a) was vacated and remanded. On remand, the court concluded that it erred in its former conclusion, but held, nevertheless, that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and again reversed the convictions under that statute. Although inartfully expressed, the legislature's purpose in enacting &sect; 167.065(1)(a), to protect children from the effects of hardcore pornography, was permissible. However, the statute was still unconstitutional under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because the defense to &sect; 167.065(1)(a) provided by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 167.085(3) did not adequately exempt from criminal responsibility those persons whose intent was not to titillate minors. Therefore, it was overbroad and impermissibly restricted the right to speak, write, or print freely on any subject whatever under Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Concluding that it erred in its former conclusion, the court, nevertheless, adhered to its ultimate holding and reversed appellant's obscenity convictions because the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad because it did not adequately exempt from criminal responsibility those persons whose intent was not to titillate minors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, various business owners, appealed from the Circuit Court, Benton County (Oregon), which sustained the validity of defendant city's ordinance which prohibited smoking in enclosed public spaces.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, various business owners, challenged the validity of defendant city's ordinance which prohibited smoking in enclosed public spaces. The court found no conflict between the ordinance and state law. The Oregon Indoor Clean Air Act, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 433.835 et seq., did not contain the slightest hint that the legislature intended to create a positive right to smoke in all public places where it did not expressly forbid smoking. There was no issue of preemption. Plaintiffs focused their vagueness attack on Corvalis, Or., Ordinance &sect; 160.04, which prohibited smoking within a reasonable distance, but not less than 10 feet, of an entrance to a smoke-free area. Plaintiffs' objection was not that the ordinance was vague, but that it was unfair, a matter for the city council to decide. Plaintiffs failed to show that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague in all of its possible applications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Nothing in the Oregon Indoor Clean Air Act was inconsistent with defendant city's decision to impose greater limits on public smoking. Preemption was not an issue. Plaintiffs could not show that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague in all possible applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under Portland, Or., City Code &sect; 14.32.100 for carrying a concealed, dangerous, or deadly weapon commonly known as a &quot;nunchaku,&quot; and defendant alleged that the prosecution failed to present evidence that the item carried by defendant was &quot;commonly known&quot; as &quot;nunchaku&quot; and that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the &quot;commonly known&quot; language of the ordinance did not define an element of the offense but merely described the item which was unlawful to conceal and possess. In any event, the evidence showed that defendant possessed and concealed a weapon designed to inflict serious physical injury, thus satisfying the general definition of a dangerous or deadly weapon. Further, defendant had fair warning of the conduct which was prohibited by the ordinance, regardless of commonly accepted term for the dangerous or deadly weapon, and; thus the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city's charter was amended in 1996 to include a section (City of Gresham, City Charter, &sect; 36B (&sect; 36B)) which prohibited construction of highway roads through the city without prior voter approval. Appellant passed a resolution supporting the development of such a road without getting the voters' prior approval. Appellee challenged appellant's actions. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the lower court found appellant violated its city charter and awarded attorney's fees to appellee. Appellant challenged that decision. The court found &sect; 36 constituted &quot;municipal legislation&quot; within the meaning of the Oregon Constitution, art IV, &sect; 1(5), and not an administrative decision. Consequently, it was constitutionally passed. Moreover, because appellant's resolution violated its city charter, it was properly struck down. The court reversed the award of attorney's fees, however, finding that the violation of &sect; 36B was not the sort of important constitutional right that gave rise to attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed on the merits, but reversed the award of attorney's fees, finding section of city charter which prevented building of road was a municipal legislation, properly passed, that prevented appellant's action. Attorney's fees were inappropriate because appellee did not protect an important constitutional right justifying fee shifting.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered an order forfeiting the animals and respondent was eventually acquitted on all charges. Defendant appealed from the order forfeiting the animals. The state argued the order was non-appealable. The court agreed, holding that as there can be no sentence, probation or other sanction after an acquittal, no event provided for in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.053(1) occurred, and the order was therefore not appealable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.040, nor appealable under Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of rape following pleading guilty to crimes committed against his girlfriend's 13-year-old daughter. The trial court sentenced defendant to 16-months' imprisonment rather than the mandatory minimum 75-month sentence under Or. Rev.

On appeal, the court reversed, having found that the 75-month sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because it was not so disproportionate to defendant's offense so as to shock the senses. Nothing about the victim's supposed sophistication or defendant's naivete supported the conclusion that imposition of the mandatory sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The fact that defendant made statements to police and cooperated by accepting a plea bargain did not render the mandatory sentence unconstitutional, nor did the fact that defendant would be returned to Mexico after his release from prison.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, holding that the statutory context did not indicate that a nonviable fetus was a person for purposes of the wrongful death statutes; and therefore &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of Or.

First Interstate Bank and held that under subsequent United States Supreme Court decisions, Congress did not have the power under U.S. Const. art. I to alter the jurisdiction of the state's courts.

Appellant moved to suppress the statements he made to the police officers and to the detectives. The trial court granted appellant's motion regarding his statements to the police, but denied the motion regarding his statements to the detectives.

III, &sect; 1 (2003), and thus a taxpayer had to apportion income under Or. Rev.

IV, &sect; 22 against revisions or amendments without full-text publication; [3]-There was no contract and thus no violation of the Oregon Contract Clause, Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 21, or the Federal Contract Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, because the Multistate Tax Compact allowed unilateral withdrawal by any state and was an illusory promise lacking statutory contract language; [4]-The Compact Clause, U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was the common parent of a group of corporations. The taxpayer's commercial domicile was not in Oregon. During the relevant years, the companies were engaged in the telecommunications business in both wireline and wireless operations. As a consequence of the stock sale and related transactions, the taxpayer was, for practical purposes, no longer engaged in wireless operations. The taxpayer treated the gain as nonbusiness income, none of which was allocated to Oregon. The assets considered to have been sold were all assets that had been employed in a unitary business operating, in part, in Oregon. The court concluded that the gain was apportionable business income under &sect; 314.280 and the rules promulgated by the Department pursuant to that statute. Alternatively, the gain was business income under the Department's rules when measured against the statutory language of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.610. By conceding that it operated a unitary business, the taxpayer also conceded that the assets located outside Oregon bore a constitutionally required relationship to the assets and business operations of the taxpayer's consolidated group located in Oregon.</SPAN></P>

A registered appraiser concluded that the property's RMV on the tax roll value was less than an indicated value using a market approach or cost approach. Plaintiff challenged defendant's use of its annual ratio study to establish a trend factor of an eight percent increase. Plaintiff alleged that defendant's determination of RMV for tax years 2007-08 and 2008-09 was outside the statutory authority of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 309.115(2). The Oregon Tax Court concluded that defendant's use of a ratio study to trend the adjudicated value of the subject property was acceptable. Defendant's practice of rounding up a trend factor did not violate Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the school district challenged the assessment and taxation of its publicly owned property, contending that Oregon law clearly established that it was only the lessor's leasehold interest that was potentially taxable under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.110(1). The appellate court agreed and concluded that the school district's interest in its publicly owned property was exempt from taxation. While real property owned by the state and other governmental entities was generally exempt from ad valorem taxation pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.040 through Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.090, public property leased to a taxable private owner was subject to tax. However, absent a clear statutory mandate, the appellate court would not uphold the assessment of property taxes against the school district, with the result that nonpayment could result in the foreclosure and sale of the property to the county. The appellate court did not believe that the legislature generally intended the county to acquire state and other governmentally owned property for nonpayment of taxes.</SPAN></P>

The claim for refund was premised on the position that the Oregon statutes regarding the taxation of the interest was unconstitutional Upon review, the court noted that while it had jurisdiction to consider cases under the Declaratory Judgments Act, it should refuse to do so when adequate remedies, including administrative remedies, existed. In addition, there was an independent case law exhaustion requirement with respect to declaratory relief. The taxpayers had a complete remedy available to them, if they were correct legally, in the form of proceedings under &sect; 305.270 for a refund. Proceedings under &sect; 305.270 and Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.275 (2005) afforded the taxpayers the possibility of a refund of any tax paid under an invalid statute as well as such interest as was provided by law.

The taxpayer argued that a return was filed, and under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 308.296(2) (2005), the penalty should be only five percent of the tax. He also argued that the oath requirement violated his federal constitutional right to freely exercise his religion, and his state constitutional rights to freedom of worship and freedom of religious opinion under Or.

Rev. Stat. 314.280 and the rules and regulations associated therewith. The case was remanded to the tax court from the Oregon Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed its Oregon corporate excise tax returns for the years 1988 through 1992 by applying the standard three-factor apportionment formula that the Department had prescribed for use at that time in Or. Admin. R. 150-314.280-(E) (1987). It did not include intangible personal property in its apportionment calculations. The Department applied Or. Admin. R. 150-314.280-(M) (1995) (Revised M) and issued notices of deficiency. This decision was appealed, and ultimately, the case was remanded to the tax court for further proceedings. In partially entering judgment for the taxpayer, the tax court held that Revised M, when reviewed for its substantive compliance with Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.280 (1987), was not a justification for the Department's decision. The returns of the taxpayer were prepared in accordance with a valid regulation and had to be accepted. The taxpayer's apportionment fairly and accurately reflected the net income of its Oregon business; therefore, even if Revised M permitted the actions of the Department, the adjustments were void. Finally, given the taxpayer's irrevocable concession of a counterclaim, the Department was entitled to a partial judgment.</SPAN></P>

Subtracted from this award was the amount of the Department's counterclaim, plus statutory interest.</SPAN></P>

Prior to September 1996, while the taxpayer was a resident of California, loans were taken out against the policy. The taxpayer became an Oregon resident in 1996. The life insurance policy lapsed in July 2002, because the loans taken against it had reduced the cash value to a balance insufficient to pay the premiums. The taxpayer alleged that her ex-husband obtained the loans against the policy without her permission or knowledge by way of forgery. The insurance company issued a 1099-R under the taxpayer's social security number for tax year 2002 for a gross distribution of $ 87,330, $ 37,487 of which the Internal Revenue Service determined to be taxable income. The court ruled that the Department properly imposed tax on the proceeds of the policy in 2002. The loans against the policy were not taxable distributions when received, but instead, the loans became income subject to tax when the policy lapsed in 2002 for nonpayment of premiums.

Instead, the taxpayer subsequently filed a petition with the Department, asking it to exercise its supervisory power to correct errors in the rolls, as granted by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 306.115.1. The Department determined that it lacked the authority to review the merits of the taxpayer's petition. The taxpayer sought review from the Magistrate Division, which affirmed. On appeal, the court ruled that an abuse of discretion standard applied for discretionary decisions such as the one involved in this case, under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.425. The court ruled that the more specific intent, here, the abuse of discretion standard contained in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 306.115, clearly controlled the more general intent of &sect; 305.425 and its de novo standard. The court held that it must review decisions of the Department under &sect; 306.115 for abuse of discretion. Therefore, the proper standard of review for Department decisions under &sect; 306.115 was for abuse of discretion, and Or. Admin. R. 150-306.115(3)(b)(A)(ii) was valid.</SPAN></P>

The Department claimed that the taxpayer failed to file income tax returns for the years 1999, 2002, and 2003. The taxpayer claimed that she mailed her tax returns for the years at issue, but had no responsibility to ensure receipt. The court explained that the taxpayer failed to provide any evidence of mailing, as required by Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.820(1)(c)(A) (1999). Even if her returns were lost in the mail, she failed to comply with &sect; 305.820(1)(c)(B) by filing duplicate returns within 30 days after written notification. The taxpayer failed to persuade the court that there was any legal basis to excuse her failure to comply with the laws. She failed to provide any law to support her position that, because she concluded that the tax laws were complex, she was not required to file returns.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation operated as a cellular phone business. An auditor determined that a deficiency existed, and the taxpayers sought review. In affirming, the appellate court first determined that the corporation was engaged in a trade or business. The corporation did substantially more than engage in &quot;purely legal steps&quot; to preserve its ownership rights in its Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license. Next, the net taxable income reported by the corporation for the years in question, including the sale of assets and the FCC license, was &quot;income arising from transactions in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business&quot; under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.610(1) (1999). The acquisition, management, use and disposition of the FCC license was integral to the corporation's regular business operations. Also, the net taxable income was subject to appointment under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.280 (1999) because the corporation met the definition of a public utility. Finally, a zero payroll factor, when combined with the uncontested property factor and the sales factor determined by the appellate court, resulted in a &quot;fair and accurate reflection&quot; of the corporation's net Oregon income.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court previously held that the Department violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in apportioning $ 12,787,485 of taxpayer's 2003 income to Oregon. Also, despite the parties' arguments to the contrary, it lacked the authority under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 314.670, 314.280, or 317.660 to reapportion taxpayer's income using any method other than that set out in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;317.660. Because the instant court concluded that it lacked the inherent power to reapportion taxpayer's income, it ordered the Department to refund to taxpayer the full amount of income tax it had paid for the 2003 tax year. The appellate court granted the Department's motion for reconsideration but reiterated that the taxpayer had to be refunded the amount of taxes that it was assessed under the unconstitutional apportionment because it was impossible to determine the amount of tax that taxpayer should have paid Oregon under a constitutional apportionment. As the method used in &sect;&nbsp;317.660 was unconstitutional and the court had no authority to reapportion the taxpayer's income, the only option left was a full refund except for the $10 minimum tax under Or.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance company taxpayer and defendant, the State and the department of revenue filed cross-motions for summary judgment in the taxpayer's action alleging that the department's three-factor apportionment of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 317.660 (2003) in determining the taxpayer's insurance excise tax violated the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer did business in all states, and had no physical operations or employees in Oregon. Its Oregon insurance policies originated through direct mail or telephone solicitation. The taxpayer argued that in receiving $252,379 in income from two loans secured by Oregon property, its taxable income was increase by over 1,000% under the apportionment formula of Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 317.660 (2003). The department stipulated that the Oregon property was not necessary to the taxpayer's insurance business. The court granted summary judgment to the taxpayer, and held that although the value generated by the taxpayer's income from Oregon property was not negligible, it could not have represented one-third of taxpayer's total value in light of the stipulation. Yet the department, in applying &sect; 317.660, assumed the latter and therefore drastically increased the amount of taxpayer's income apportionable to Oregon. Application of &sect; 317.660 allocated to Oregon a share of income that was out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted in Oregon. The high real estate income and interest factor grossly distorted the value generated by the taxpayer's Oregon operations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owners maintained that 93 percent of the proceeds of a voter approved levy of respondent city had to be accounted for in the &quot;public school funding&quot; category of Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11(b) (Measure 5), which was added to the Constitution by initiative. The city argued that all proceeds of the levy were properly accounted for in the &quot;other government&quot; category of Measure 5. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties agreed that Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 310.155 applied to the case, and the owners conceded that they could not prevail if that statute was constitutional. The difference in categorization, as set out in &sect; 310.155, was important because a substantial number of properties subject to the levy, including the owners' properties, would have the benefit of Measure 5 tax limits if the levy or its proceeds were categorized as funding public schools, but not if the levy or its proceeds were categorized as funding other government services. The court noted that categorization at the levy level was not permitted and that to the extent that &sect; 310.155(2) and (3) were inconsistent with that rule, meaning to the extent that they limited categorization of the proceeds of mixed use levies to only one category, they were unconstitutional. The court went on to determine that the funds provided to the school districts by the city were for educational services within the meaning of &sect; 310.155(4). The programs were to be &quot;school-based,&quot; and nothing in the record indicated that the services funded by the 93 percent increment would be made available to the public generally.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed the assessment of personal income taxes by defendant, the Oregon Department of Revenue. The issue on appeal was whether the taxpayer's income for the 2003 tax year was protected from Oregon's personal income tax by the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer received railroad retirement benefits from the time he worked for a special district of California Bay Area Rapid Transit. The taxpayer contended that his retirement benefits qualified for the railroad retirement subtraction authorized by the Act. The court noted that not all benefits paid by organizations with the attributes of railroads qualified for special treatment. Only Railroad Retirement Board benefits, as set out in 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 231, were protected from state income tax. California public retirement payments are not made through the Railroad Retirement Board. Because taxability was determined, not by the duties an employee performs to gain his or her retirement, but by who paid the retirement, the taxpayer's income was not protected from Oregon income tax. The court also rejected the taxpayer's argument that there was a violation of the Equal Privileges and Immunities granted by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, in that taxing on the basis of the entity paying the retirement benefit was neither impermissibly based on a person's immutable characteristics nor was it invidious or lacking in rational foundation.</SPAN></P>

It therefore concluded that the taxpayer's claims for relief as to the 2004-05 had to be dismissed. The court next addressed the claims for declaratory relief. To the extent those claims related to the county's treatment of her property for the 2004-05 property tax year, those claims also had to first be brought in the magistrate division. To the extent that the taxpayer requested some form of forward looking declaratory relief, the court could not order such relief. Finally, the court dismissed the taxpayer's claims for injunctive relief as well. The court concluded that the taxpayer had to first seek relief in her magistrate division case, which was already pending.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Oregon Department of Revenue, imposed corporate excise taxes on plaintiff taxpayer under the statutory apportionment formula for the years 1997, 1998, and 1999. The taxpayer appealed the tax assessments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer conducted business in four states. The taxpayer argued that its Oregon tree farm was a trade or business that was separate from its operations in other states. Whether the taxpayer qualified as a single trade or business depended upon whether its interaction with the tree farm satisfied the three factors identified in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 317.705(3)(a) (1997). The court held that the taxpayer was subject to apportionment because all three factors were established. Centralized management and a common executive force was demonstrated by the taxpayer's board of directors and the supervisory role performed by one of its executives. The economies of scale were apparent in the taxpayer's appointment of the executive as a liaison for the tree farm, centralization of services such as tax preparation, and routine meetings between its board of directors and the tree farm manager. The third factor was met because functional integration was apparent. As the taxpayer did not demonstrate that the formula was unconstitutional as applied, application of an alternative method was not mandatory for 1997 and 1998. However, for tax year 1999, the property factor was to include intangibles.</SPAN></P>

The court found that application of an alternative method was not mandatory for tax years 1997 and 1998. However, for tax year 1999, the court found that the formula as a whole required adjustment to operate fairly. Further, regarding all three tax years, the court held that the Department had to include gross receipts in the sales factor.</SPAN></P>

Believing that the land was subject to WOSTOT, the taxpayer did not pay taxes on the harvested timber. The issues before the tax court were, inter alia, whether the first year's complaint was time barred; whether the timber harvested the second year was subject to WOSTOT; whether the tax court could waive penalties pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.145 (1997); and whether the tax court should strike the Department's affidavit and exhibits. As to the first issue, the taxpayer did not file a timely appeal. An extended time for appeal was not available. The complaint for the first tax year was time barred. For the second tax year, the harvested timber was not tax exempt, as the taxpayer did not apply for WOSTOT certification. The tax court could not waive the assessed penalties.

The city did not give notice of the adoption of the surcharges under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.583(8). The taxpayers alleged that the surcharges were invalid under Or. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 11, 11b. The taxpayers further alleged that the surcharges violated Or. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 20, 32, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The parties focused their arguments on whether the surcharge was imposed upon property or imposed upon an owner of property. The appellate court concluded that the features of the surcharge were such that it was a tax. The surcharge was subject to constitutional limits; however, the amended surcharge was neither a tax imposed upon property nor a tax imposed upon an owner of property by reason of that ownership. The surcharges did not violate Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 32, and the use of a flat rate per unit rather than an ad valorem rate was not unconstitutional. As to the equal protection challenge, the surcharge withstood the rational basis test, as the classifications employed were not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

In order to clarify the issues in the case, the Department sought a preliminary ruling regarding the application of Or. Admin. R. 150-308.205-(D) (2001). Although the taxpayer objected, the court found that the his consent was not necessary. The property was used as a vegetable processing plant. The court held that Rule 150-308.205(D) did not prohibit the highest and best use (HBU) of the property to be other than its current operation where the machinery and equipment were liquidated, and the building had an alternative use. The court rejected the taxpayer's assertion that the HBU analysis was limited to the current use of the property or alternative uses that involved minimal alteration. The court noted that the fair market value principal included a consideration of HBU, which required that the valuation of the plant be compared with its value under alternative uses. Further, the consideration of alternative uses allowed for the disposal of some components of the property. Finally, the court held that case law did not require a tight restriction on the HBU analysis.</SPAN></P>

The error was in the assignment of an assessed value. The issue was whether the assessor was able, despite its mistake, to collect taxes that otherwise ought to been imposed on the taxpayers. The court noted that the assessor's error was not in the assignment of real market value to the property. The mistake was limited to the assignment of assessed values under Ore. Rev. Stat. &sect; 308(2)(a)(b) (2003). The error occurred when the results of the appraisal were processed not at its real market value, but at a lower assessed value. The taxpayers reasoned that they paid the taxes demanded of them at the time and then faced genuine hardship in order to rectify the mistake made by the assessor. The court held that the most relief available was to permit the payment of additional tax without interest under Ore. Rev. Stat. 311.203(2) (2000). Therefore the appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.110 (2001). Read together, Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 307.030(2) (2001), Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 308.510 (2001), and Or. Rev.

The central assessment statutes did not require the intangible personal property to be connected to tangible personal property or real estate in order to be taxable.

The taxpayers claimed that either their property was exempt because their title ultimately traced to the federal government or that the State of Oregon had no power to levy a direct tax on property. The court granted the Department's motion to dismiss, stating that the immunity claim by the taxpayers was without merit. Although the federal government was immune from direct taxation by the states, those who took title from the federal government shared no such immunity. The court stated that the plenary power of the State of Oregon to impose taxes, subject only to constitutional limitations, had long been recognized. The court also found that the taxpayers' position was frivolous, because the taxpayers had provided the court with writings that contained spurious quotations and cases that did not support the assertions made by the taxpayers.

They also asserted that their property should be exempt due to religious and humanitarian aid and the presence of a family burial plot. The chain of title to the property also included a United States Patent. The owners concluded that their title to the property was superior to that held by the State and that land could not be taxed if its patent was current. The court was willing to accept the owners' point that they owned their land, that their title was superior to any other, and that their ownership could be traced back to an U.S. Patent. These points established, however, not that the owners were exempt from tax, but that they bore a tax burden. The court concluded that the owners' arguments, although demonstrating considerable legal research, were simply misplaced in their conclusions. The county had the ability to tax the owners' property, despite the fact that its chain of title included an U.S. Patent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer lived in Oregon. The department notified the taxpayer that, based on its determination, the taxpayer incorrectly claimed withholding allowances. The department instructed the taxpayer's employer to withhold state income tax based on a single status with two allowances. The taxpayer claimed that he was exempt from Oregon personal income tax because: 1) wages were not income; 2) only foreign source income was taxable; 3) the only employees subject to state income tax were employees of the federal government; 4) state income taxes constituted a &quot;taking&quot; of property without due process of law; and 5) federal income tax laws were unconstitutional. The magistrate held that all of the taxpayer's arguments had been rejected by the courts and that the taxpayer had not presented any new or persuasive evidence in support of his arguments. The magistrate awarded the department damages under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305 (2001) because the taxpayer's appeal was frivolous. The magistrate noted the definition of frivolous in Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.437(2) (2001) as a claim where there was no objectively reasonable basis for asserting the position.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer did not challenge the amount of the tax deficiencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed his 1990 and 1992 tax returns in 1995, and filed his 1995 tax return in 1997. The taxpayer received a refund for the 1992 tax year, which he returned with instructions to apply it to taxes for subsequent years. The Department applied it to his 1996 tax year. Deficiencies were later assessed for the 1990, 1992, and 1995 tax years. In 2001, the Department applied refunds from the taxpayer's 1997 and 1998 tax years to his 1995 deficiency account. The taxpayer argued that the Department should have first applied the refunds to the 1990 and 1992 tax year deficiencies to reduce the interest due on those deficiencies. The court found that the Department had properly followed the taxpayer's instructions for the 1992 refund and that it had correctly applied the 1997 and 1998 refunds to the &quot;newest account&quot; pursuant to Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.415(1)(e) (2001) and Or. Admin. R. 150-314.415 (1)(e). The court also noted that the taxpayer failed to show that he suffered harm because Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 305.265(13) required that payments first be applied to the penalty, which would have taken all of the 1997 and 1998 refund, leaving nothing to reduce the interest or tax due.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment and granted the Department's cross-motion for summary judgment, holding that the Department had properly applied the payments to the taxpayer's deficiencies.

Roughly four years later, the taxpayers filed an amended Oregon return claiming deferral of the recognition of the gain in 1996 and sought a refund of the tax previously paid. The department denied the refund request under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.415(1) because the amended return was not filed within three years of the date of the original return. The court found against the taxpayers, stating that they did not qualify under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.738 (2001) because the tax year involved was before January 1, 1998.

It sent the taxpayers a notice of its intention to correct the error. The Assessor also denied the taxpayers' request for a payment plan. The taxpayers filed an appeal, which requested a reversal of the error. In denying the taxpayers' appeal, the court determined that the Assessor was permitted to correct the clerical error under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 311.205 (1999). The correction was valid, as the taxable assessed value of the property should have increased every year by three percent, pursuant to Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11(1)(b). As the correction was proper, the additional taxes arising from the error were added to the tax bill for the tax year following the correction. Therefore, the court was not permitted to authorize a payment plan. However, the court noted that the taxpayers had the option of paying in installments under Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sued defendant Department of Revenue (Oregon), challenging an employer payroll tax assessed on the amount of the wages paid to its employees after the city where the taxpayer's business was located was annexed into a mass-transit district by a special election. The revenue department oversaw the collection of the tax levied by the transit district. The revenue department filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because voting on the annexation measure was limited to the residents of the city and taxpayer's shareholders did not live in the city, the taxpayer contended that it was subjected to taxation without representation. The taxpayer argued that the tax resulted in double taxation, as mass-transit systems were federally subsidized and taxpayer's shareholders paid federal income taxes. Finally, the taxpayer claimed that, because the tax was paid only by businesses, not residents, the tax was not uniform, as required by Or. Const. art. I, &sect; 32. The tax court found that the appropriate remedy for the taxpayer's asserted unfairness was with the legislature and not with the courts. The tax court stated that the taxpayer did not provide any authority that supported a finding that the tax or Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 267.385, the statute authorizing the tax, were unconstitutional because of the political processes relating to the inclusion of the city within the transit district. The tax court found that taxing businesses as a group was not based on impermissible criteria and using a payroll tax on employers to fund transit district operations had been upheld against the challenge of uniformity.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer asserted that defendants acted without a reasonable basis because the gross-receipts tax on its face violated the United States Constitution. The reviewing court found that the taxpayer complied with Or. R. Civ. P. 68C(2)(a), which required a party to allege the facts, statute, or rule that provided the basis for recovering attorney fees. The taxpayer's suit alleged facts providing a basis for awarding attorney fees under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 182.090. Defendants were fairly alerted that attorney fees would be sought and no prejudice would result if fees were awarded. Defendants did not act unreasonably as the attorney general advised them to continue to enforce the statutes and rule. State officers were entitled to follow the opinion of the attorney general and, when acting in good faith, were protected, even if the opinion was in error. The taxpayer was not entitled to an award of attorney fees under the court's inherent equitable powers because the interest it sought to vindicate was individualized, peculiar, or pecuniary.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, that &sect; 314.290 violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution. Defendant's justification for the disparate treatment under &sect; 314.290 was that it was more difficult to collect taxes from nonresidents and that these difficulties resulted in a loss of revenue. The court concluded that defendant failed to show that in denying the deferral to all nonresidents exchanging for property outside Oregon, its response to those concerns bore a substantial relationship to relieving the state from the difficulty of collecting taxes from nonresidents.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers exchanged Oregon investment real property for Colorado investment real property in 1995. As a like-kind exchange, the taxpayers qualified for deferral of recognition of the gain realized for federal income tax purposes.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 314.290 (1995). For purposes of Oregon income tax, the statute precluded nonresidents from deferring gain recognition on a like-kind exchange where the newly acquired property was located outside of Oregon.

The court granted the taxpayers' motion for summary judgment, holding that &sect; 314.290(2)(b) violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged the authority of the State of Oregon to assess property taxes on both the land and improvements on a variety of federal and state constitutional grounds.

The county assessor correctly contended that the Oregon Constitution provisions relating to taxation were valid because the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, were reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. The tax court held that the county assessor was directed by the operation of Or. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed the assessed value of its real property, claiming the assessor failed to adequately reduce the assessed value of its property to reflect a lot-line adjustment and razed improvements. Plaintiff and defendant department of revenue cross-moved for summary judgment. The court held that Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11 imposed a maximum assessed value (MAV) on every assessable unit of property. Therefore, separate calculations were required for land and improvements. Under the language of the constitutional provision, taxation was based on &quot;each unit&quot; of property. Without adding the word &quot;taxable,&quot; which the court could not do, &quot;unit&quot; logically referred to the assessable unit. The court found that Or. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11 provided for revaluing of property under certain circumstances, by applying a ratio of MAV to real market value. Thus, new improvements to property could be revalued. The court held the intent of the public was not that the assessor revalue the land when revaluing the improvements. The court held that allowing defendant's interpretation of the law could produce inequities that would offend the sensibilities of any taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a decision by defendant Oregon Department of Revenue that the taxpayer's wages were not exempt from taxation under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.127(8) (1999), as the taxpayer was not a federal employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer worked as a contractor on a federal dam project, but was not a federal employee. The taxpayer claimed that his wages should have been exempt under Or. Rev. Stat. &sect; 316.127(8). The Department claimed the exemption was not available to the taxpayer, as he was not a federal employee. The taxpayer claimed that &sect; 316.127 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Oregon Constitution. The appellate court held that the analysis under either constitutional provision was the same. The statute would be upheld, if there was a rational basis for the state law. The appellate court noted that, by exempting federal employees from its tax basis, the Oregon Legislature prevented the federal government from having to intercede in state taxation; doing so was in the state's legitimate interest. Additionally, as long as there was any plausible basis for the legislature's exemption of the federal employees from the state income tax provisions, the statute would be upheld.</SPAN></P>
