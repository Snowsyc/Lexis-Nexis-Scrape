</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, an employer and its workers' compensation insurer, challenged a decision from respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (California), which awarded a death benefit under Lab. Code, &sect; 4702, subd. (a)(6)(B), to the estate of a deceased worker and also made an award to the state pursuant to Lab. Code, &sect; 4706.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent, who had no dependents, sustained a fatal injury in the course and scope of her employment. The court held that because Cal. Const., art. XIV, &sect; 4, did not identify estates as a class of beneficiaries entitled to workers' compensation death benefits, the Legislature was not empowered to promulgate Lab. Code, &sect; 4702, subd. (a)(6)(B), which was therefore unconstitutional. The plenary power clause of Cal. Const., art. XIV, &sect; 4, could not be used to expand the Legislature's power to award workers' compensation death benefits beyond the purpose of compensating dependents if a worker died in the course and scope of employment. Awarding death benefits to non-dependents did not further the underlying policy of the workers' compensation laws, which was to compensate workers and their dependents for a loss of earnings based upon death. Although death benefit awards to the state had been authorized by means of a state constitutional amendment, there was no such authority to award death benefits to deceased workers' estates. The term &quot;dependents&quot; in Cal. Const., art. XIV, &sect; 4, did not include a deceased worker's estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court annulled the award to the decedent's estate and affirmed the award to the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant local tax assessors challenged a judgment of the Orange County Superior Court (California), which found that legislation assessing a personal property tax against the managers of fractionally owned aircraft, Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect;&sect; 441, 452, 1160, 1161, 1162, 5368, was unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful in a suit filed by respondents, the sellers of fractional interests in jets who also managed the jets for the fractional owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the tax on the fractionally owned aircraft assessed by the legislation at issue was constitutional and lawful, as against the substantive challenges raised by respondents. Respondents controlled the fractionally owned aircraft within the meaning of the legislation because, among other things, the fractional owners could not transfer their interests in the aircraft without respondents' consent, and the fractional owners could not use the aircraft other than within the fractional ownership program. The fractionally owned aircraft had a sufficient connection with California to justify the imposition of taxes on them. The tax was fairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to services provided by California to respondents. The system by which the legislation allocated taxes on the fractionally owned fleets fairly distributed the tax burden among all the fractional owners of all the fractionally owned aircraft. The legislation constituted a new law regarding the assessment of taxes against the managers in control of fractionally owned aircraft fleets and, therefore, could not constitutionally be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and directed the trial court to enter judgments providing that the retroactivity provisions of the legislation were unconstitutional, but that the legislation was lawful and constitutional in all other respects challenged by respondents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city appealed a judgment of the Stanislaus County Superior Court, California, denying the city relief on its complaint to recover an alleged business license tax deficiency from defendant health maintenance organization (HMO).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that the city's business license tax ordinance that was operative for the tax years at issue was unconstitutional as applied to the HMO because it imposed a tax on business activities occurring outside of the city. The city did not appeal from the finding that its ordinance was unconstitutional. Rather, the city, which had amended its ordinance to provide for apportionment and had adopted apportionment guidelines, requested the instant court to remand the matter to the city's finance director for a recalculation of the HMO's alleged tax deficiency using the city's recently adopted apportionment guidelines. However, the instant court concluded that the city was not entitled to the remedy it sought. The underlying complaint was filed to enforce an alleged business tax deficiency that was based on the unconstitutional ordinance. When the city amended its ordinance to include an apportionment provision, it made a substantive change to this law. The amended ordinance specified that procedural changes be applied prospectively. Due process precluded reforming the amended ordinance to apply it retroactively to the HMO.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Costs on appeal were awarded to the HMO.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sonoma County Superior Court, California, entered a judgment declaring that Veh. Code, &sect;&sect; 14602.6 &amp; 23109.2, were unconstitutional on their face. The trial court also awarded plaintiff citizen $ 249,018.59 in attorney fees and costs pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1021.5. Defendant Attorney General of California appealed both the judgment and the order awarding attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen challenged statutory provisions pertaining to impoundment of vehicles that were either driven by unlicensed drivers or used in dangerous activities such as speed contests. The court concluded that the statutory phrase &quot;mitigating circumstances&quot; in Veh. Code, &sect; 14602.6, subd. (b), was not unconstitutionally vague on its face. The mitigating circumstances standard was reasonably specific and certain when viewed in context. The statute itself set forth examples of mitigating circumstances requiring release of an impounded vehicle prior to expiration of the 30-day period. Section 14602.6 did not, on its face, violate the equal protection clause. The statute did not violate the nondelegation doctrine because the legislature provided adequate direction for implementing the statutory directive to impound a seized vehicle for 30 days absent a showing of mitigating circumstances. The court also found Veh. Code, &sect; 23109.2, to be constitutional. When viewed in context, the last sentence of &sect; 23109.2, subd. (a), could reasonably be construed as a directive to impound a vehicle seized for 30 days unless one of the express statutory grounds for an earlier release was satisfied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 4604.5, subd. (d), on several grounds. The court rejected all of the worker's arguments, concluding that Cal. Const., art. XIV, &sect; 4, neither restricted the legislature's ability to limit the number of authorized chiropractic treatments nor expanded an injured worker's constitutional rights to include an entitlement to receive unlimited treatments. The court further concluded that a disagreement with an employer's refusal to approve excess treatments did not give rise to a legally cognizable dispute within the meaning of the second paragraph of Cal. Const., art. XIV, &sect; 4, because the employer's decision was discretionary. Allowing an employer to approve excess treatments did not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of power. Moreover, because an employer's decision was not tethered to any factual or legal dispute requiring adjudication, due process under either the California or federal constitutions was not implicated by Lab. Code, &sect; 4604.5, subd. (d). The court also found no merit in an alternative equal protection argument, holding that cost reduction provided a rational basis for the enactment of &sect; 4604.5, subd. (d).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer, a California corporation, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of San Francisco City and County, California, which dismissed its cause of action for a refund of taxes based on the Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 24402, dividends received deduction, following the sustaining of respondent California Franchise Tax Board's (FTB's) demurrer without leave to amend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment for the FTB on the taxpayer's claim for refund of the amnesty penalties under California's tax amnesty program, Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 19730 et seq. The court held that &sect; 24402, which had been found unconstitutional, could not be saved by severance of the offending language or by reformation. The FTB proceeded with proper authority to remedy the Commerce Clause violation infecting &sect; 24402, and the remedy of disallowing the dividends received deductions for the years at issue did not defy the due process prohibition against excessively retroactive tax increases. As well, the FTB's decision to recoup the deductions for those years did not run afoul of Cal. Const., art. XIII A, &sect; 3. On the amnesty front, the deficiency assessments for tax years 1999 and 2000 were &quot;due and payable&quot; within the meaning of Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 19777.5, thereby empowering the FTB to assess amnesty penalties for those years. Additionally, &sect; 19777.5 did not operate retroactively, and thus imposition of the amnesty penalty did not raise due process concerns. Finally, there was no statute of limitations bar to imposing the amnesty penalty for the 1999 tax year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned stock in a corporation that did business outside California. The taxpayer was not permitted to receive a dividend deduction under Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 24402, for dividends that had been declared on corporate income not taxed in California. After an unrelated case held that the limitation of the &sect; 24402 deduction to dividends from income on which California tax had been imposed violated the commerce clause, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, the taxpayer asserted that it should be allowed to receive the deduction. The taxpayer argued that the deduction could be extended to all dividends by severing most of &sect; 24402, subd. (a), pursuant to the severability provision in Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 23057, and declaring the remaining statute constitutional. The court held that the taxpayer's proposed revision of &sect; 24402, subd. (a), did not pass the volitional separability test. The legislative history showed that the Legislature intended to limit the deduction to dividends declared from income subject to California tax. Thus, the court could not rewrite or reform &sect; 24402, subd. (a), to provide the deduction to all taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance did not violate the public trust doctrine as it did not, in any real sense, implicate the public's right to access to public waterways. Rather, it regulated the use of certain equipment on the water. The coalition also failed to establish what effect, if any, the ordinance would have on interstate commerce. The ordinance was not preempted by the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971, 46 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 4301-4311, as the ordinance did not establish &quot;minimum safety standards&quot; for watercraft, and it was not preempted by the Federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 7401 et seq., as there was no evidence that the county was purporting to adopt standards and other requirements relating to the control of emissions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four individuals filed a complaint against defendants, the State of California and the California Department of Motor Vehicles, seeking refunds of smog impact fees.

Attorneys appealed from the order of the Superior Court of Sacramento County, California, granting the petition to vacate the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, the reviewing court determined whether the trial court erred in vacating the arbitration award of $ 88,479,713 for fees and expenses in settlement of a case that held a smog impact fee was unconstitutional. The reviewing court also addressed a challenge to the validity of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 6909(b), the statute that authorized the arbitration. Although the reviewing court recognized the limited scope of judicial review of an arbitration award, the case fell in the limited and exceptional circumstance justifying judicial review of an award that violated an explicit expression of public policy. An award of over $ 88 million in public monies pursuant to statutory authority for an arbitration in the settlement of an $ 18 million dispute was an unconstitutional gift of public funds. As such it violated both &sect; 6909(b), which authorized the arbitration, and the public policy set forth in Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 6, prohibiting gifts of public funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlords sought review of a judgment of dismissal from the Superior Court of Sonoma County (California), which sustained, without leave to amend, defendant city's demurrer to the landlords' action seeking to recover rents in excess of the rent control ceiling for a period during which an ordinance later found unconstitutional was in force.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords unsuccessfully attempted to apply to the city's rent board for a prospective adjustment of rents, but the city attorney refused to submit the application to the board because it did not allege the denial of a fair rate of return. The landlords then filed suit for inverse condemnation, a declaration that the ordinance had effected an unconstitutional taking, and a writ of mandate ordering the rent board to consider the application. The complaint did not allege that enforcement of the ordinance had deprived the landlords of a fair and reasonable rate of return on their investment. The court concluded that the landlords' complaint lacked sufficient allegations to support relief. The due process clauses of the California and federal Constitutions guaranteed property owners due process of law when the State deprived them of property, as set forth in Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 7, and U.S. Const., 14th Amend., &sect; 1. The takings clauses guaranteed just compensation when property was taken for public use, as provided in Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 19, and U.S. Const., 5th Amend. However, a rent control measure was confiscatory only if it deprived a property owner of a fair return.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that Pen.

The phrase &quot;locked into position&quot; in &sect; 16470 plainly means firmly fixed in place or securely attached so as to be immovable. The phrase &quot;locked into position,&quot; when given its plain and commonsense meaning, is sufficiently definite to provide fair notice to people of ordinary intelligence that in order for a concealed folding knife or pocketknife to be a dirk or dagger within the meaning of Pen. Code, &sect;&sect; 16470 &amp; 21310, the blade must be not only exposed, but also firmly fixed in place or securely attached so as to be immovable. However, there was no substantial evidence from which a rational trier of fact could reasonably find beyond a reasonable doubt that the fully opened or exposed blade of the concealed folding Swiss Army knife defendant was carrying at the time of his arrest was firmly fixed in place or securely attached so as to be immovable, such that it was locked into position within the meaning of &sect; 16470.

In view of the legislature's broad authority over employment, and the limited role of the courts in reviewing legislative policy decisions, the statutory scheme met the constitutional test for substantive due process review. The legislature regarded agriculture to be the state's most vital industry, and it could certainly act to protect that industry by promoting stability in agricultural employment. Because it appeared that there were peculiar problems with the collective bargaining process between agricultural employers and agricultural employees, there was a rational basis for the enactment of interest arbitration legislation applicable to agricultural employers and employees but not to employees of other businesses or industries. Thus, there was no equal protection violation. There was no unlawful delegation of legislative power, and the statutory scheme was not vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC), contending that the prohibition against public speech in Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 453(d) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility company included in its monthly billings a newsletter, the contents of which ranged from energy-saving tips to stories about wildlife conservation, and from billing information to recipes. The newsletters sent in June, July, and August of 1987 included information regarding federal regulations that appellant sought to have changed. The utility did not dispute that some of the subject matter discussed therein fell within the purview of &sect; 453(d). The real parties in interest, an independent energy producers' association and others, filed a complaint with the PUC, alleging that the utility had violated the statute by using its billing envelopes for political advocacy. The PUC ruled for complainants. The court of appeal held the statute was unconstitutional on its face, as it could only be interpreted as prohibiting the inclusion of political advocacy in billing envelopes and could not be justified as a permissible subject-matter regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the statute's blanket prohibition against protected speech was facially unconstitutional. Thus, the order enforcing the statute was set aside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county sheriff sought review of a summary judgment from the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California), which found the removal provisions of San Bernardino County, Cal., Ord. No. 3875 to be constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance dealt with removal of county officers, including the sheriff, and provided that removal for cause could be accomplished by a four-fifths vote of the board of supervisors. The ordinance stated that it could not be applied to interfere with the independent and constitutionally and statutorily designated investigative and prosecutorial functions of the sheriff and the district attorney. The court found the ordinance valid because the county had the right and duty to decide removal procedures for the sheriff. Pursuant to Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 4, a county charter had to provide for the compensation, terms, and removal of the sheriff. A county's constitutionally authorized powers included those powers necessarily implied from those expressed, as stated in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 23003. The challenged ordinance was consistent with the supervisory powers in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 25303 because it specified that there would be no interference with the sheriff's investigative and prosecutorial functions. Although sheriffs were elected officials, as provided in Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 4 and Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 24009, 24205, that status did not preclude removal by the board of supervisors.</SPAN></P>

Defendants, a bank and a special purpose trust, initiated the sale of such bonds. However, plaintiffs filed a reverse validation action, raising three constitutional challenges to the compact bonds. The Sacramento County Superior Court, California, entered judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiffs appealed. Defendants cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to address the issues raised in plaintiffs' appeal and defendants' cross appeal. Although the statutory directive for direct review to the California Supreme Court set forth in Gov. Code, &sect; 63048.8, subd. (e), was unconstitutional because it bypassed the jurisdiction conferred on the Courts of Appeal by Cal. Const., art. VI, &sect; 11, subd. (a), the court reformed the statute to provide that a petition for writ review in a Court of Appeal was the exclusive means to initiate appellate review of a judgment in a reverse validation action concerning contracts and the issuance of bonds authorized by the amended gaming compacts. The court declined plaintiffs' request to treat the appeal as a petition for writ of review. Plaintiffs already obtained such review by filing a petition for writ of review. The court's order summarily denying the petition was a determination on the merits that the reverse validation action was untimely. Because plaintiffs exhausted their sole method of review, their appeal was subject to dismissal. Defendants did not offer any reason why their cross-appeal should not also be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross-appeals were taken from a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which, in a declaratory action brought by plaintiff credit reporting agency, ruled that Civ. Code, &sect; 1785.11.2, was unconstitutional with respect to information included in consumer credit reports that was culled from public records. Defendants, the State of California and its Attorney General, separately appealed a post-judgment attorney fee award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The credit reporting agency provided consumer credit reports to landlords. The reports included public information such as records of unlawful detainer, bankruptcy, tax lien, foreclosure, and other public proceedings. The credit reporting agency asserted that &sect; 1785.11.2, which allowed California consumers to prevent the dissemination of their credit reports, violated its federal and state constitutional free speech rights. The court concluded that &sect; 1785.11.2 was unconstitutional, as applied to the credit reporting agency, under either a commercial speech or a noncommercial speech analysis. Section 1785.11.2 contained excessive restrictions because it restricted the credit reporting agency's truthful reporting of lawfully available and obtained public record information. Moreover, preventing the dissemination of the public record information did not serve the asserted state interest of preventing identity theft. Because &sect; 1785.11.2 could not reasonably be reformed to apply only to information derived from nonpublic sources, the statute could not be enforced in any respect as to the credit reporting agency. Section 1785.11.2 was not, however, facially invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, affirmed the attorney fee award, and remanded with directions to the trial court to issue a new injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The half-sibling and the mother's minor son had the same father. The half-sibling sought visitation rights with the minor after their father died. The mother opposed the petition. The trial court held that Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 3102 was unconstitutional because it infringed upon the liberty interest of the surviving parent over control of the minor. On appeal, the court affirmed. The half-sibling's petition suggested no compelling facts to overcome the presumption that the mother was acting in the minor's best interests. The court also rejected the half-sibling's argument regarding Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 3150. While it did indicate that certain circumstances existed that suggested the need to appoint counsel for a minor child, there was no suggestion of that need in this case, and the court refused to conclude that the interest suggested by the statute overcame the fundamental liberty interest of a fit parent to select the persons able to associate with his or her child. The court held that the trial court did not err in concluding that Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 3102, as applied to the facts, unconstitutionally infringed on the mother's liberty interest. The dismissal of the petition was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a sheriff, ammunition vendors, and related others, filed a suit against appellants, the State and the California Attorney General, and Department of Justice, challenging the constitutionality of Pen. Code, &sect;&sect; 16650, 30312, and 30345-30365. The Fresno County Superior Court (California) declared the challenged statutes constitutionally invalid and issued a permanent injunction against their enforcement. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged statutes regulated the sale, display, and transfer of handgun ammunition. The court held that the policy considerations underlying the void-for-vagueness doctrine weighed in favor of applying heightened scrutiny to the challenged statutes. The court found no basis from the text of the challenged statutes, their legislative history, the record on appeal, or elsewhere upon which to conclude there was a common understanding or objective meaning of the term &quot;handgun ammunition.&quot; Vagueness permeated the text of the statutes to the point where constitutional guarantees of due process were violated. The statutes failed to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed and a reasonably certain standard for enforcement of the law. Therefore, the statutes were void for vagueness. The trial court properly denied appellants' motion to tax costs as to respondents' filing fee for a preliminary injunction motion that was withdrawn because, notwithstanding the lack of merit in appellants' legal arguments, the trial court could have easily concluded the work respondents put into the motion was significant to the development and preparation of their motion for summary adjudication.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance did not implicate any freedom of association protections. The ordinance was neither overbroad nor vague. The ordinance, which did not involve a suspect classification or a fundamental right, did not violate equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The ordinance did not pose any conflict with the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment. The ordinance did not vest unfettered discretion in city officials and was not an unconstitutional prior restraint on the content of any speech or expression sought to be conveyed. The ordinance did not violate the individual liberties protected under Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 1.

Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1577 for interest due because the property was not timely delivered to the Controller. The trial court granted the holders' summary judgment motions under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1577.5, and the Controller appealed. The cases were consolidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holders remitted escheated property to the Controller before Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1577.5, forgiving interest due on such property that was not timely delivered to the Controller, was enacted. The appellate court held &sect; 1577.5 satisfied the standard for retroactive legislation, as the legislature expressly provided it was retroactive. The statute was intended to motivate holders of unclaimed property to surrender escheated property to the state, conferring a monetary benefit on the state which benefitted the public in general, creating a public purpose rendering the statute constitutional under Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 6, prohibiting the legislature from making gifts of public money. This public purpose did not apply to the holders, as they remitted the property in their possession before the statute was enacted, so the statute did not encourage them to surrender that property to the state, and the application of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1577.5 to them was unconstitutional, because a public purpose was not advanced. As to the holders, the statute did not primarily serve a public purpose and only incidentally benefit private individuals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">More than 30 days after the resolution was approved, the taxpayer filed an action to determine its validity. The taxpayer contended that the resolution imposed an assessment in violation of Cal. Const. art. XIII-D. The city demurred on the ground that the claim was time-barred under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 329.5, which provided a 30-day period to file an action contesting the validity of an assessment against real property for public improvements. The trial court sustained the city's demurrer without leave to amend. The court, in affirming, held that the limitations period of &sect; 329.5 was not abrogated by Cal. Const. arts. XIII-C, XIII-D and their implementing legislation,&nbsp;Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 53753. Moreover, because Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 329.5 contained express language as to the accrual of a cause of action, identifying the date the assessment was levied, the taxpayer could not rely on a continuous accrual theory. The court noted that it could not adopt a different date of accrual if a statute prescribed the date of accrual, as stated in Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 312.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered the business to make changes to its website. The court held that Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 116835, subd. (a), and Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, &sect; 17577.2, subd. (c), as applied to the business's Internet website advertising, were not unconstitutional under the first-tier approach to dormant commerce clause analysis because they did not have the practical effect of directly controlling commerce wholly outside California. A separate California website or a separate part of the business's general website could be established that informed California customers that the business's devices had not been certified by California and therefore no health or safety claims regarding drinking water could be made under California law about those devices. The two statutes, as applied to the business's Internet website advertising, also were not unconstitutional under the second-tier approach to dormant commerce clause analysis because the burden the statutes imposed on interstate commerce was not clearly excessive in relation to their putative local benefits. The court concluded the statutes did not violate the First Amendment as applied to the business's website advertising.</SPAN></P>

Lab. Code &sect; 4644(g) did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV by impeding the right to travel, or otherwise serving no rational purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sustained a work-related injury in California, then moved to Nevada. California refused to provide her with the same benefits a California resident, entitled to vocational rehabilitation due to a workers' compensation injury, would enjoy. The court concluded petitioner's right to travel was not penalized, and strict scrutiny of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4644(g) was not required. The court found no authority for the broad proposition that a state was required to pass prospective legislation to provide for the well-being of persons formerly residing in it, but were now resident elsewhere, or needed to include former residents in statutes passed to aid current residents. California's distinction between in-state and out-of-state vocational rehabilitation plans did not violate the equal protection clause since it bore a &quot;rational relationship&quot; to a conceivable legitimate state purpose. To reduce costs, California prohibited out-of-state plans unless it was more cost effective in order to offset additional administrative costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed. Depriving petitioner, a Nevada resident, injured in California, from receiving same vocational rehabilitation given to California residents was rationally related to a legitimate government interest and did not violate her right to travel or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

He further argued hearsay evidence was admitted and decision was unsupported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found in a drug-induced state and hospitalized.

While investigating, the officer learned numerous firearms were in appellant's home. He confiscated them pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 8102. Appellant was released after three days without a judicial commitment. Respondent sheriff's office then petitioned not to return the firearms. The lower court granted the petition, finding return would pose a threat to appellant and others, stating it was inappropriate for assault weapons to be in the hands of a mentally unstable person. The appellate court affirmed, as the court's findings were supported by substantial evidence and the challenged statute was a reasonable exercise of police protective power and not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Amended statute satisfied substantive and procedural due process, was reasonable limitation on property right and constituted reasonable exercise of police power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of fondling a patient's breasts during surgery and attempting to place her hand on his pants over his penis while she was in recovery. In affirming the conviction, the court held that there was no error in admitting evidence under Evid. Code, &sect; 1108, of defendant's prior sexual offenses. Section 1108 was not unconstitutional on its face and was not unconstitutional as applied, even though the alleged act took place in an operating room and thus arguably did not implicate the rationale that sexual offenses were often committed in secret. Another rationale for &sect; 1108 was that such crimes frequently resulted in credibility contests, and that was exactly the situation in the present case, in which the victim's credibility was a central issue. There was also no error in excluding defendant's expert testimony explaining his plea to a prior charge. Defendant was not entitled to a limiting instruction as to the victim's fresh complaint because he failed to request one, and even if the trial court erred in failing to give a limiting instruction, any such error was harmless. The victim testified, and therefore the jury did not have to rely on her secondhand statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow sued defendant physician and others for the wrongful death of her husband. The Stanislaus County Superior Court, California, reduced the jury's $6,000,000 noneconomic damage award to plaintiff to $250,000 pursuant to a defense motion made under Civ. Code, &sect; 3333.2, which was enacted in 1975. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that the reduction of her noneconomic damages constituted: (1) a violation of her equal protection rights under the U.S. and California Constitutions, and (2) a violation of her state constitutional right to a trial by jury. The court found plaintiff's contentions to be without merit. The California Supreme Court had already upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 3333.2, in Fein v. Permanente Medical Group, in which it concluded that the legislature rationally could conclude a medical malpractice crisis existed in 1975 that required legislative intervention to reduce medical malpractice costs, and that &sect; 3333.2 was rationally related to the cost reduction goal. The court observed that it is not the judiciary's function to determine whether constitutionally valid legislation has served its purpose. The court declined plaintiff's invitation for it to determine whether &sect; 3333.2 was rendered obsolete by subsequent events. Regarding plaintiff's right to a jury trial argument, the court noted that a plaintiff has no vested property right in a particular measure of damages, and that the Legislature possesses broad authority to modify the scope and nature of such damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Orange County, California, declared defendant minor, a first-time juvenile misdemeanant, a ward of the court under Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 602, after finding that he committed misdemeanor assault and misdemeanor battery. The juvenile court placed the minor on formal, supervised probation with conditions, including one forbidding him from associating with anyone who he knew to be on probation. The minor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor never requested the juvenile court to determine his eligibility for deferred entry of judgment (DEJ). The court found that, because the minor was a misdemeanant, the juvenile court did not err by failing to consider whether he was eligible for DEJ. The court held that the DEJ statutes,&nbsp;Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 790 et seq., did not violate the minor's right to equal protection of the laws. The classification of nonviolent juvenile felons rationally related to the law's purpose of forestalling or minimizing a predicted wave of juvenile crime by getting tougher on violent juvenile felons while, at the same time, targeting scarce resources toward rehabilitating nonviolent juvenile felons who could benefit from education, treatment, and rehabilitation, pursuant to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 791, subd. (b). The court concluded that the probation condition restricting the minor's association with persons known to him to be on parole was not unconstitutionally overbroad. The restriction was sufficiently related to the goals of (1) promoting the minor's rehabilitation and reformation, and (2) protecting the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the hotel failed to produce its records for inspection, the city council authorized the mayor to issue a subpoena. The hotel did not comply with the subpoena. The trial court determined that the tax ordinance, Vacaville, Cal., Mun. Code &sect;&sect; 3.16.010 - 3.16.120, was not unconstitutionally vague, the subpoena was not overbroad, and the city council had the authority to issue the subpoena. The court, in affirming, held that the lack of a scienter requirement in the ordinance did not render it unconstitutionally vague. The definitions in the ordinance were not vague, and any imprecision did not cause actual confusion. The wording of the ordinance did not make compliance impossible or promote arbitrary enforcement of the law. The subpoena was not overly broad and did not violate due process. Because matters relating to the investigation and enforcement of tax measures were proper legislative concerns, the city council did not err when it authorized the mayor to issue the subpoena and to apply to the superior court for enforcement of the subpoena pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 37104. Ensuring the performance of an audit of an uncooperative taxpayer was a valid legislative concern.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) entered judgment convicting defendant of attempted spousal rape in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was based on threats he made to his estranged wife that he would rape and kill her. On appeal he claimed that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422, which prohibited the making of criminal threats of inflicting immediate serious injury or death, was unconstitutionally vague because it did not advise individuals as to the particular threats proscribed. The court disagreed. The statute proscribed threats regarding the immediate infliction of death or serious injury. The court noted that the statute criminalized only serious threats that were intentionally made with the intent to place the victim in sustained fear for personal safety or the safety of immediate family members. The court held that such adequately advised individuals and law enforcement of the conduct prohibited. There was no requirement that a specific crime or statutory violation be threatened. An objective standard was to be sued to evaluate the reasonableness of the belief that great bodily injury would result from the threat. The court held that such objective standard provided a sufficiently reliable guide to individuals and law enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted defendant under Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11352, subd. (a), of sale of a controlled substance and also convicted defendant under Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11351.5, of possession of cocaine base for sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold crack cocaine to an undercover police officer. He argued that the higher sentence for possession for sale of cocaine base under &sect; 11351.5, as opposed to the sentence for possession for sale of powder cocaine under Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11351, violated substantive due process and his right to equal protection of the law under the federal and state equal protection clauses, U.S. Const., 14th Amend., and Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 7. The court stated that a rational basis test applied to equal protection challenges based on sentencing disparities and to substantive due process claims. Because the two drugs were not the same, there was no merit to defendant's argument that the distinct punishments for possessing each substance were different and disproportionate penalties imposed for the same crime. The court noted that numerous federal cases had rejected the argument that the distinction between the two forms of cocaine was irrational. Defendant did not establish a due process violation because there was rational support for the statutes, and no equal protection violation was shown because there was no treatment of similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded to the trial court with directions to conduct further proceedings on a discovery motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a school district, organizational entities, and certain individuals, sued governmental defendants, challenging the constitutionality of the California Romero Act, Ed. Code, &sect; 35900 et seq. The Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, found the Romero Act was unconstitutional and issued a writ of mandate prohibiting the implementation or enforcement of the Romero Act in its entirety. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mayor of a charter city sought control over a school district through state legislation. The legislature enacted the Romero Act, which transferred substantial power from the school board to the district superintendent, and granted to the mayor the authority to ratify the appointment of the superintendent. The court held that the Romero Act was unconstitutional. In the absence of any looming constitutional crisis, the unique circumstances of the district did not, alone, constitute a basis for depriving the citizens of the city of their right to an elected school board running the district. Therefore, the Romero Act violated Cal. Const., art. IX, &sect; 16. The Romero Act also violated Cal. Const., art. IX, &sect; 6, because it effectively granted to the mayor veto power over the selection of the superintendent. The legislature had no authority to transfer authority over any part of the school system to entities outside of the public school system. It was not permissible for the legislature to effectively transfer many of the powers of the school board to the mayor, based on its belief, hope, or assumption that he could do a better job. The provisions of the Romero Act were not severable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, minor school children, parents, a unified school district, and its board of education, challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Riverside County, California, that denied their petition for writ of mandate and that dismissed their complaint against respondents, the State of California, state agencies, and state officials, in their action that arose from a dispute between the parties over construction costs for school facilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a reasonable interpretation of Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, &sect; 1859.81, subd. (a), and Ed. Code, &sect; 17075.15, subd. (c)(1), was that all funds designated for constructing school facilities that were not otherwise encumbered, should be deemed &quot;available&quot; for a school district's matching contribution, regardless of which account the funds were deposited into. Accordingly, the SAB and the trial court properly construed the statute and the regulation. Substantial evidence supported the finding that the certificate of participation (COP) proceeds were not encumbered. Because &sect; 17075.15, subd. (c)(1), granted the SAB the authority to define &quot;available funds&quot; as including revenue received after a district was granted hardship status, the SAB did not act in excess of its authority when enacting &sect; 1859.81, subd. (a). The court concluded that &sect; 17075.15 and &sect; 1859.81, subd. (a), were not facially unconstitutional or unconstitutional as applied. Appellants had not demonstrated that the statute and the regulation inevitably posed a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional provisions and also had not shown discrimination or a discriminatory intent.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the statute violated Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 1(b), 11(a). The statute required counties and other local agencies to submit in some cases to binding arbitration of economic issues that arise during negotiations with unions representing firefighters or law enforcement officers. The court agreed that the statute deprived the county of its authority under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 1(b) to provide for the compensation of its employees. The court agreed that the legislature could impinge on local matters to a limited extent if the issue was of statewide concern but noted that the statute totally deprived the county of its authority to set employee salaries by authorizing arbitration regarding compensation.  The court also agreed that the statute violated Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11(a) because it delegated salary-setting authority to a private entity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Stanislaus County Superior Court, California, granted defendant city's motion for judgment on the pleadings after ruling that the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (CVRA), Elec. Code, &sect;&sect; 14025-14032, was facially unconstitutional. Plaintiff Latino voters, who alleged that the city's at-large method of electing city council members diluted their votes in violation of the CVRA, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the CVRA was race-neutral because it did not favor any race over others or allocate burdens or benefits to any groups on the basis of race. It simply gave a cause of action to members of any racial or ethnic group that could establish that its members' votes were diluted though the combination of racially polarized voting and an at-large election system - like the election system used by the city. The CVRA's facial terms were not subject to strict scrutiny. Only rational-basis review applied, and the CVRA readily passed it. Curing vote dilution was a legitimate government interest, and creation of a private right of action like that in the CVRA was rationally related to it. The CVRA was not an affirmative action law and did not burden the fundamental right to vote. The trial court erred in finding unconstitutional a provision of the CVRA allowing attorney fees to be awarded to prevailing plaintiffs. In reaching its decision, the trial court focused on an improbable set of hypothetical facts. The asserted invalidity of a single hypothetical application was not a proper basis for finding the fee clause invalid on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was the lifetime beneficiary of the income from a testamentary trust created by the grandfather, who died prior to the enactment of the California Powers of Appointment Act, Prob. Code, &sect; 600 et seq. The grandfather's will gave the father a power of appointment, providing that a portion of the assets from the trust would be distributed upon the father's death to the father's three children as appointed in the father's will. The court held that the father could not exclude the son because the applicable case law at the time the grandfather executed his will made the power of appointment nonexclusive, such that no heir within the appointed group could be excluded from at least a substantial share. Although Prob. Code, &sect; 652, provided for such exclusion, the court construed Prob. Code, &sect; 601, to require application of the previous case law, giving effect to the grandfather's presumed intent under Prob. Code, &sect; 21102, subd. (a). Moreover, it would be unconstitutional to apply &sect; 652 retroactively to the son's vested rights. The petition was not untimely under Prob. Code, &sect; 16460.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a limited liability company, owned a hotel. When all of the company's membership interests were sold, the assessor's staff investigated whether there had been a change in ownership of the hotel and determined that no person or entity had obtained, directly or indirectly, more than a 50 percent interest in the company. Nonetheless, the assessor reassessed the hotel. The court held that there had been no change in ownership for purposes of property tax assessment under Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect;&sect; 60, 64, subd. (a), because the exception in Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, &sect; 462.180, subd. (d)(1)(B), for interests exceeding 50 percent did not apply. A contract for the sale of the hotel that had been signed, never performed, and terminated did not result in equitable conversion or a change in ownership; the taxpayer had retained legal title, from which full beneficial title was presumed under Evid. Code, &sect; 662. Pursuant to Cal. Const., art. III, &sect; 3.5, and Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 538, subd. (a), the assessor could not reassess the hotel on a theory that the change in ownership legislation was unconstitutional without first prevailing in a declaratory relief action on that issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, remanded, and deferred the issue of attorney fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of Los Angeles enacted an ordinance regulating certain hotels near the airport with respect to mandatory service charges collected from customers; specifically, it required hotels to pass proceeds along to workers who rendered the related services. Plaintiff workers sued defendant hotels, seeking to enforce the ordinance. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, dismissed the suit, and the workers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the ordinance was preempted by Lab. Code, &sect;&sect; 350 through 356, provisions governing the disposition of gratuities. The court of appeal disagreed, concluding that the Labor Code did not preempt L.A. Mun. Code, &sect;&sect; 184.00 through 184.06, because the provisions regulating gratuities were not irreconcilable with the ordinance. A service charge was not a &quot;gratuity,&quot; as defined by &sect; 350, subd. (e), and the statutes and ordinance were intended to address different harms. The Legislature had not demonstrated an intent to regulate in the field of service charges. The court further concluded that there was no equal protection violation under a deferential, rational basis standard. Although the ordinance applied only to hotels in a particular business zone that had been designated for economic investment, the city rationally could have concluded that the designation benefited hotels, obligating them to pay service workers a decent compensation. There was also a rational basis for applying the ordinance only to hotels with more than 50 guest rooms and without unions. The ordinance also was not unconstitutionally vague and was not an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of dismissal with directions to overrule the hotels' demurrers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, issued a writ of mandate directing defendant California Commission on State Mandates to set aside its decisions affirming its executive director's rejections of test claims presented by plaintiffs, a county and cities, and to consider fully the claims and determine whether plaintiffs were entitled to reimbursement without consideration of Gov. Code, &sect; 17516, subd. (c). The Commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs cross-appealed. The court held that &sect; 17516, subd. (c), was unconstitutional to the extent it exempted regional water quality control boards from the constitutional state mandate subvention requirement. Its creation of an exception for regional boards, which were state agencies, contravened the plain, unequivocal, and all-inclusive reference to &quot;any state agency&quot; in Cal. Const., art. XIII B, &sect; 6. Moreover, a contrary conclusion was not compelled by virtue of the fact that &sect; 17516, subd. (c), essentially mirrored the language of Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 2209, subd. (c). A statute could not trump the constitution. The court found persuasive the Commission's position that should it conclude &sect; 17516, subd. (c), was unconstitutional, the appropriate remedy was to afford the Commission the opportunity to pass on the merits of the subject test claims on the issues of whether: (1) the subject permit qualified as a state mandated program under art. XIII B, &sect; 6; (2) the permit amounted to a new program or higher level of service; and (3) the permit imposed costs on local entities. The court concluded that plaintiffs' cross-appeal, which was simply protective in nature, was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an ongoing child custody proceeding, the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) ordered defendant father to pay a portion of the attorney's fees of plaintiff mother pursuant to Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 7640, a part of the Uniform Parentage Act, Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 7600 et seq. The father appealed, contending that Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 7640 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father contended that &sect; 7640 was unconstitutional on its face because it forced him to pay his adversary's attorney's fees irrespective of the merits of his case and even if he prevailed, solely because he had more money than the mother. The court affirmed the awards, holding that &sect; 7640 was constitutional because, even if it implicated fundamental rights, it served a compelling state interest of promoting the best interests of the child. The court stated that the requirement that the father pay attorney's fees was necessary to insure that the welfare of the child he fathered was protected by a presentation of all evidence bearing on the various issues that arose in the custody dispute. The court also concluded that the father failed to develop any viable &quot;as applied&quot; challenge. Although the father made many factual assertions about the case in his appellate brief, he had failed to present a factual analysis supported by citation to the record to demonstrate an unconstitutional application of the statute. The father also argued that the trial court wrongfully deprived him of the legal custody of his child. However, the custody orders were interim and not appealable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the attorney's fees awards. The court dismissed the appeal of a minute order and the purported appeals from the interim custody orders. The court denied the mother's request for sanctions. The court awarded the mother her costs on appeal. The court denied, without prejudice, the mother's request for attorney's fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff medical marijuana patients appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Tehama County (California), which sustained a demurrer filed by defendants, the county and its board of supervisors and various departments, and dismissed the patients' petition challenging the constitutionality of Tehama County Ordinance No. 1936.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance regulated the cultivation of marijuana and declared that failure to comply was a nuisance. The court noted that the ordinance was not subject to challenge under Cal. Const., art. II, &sect; 10(c), which applied only to statutory amendments by the Legislature, and that the proper analysis was one of preemption under Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 7. The court held that the ordinance did not conflict with either the Compassionate Use Act, Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.5, or the Medical Marijuana Program, Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.7 et seq., because neither statute had created a right to the unregulated cultivation of medical marijuana. The ordinance did not conflict with the immunity provided by Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 11362.765, 11362.775, which applied to the civil remedies of Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11570, because the ordinance did not declare a nuisance solely based on cultivating medical marijuana or associating to cultivate medical marijuana. Moreover, because there was no express statutory authority to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes without restriction or regulation, Civ. Code, &sect; 3482, did not bar the enforcement of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After their daughter died while proceedings were pending with respect to the dissolution of her marriage to plaintiff, defendant parents sought a court order giving them a visitation schedule with their granddaughter. The trial court granted them visitation with their granddaughter. On appeal, plaintiff contended the visitation order must be reversed because the statute that authorized it was unconstitutional. In the alternative, he claimed the trial court abused its discretion in ordering visitation. In light of the fact plaintiff was a fit parent who had not sought to cut off grandparent visitation completely, and in light of the absence of substantial evidence rebutting the presumption in favor of a fit parent's parenting decisions, the application of the statute to establish a schedule of visitation over plaintiff's objection unduly infringed upon his fundamental parenting right to make decisions about the care, custody, and control of his daughter. Because the visitation order violated the plaintiff's parental rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, the order was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grocery store sought to enjoin picketing by defendant labor union. The Superior Court of Fresno County, California, found that it was precluded from issuing a preliminary injunction by Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 527.3 (the Moscone Act) and Lab. Code, &sect; 1138.1. The store appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that the Moscone Act and Lab. Code, &sect; 1138.1, contravened the free speech provisions of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, by discriminatorily conferring speech rights on some, but not all, Californians without a compelling state interest. The state could not act to selectively create a free speech right applicable only to the few, while excluding all others, in the absence of a compelling state interest. The actual impact of the statutes was to discriminate: to provide a forum on both public and private property for speech related to labor disputes, while not providing the same forum (for example) for speech relating to the right not to be discriminated against based on race, sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Contrary to the union's argument, the issue was appropriate for consideration by the reviewing court because the constitutionality of the statutes was a matter of public interest; the store's assertion of its own interests as a property owner and its assertion of a public interest in nondiscriminatory legislation were sufficiently congruous; and a contrary conclusion would have deprived employers of any means of a judicial resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings on the motion for preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree murder by personal use of a deadly weapon; an amended complaint added a special circumstance alleging &quot;lying in wait&quot; pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(15). Respondent trial court found &sect; 190.2(a)(15) was unconstitutionally vague and granted defendant's motion to dismiss the lying-in-wait allegation. The State petitioned for a writ of mandate commanding the trial court to vacate its order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented for review was whether the change in the wording of the lying-in-wait special circumstance due to a voter-approved amendment, from murder committed &quot;while&quot; lying in wait to &quot;by means of&quot; lying in wait, rendered the special circumstance unconstitutionally vague; the instant court held that is did not. The facts of the case showed that defendant decided to kill his victim, established a ruse to take her by surprise, prepared a weapon he could conceal when he went to her home under the ruse, where he watched and waited for an opportune time to strike his unsuspecting victim. Any reasonable person considering defendant's conduct, or planning similar acts, would know that those acts constituted murder by means of lying in wait and that the special circumstance could be alleged if the person in addition specifically intended to kill his victim by such means. Accordingly, the instant court concluded the trial court erred in determining &sect; 190.2(a)(15) as amended was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant; thus, a writ of mandate was proper to reinstate such special circumstance for defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writ of mandate was issued directing the trial court to vacate its order granting defendant's motion to dismiss the allegation of special circumstances and to enter a new and different order denying the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff counties appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County, which concluded that the California Medical Marijuana Program Act (MMP), Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 11362.7-11362.9, and the California Compassionate Use Act of 1996 (CUA), Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.5, were not preempted by the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 801-904, and that the MMP was not invalid under the California Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The counties argued the MMP was invalid under preemption principles. The court determined the counties had standing to challenge only those limited provisions of the MMP that imposed specific obligations on the counties, such as the identification card provisions, Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.71 et seq., and could not broadly attack collateral provisions of California's laws that imposed no obligation on or inflicted any particularized injury to the counties. The court interpreted 21 U.S.C. &sect; 903 as preempting only those state laws that positively conflicted with the CSA so that simultaneous compliance with both sets of laws was impossible. Because the CSA law did not compel the states to impose criminal penalties for marijuana possession, the requirement that counties issue cards identifying those against whom California had opted not to impose criminal penalties did not positively conflict with the CSA and did not invalidate the identification laws under obstacle preemption. Further, because the MMP's identification card program had no impact on the protections provided by the CUA, those provisions were not invalidated by Cal. Const., art. II, &sect; 10, subd. (c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner California Attorney General sought a writ of mandate, requesting that the court direct respondent local public officials to comply with California's marriage statutes,&nbsp;Cal. Fam. Code &sect;&sect; 300-310, 350-360, 400-425, in issuing marriage licenses and certificates, declare invalid same-sex marriage licenses and certificates issued by the officials, and order a refund of any fees collected in connection with the licenses and certificates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officials refused to enforce the provisions of the marriage statutes that limited the granting of a marriage license and marriage certificate only to a couple comprised of a man and a woman. The court found that, under California law, the officials had no authority to refuse to perform their ministerial duty in conformity with the California marriage statutes on the basis of their view that the statutory limitation of marriage to a couple comprised of a man and a woman was unconstitutional. The officials exceeded their authority in issuing marriage licenses to, solemnizing marriages of, and registering certificates of marriage for same-sex couples. The court held that Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 300 clearly limited marriage in California to a marriage between a man and a woman and flatly prohibited persons of the same sex from lawfully marrying in California. Accordingly, the same-sex marriages that already had been performed were void and of no legal effect from their inception. If the applicable statutes were judicially determined to be unconstitutional in the future, same-sex couples would then be free to obtain valid marriage licenses and enter into valid marriages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a writ of mandate directing the officials to enforce the marriage laws unless and until they were judicially found to be unconstitutional. The officials were to take all necessary remedial steps to undo the continuing effects of the their past unauthorized actions, including making appropriate corrections to relevant official records and notifying all affected same-sex couples that their marriages were void and a legal nullity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court correctly held that the portions of Pub.

(b), and 20209.34, requiring that certain architectural and engineering work had to be performed by architects and engineers employed by California's Department of Transportation (Caltrans) were unconstitutional under Cal. Const., art. XXII. While the legislature had authority to implement a modified design-build process whereby an independent entity other than the designer-builder performed certain architectural and engineering reports and inspections, without violating Proposition 35, the legislature could not require that those reports and inspections be performed by civil service employees. Thus, Caltrans could choose to have that work performed by its employees, but the legislature could not mandate that Caltrans do so. While the court's conclusion was consistent with the essence of the trial court's judgment, the judgment was overly broad in that it invalidated the entirety of &sect;&sect; 20209.26, subd.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mother appealed a judgment of the San Diego County Superior Court, California, granting visitation of defendant's child to plaintiffs, the child's paternal grandparents, pursuant to Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 3102.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 3102 was unconstitutional, as applied, in light of the United States Supreme Court case of Troxel v. Granville, a case concerning the constitutionality of Washington's nonparental visitation statute. Plaintiffs argued that Troxel's analysis was inapplicable to &sect; 3102. The court first rejected plaintiffs' request that it not exercise its discretion to hear defendant's constitutional claim because she raised the issue for the first time on appeal. The court concluded that because defendant was a fit parent and willing to voluntarily schedule visitation, and the lower court erred in its application of a presumption that visitation was in the child's best interests, the application of &sect; 3102 over defendant's objections unduly infringed upon defendant's fundamental parenting rights. Although &sect; 3102 provided greater restrictions than the Washington statute on who could petition for visitation and also authorized a court to grant visitation to a child's grandparents solely upon finding that it was in the best interests of the child, the lower court could not substitute its judgment of a child's best interests for that of a competent custodial parent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed in its entirety, and the matter was remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate its order granting plaintiffs' request for a visitation schedule, and to enter a new order denying that request. Given plaintiffs' concession on a petition for writ of supersedeas, the visitation schedule was stayed. Plaintiffs were ordered to pay defendant's costs of appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed a judgment of the Los Angeles County Superior Court (California) denying plaintiffs' request for injunctive and declaratory relief. The trial court ruled that application of Hermosa Beach, Cal., Proposition E (1995) (Proposition E) to real party in interest's oil drilling project constituted an unconstitutional impairment of a lease agreement between real party in interest and defendant city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proposition E, adopted by the voters in November 1995, reinstated a total ban on oil drilling within defendant city. The issue in this case was whether Proposition E constituted an unconstitutional impairment of a 1992 lease agreement for oil and gas exploration and production on city-owned property entered between real party in interest and defendant. Plaintiffs argued that Proposition E applied to real party in interest's project. Defendant argued that Proposition E was not retroactive and did not apply to the oil drilling project and that application of Proposition E to the 1992 agreement constituted an impermissible impairment of contract. The appellate court held that application of Proposition E to the project did not constitute an unconstitutional impairment of the 1992 agreement. In the absence of necessary permits, real party in interest could claim no vested right to continue with the project. Proposition E was a legitimate exercise of defendant's police powers. Significant health and safety concerns supported application of Proposition E to the project. The trial court utilized an erroneous legal standard to evaluate Proposition E's reasonableness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion in this case, including a declaration that Proposition E was intended and did apply to real party in interest's project and that application of Proposition E to the project was a valid exercise of defendant city's police power that did not constitute an unconstitutional impairment of contract. Lead plaintiff was awarded its costs on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought a taxpayer action against defendant police chief and others, seeking to enjoin enforcement of Special Order 40 (SO40), a policy governing the police department's interaction with illegal immigrants. The Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, granted the chief's motion for summary judgment, upholding the validity of SO40. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that plaintiff's challenge to SO40 was facial only. Plaintiff cited to no instances in which an officer was disciplined for violating SO40. With no evidence that police officers actually were prohibited from voluntarily contacting the Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the sole purpose of discovering immigration status, plaintiff's challenge to SO40's constitutionality could not be characterized as an as-applied challenge. SO40 survived a facial challenge. Plaintiff failed to establish that SO40's provisions inevitably posed a total and fatal conflict with 8 U.S.C. &sect; 1373, a provision invalidating state and local restrictions on the voluntary exchange of immigration information with federal immigration authorities. A mere hypothetical conflict was insufficient. SO40 was not preempted by federal law. Without any indication that SO40 was actually interpreted to conflict with &sect; 1373, the court declined to find preemption based only on a hypothetical situation. Although plaintiff argued that SO40 violated Pen. Code, &sect; 834b, which governs law enforcement cooperation with ICE, the statute was itself preempted by federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's pimping conviction was based on an allegation that he unlawfully, and knowing a person to be a prostitute, lived and derived support and maintenance in whole or in part from the earnings and proceeds of that person's prostitution. The court of appeal rejected defendant's Fourteenth Amendment due process challenge. The prohibition against deriving support from the earnings of a known prostitute was directed at curbing the exploitation of commercial prostitution practiced by others and did not involve the offender's fundamental liberty interests. The prohibition was related to a proper legislative goal, and hence, was constitutional. Additionally, the evidence in the current case was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew that the person he lived with was a prostitute, that her earnings were secured from prostitution, and that defendant derived support, in whole or in part, from those earnings knowing his receipts were derived from her prostitution.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the Act constitutional but that regulations necessary to enforce it had not been adopted. The appellate court held the Act was not improperly vague without the adoption of regulations, and the legislature did not intend to require regulations. The non-consensual extraction of biological samples for identification purposes implicated state and federal constitutional interests, but those convicted of serious crimes had a diminished privacy expectation, the Act's intrusions were minimal, and the Act served compelling governmental interests. There was no basis for excluding the inmates from the Act's valid purpose of solving crimes, and the legislature did not have to assume the inmates could not commit crime because they were sentenced to death. The Act appropriately limited the use of the information obtained. The inmates' claim could be resolved as a matter of law on demurrer because they did not show the facially valid statute was unconstitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that defendant violated &sect; 290 by failing to register a woman's home as a residence. Such evidence included statements by defendant's neighbors that it appeared to them that defendant either was not living at his registered address or was there only part-time. The woman's neighbors testified they believed defendant had been spending nights or living at the unregistered address. In addition, the woman's brother, whose daughter was living with the woman at her house, testified he believed defendant was living there. The definition of the term &quot;residence&quot; adopted in Pen. Code, &sect; 290.011, subd. (g), was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. There was evidence defendant was spending a considerable amount of time at the unregistered address. There was also evidence defendant was informed that he was required to register any place where he regularly resided, regardless of the number of days or nights spent there. Under any plausible reading of &sect; 290.011, subd. (g), defendant was required to register the woman's home because he was regularly spending a significant amount of time there.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Res. Code &sect; 30166.5. The superior court granted intervenor taxpayers' petition, directing the city not to hold a referendum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With an LCP in place, the city shouldered the burden of processing coastal development permits; otherwise, the responsibility rested with the Commission. The city failed to implement an LCP within nine years after its incorporation as a city. The legislature thus enacted &sect; 30166.5, and the Commission wrote an LCP. The court held that &sect; 30166.5 was not unconstitutional as &quot;special legislation&quot; under Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16(b) and that the legislature acted properly. The legislature was entitled to select the city from among those that had not implemented an LCP. The State could solve a problem incrementally, starting with the worst offenders first. The bar to state preemption of local control of land use applied only to purely local concerns. The LCP embraced matters of statewide concern as it involved the California coast, one of the State's most important environmental and economic resources. Although the LCP would have been subject to a referendum if the city had drafted it, the legislature showed its intent to withdraw the right of referendum. Section 30166.5 intended the LCP to take immediate effect, and it assigned the power to enact the LCP specifically to the Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 (AWCA), Cal. Penal Code &sect;12275 et seq., in a suit to enjoin its enforcement. The trial court dismissed the action. The appellate court reversed, holding the AWCA unconstitutional on the following grounds: (1) &sect; 12276 violated equal protection; (2) &sect; 12276.5 violated separation of powers doctrine by delegating legislative power to the courts; and (3) AWCA violated due process because it was unduly vague. Defendant attorney general appealed, and the court reversed. Plaintiffs' facial challenge to the constitutionality of the statute was rejected, because they failed to demonstrate that the temporary suspension provision of the AWCA would present due process notice issues in the vast majority of cases. Upon the court's analysis of plaintiffs' equal protection challenge, the AWCA survived rational basis scrutiny. Finally, the separation of powers challenge failed, because the AWCA did not prevent the judiciary from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.</SPAN></P>

The court reinstated the trial court's order dismissing plaintiffs' challenge to the constitutionality of the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor violation of Cal. Health and Safety Code &sect; 11550, being under the influence of a controlled substance. He requested a competency hearing under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1368. Defendant moved for a competency finding and a declaration that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1367.1 was unconstitutional. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County denied his motion. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was the constitutionality of &sect; 1367.1, pertaining to evaluations of misdemeanor defendants whom a trial judge believed might have been incompetent to stand trial due to a mental disorder. Inter alia, &sect; 1367.1(b) and (c), required that a misdemeanor defendant was to have been referred for evaluation and treatment under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4011.6. Section 1367.1 also provided that, if treatment did not restore competence, the misdemeanor defendant was then subject to the same proceedings as was a felony defendant thought to have been incompetent to have stood trial due to a mental disorder. However, a felony defendant was not required to undergo evaluation and treatment prior to a competency determination. The Court of Appeal of California, Second Appellate District, Division Two, held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1367.1 deprived misdemeanor defendants of the equal protection of the laws and that it could not have been construed or reformed to have preserved its constitutionality. As &sect; 1367.1 was unconstitutional, competence issues regarding misdemeanor cases should have been handled according to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1368, the same as felony cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a redevelopment association, an association of California city officials, and related others, sought a peremptory writ of mandate, arguing that Assem. Bill Nos. 26 &amp; 27 (2011-2012 1st Ex. Sess.) were unconstitutional. Petitioners contended the measures violated, inter alia, Proposition 22.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Assem. Bill No. 26 was a proper exercise of the legislative power vested in the legislature by the state constitution. That power included the authority to create entities, such as redevelopment agencies, to carry out the State's ends and the corollary power to dissolve those same entities when the legislature deems it necessary and proper. Proposition 22, while it amended the state constitution to impose new limits on the legislature's fiscal powers, neither explicitly nor implicitly rescinded the legislature's power to dissolve redevelopment agencies. Nor did Cal. Const., art. XVI, &sect; 16, impair that power. A different conclusion was required, however, with respect to Assem. Bill No. 27, which conditioned further redevelopment agency operations on additional payments by an agency's community sponsors to state funds benefiting schools and special districts, because Proposition 22 (specifically Cal. Const., art. XIII, &sect; 25.5, subd. (a)(7)) expressly forbade the legislature from requiring such payments. Because the flawed provisions of Assem. Bill No. 27 were not severable from other parts of that measure, the measure was invalid in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition for a peremptory writ of mandate with respect to Assem.

The court directed issuance of a peremptory writ compelling the state Director of Finance and state Controller not to implement Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 34172, subd.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner railroad companies sought a writ of review to challenge a decision of respondent Public Utilities Commission (California), which determined that the railroad companies were in violation of the requirement of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad companies argued that Cal. Labor Code &sect; 6906(b) was repealed by implication when the California Anti-Featherbedding Law, Cal. Labor Code &sect; 6900.5, was enacted. Although the Commission found merit in that assertion, it ordered the railroad companies to comply with the statute because it believed that, pursuant to Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3.5, it could not refuse to enforce Cal. Labor Code &sect; 6906(b). The court concluded that Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3.5, which prohibited an agency from refusing to enforce a statute on constitutional or federal law grounds, did not prohibit an agency from refusing to enforce a statute that was inconsistent with another statute. Moreover, such refusal did not violate the separation of powers doctrine expressed in Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. Accordingly, the Commission could refuse to enforce Cal. Labor Code &sect; 6906(b). The court determined that enforcement of &sect; 6906(b) had the effect of requiring railroad companies to employ workers in an obsolete position and, in so doing, violated the Anti-Featherbedding Law. As the later-enacted statute, the Anti-Featherbedding Law prevailed, thereby repealing Cal. Labor Code &sect; 6906(b) by implication.</SPAN></P>

(a)(4), which prohibited the carrying of a concealed dirk or dagger. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute proscribing the carrying of a concealed dirk or dagger did not run afoul of the Second Amendment because it was narrowly tailored to serve the important governmental interest of preventing exposure to the risk of surprise attacks and did not burden the right to bear arms in self-defense beyond what was reasonably necessary to serve that interest. The statute did not apply to the open carrying of a dirk or dagger and excluded from its coverage an openly-suspended sheathed knife, as well as nonswitchblade folding and pocketknives kept in a closed or unlocked position. The statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The court concluded that culpability for accidental concealment was precluded under the principles of general intent, which required that a defendant intentionally commit the prohibited act. Because the offense did not include a requirement of specific intent to conceal the instrument from other persons, the trial court had no duty to instruct on that element. The trial court also properly instructed the jury on general intent, which encompassed the requirement of an intentional, not accidental, act of concealing the weapon.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect; 37104 et seq., requiring the production of records necessary for a tax compliance audit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax in question was a transient occupancy tax, a 10 percent tax upon stays of 30 days or less at hotels, motels, and like accommodations within the city. The hotel operators argued that they should not be required to produce the records because the taxing ordinance was unconstitutional and because the subpoenas were invalid. The court concluded that the subpoenas were proper. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it clearly described the circumstances in which it applied. The ordinance did not violate equal protection. Liability for the tax depended solely upon the duration of occupancy. The subpoenas were issued in furtherance of the city's lawfully authorized concern of carrying out the audit of an uncooperative taxpayer to determine compliance with the ordinance. The material sought was pertinent to the tax compliance audit and was set forth in detail in the subpoenas. The subpoenas did not authorize actual entry or immediate inspection, but gave the hotel operators the choice of opening their books at reasonable times or producing them in the future. The hotel operators also had the opportunity for judicial review to challenge the subpoenas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a non-tribal gaming business entity and one of its employees, sued defendant Governor of California and other government officials, challenging the constitutionality of Assembly Bill No. 687 (AB 687) (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.), which ratified amended gaming compacts between the State of California and five Indian tribes. The Los Angeles County Superior Court, California, entered a judgment of dismissal. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the various theories raised in plaintiffs' complaint were properly the subject of a timely reverse validation action. Under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 860, plaintiffs should have brought such an action within 60 days of the enactment of AB 687. The amended compacts were inextricably intertwined with the state's intended use of the income stream created by them and with the bonds to be issued at a later date. Therefore, the ability of the tribes and the state to accomplish the statutory purpose of AB 687 would be substantially impaired absent a prompt procedure for validating the amended compacts. Because plaintiffs waited nearly 11 months to file suit, their action was time-barred. The court also concluded that the matter was not filed timely on appeal. Because plaintiffs' lawsuit was subject to the time limits specified for validation actions, the time for filing their notice of appeal was governed by Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 870, which required plaintiffs to file their notice of appeal within 30 days of notice of entry of judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) for felony possession of child pornography, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311.11(b). He filed an appeal, challenging the constitutionality of the statute, and the court's denial of his motions to suppress evidence and to disclose an informant's identity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of felony possession of child pornography. The court of appeal affirmed, holding first that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 311.11 was not unconstitutionally vague, because there was no unconstitutional delegation of authority to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The MPAA had been given the power only to determine that a film carrying an MPAA rating was not illegal under &sect; 311.11; this protected only putatively innocent purchasers of commercial films. There was also no privacy right to the possession of obscene material. Second, there was sufficient evidence that appellant knowingly possessed the images found in his computer. Third, the affidavit supporting the search warrant contained sufficient allegations to support probable cause, and the identity of the confidential informant did not need to be disclosed. Appellant's suggestion that it might have been the informant who downloaded the pornography was pure speculation, and in any event, appellant admitted to the officer that he had downloaded it himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction, holding that (1) the statute prohibiting possession of child pornography was not unconstitutionally vague and did not violate appellant's right to privacy; (2) there was sufficient evidence that appellant knowingly possessed the images found on his computer; and (3) the identity of the confidential informant did not need to be divulged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers' group sued defendant Franchise Tax Board, alleging that Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 19138, was unconstitutional under Cal. Const., art. XIII A, &sect; 3, for not meeting the two-thirds legislative requirement for a state tax increase, and was also unconstitutional on due process grounds. The Sacramento County Superior Court, California, upheld the statute's constitutionality. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 19138, which was a corporate tax penalty for understating such taxes by more than $ 1,000,000, was not subject to the two-thirds legislative vote requirement for a &quot;state tax&quot; increase as required by Cal. Const., art. XIII A, &sect; 3. In line with being a penalty, &sect; 19138 directly raised revenue only if a corporate taxpayer had disobeyed a legal obligation (by understating its actual tax liability by over $ 1 million). Furthermore, the continuous decline, over time, in projected revenue from &sect; 19138 concretely illustrated this aspect of penalty: As more corporations fully paid their taxes to avoid the penalty, the penalty revenue declined. Section 19138 imposed a penalty for understating tax liability. It did not impose an increase in the tax rate or a change in the method of tax computation. The court further concluded that the statute, as properly construed, afforded due process. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, &sect; 19382, provided a constitutionally adequate post-deprivation remedy in the form of a judicial refund action in which taxpayers could contest the validity of the tax penalty under &sect; 19138.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brandished a firearm during a traffic dispute. Investigating officers saw defendant, who was standing on the sidewalk in front of his family's residence, remove a loaded handgun from his pocket and place it inside a vehicle parked in the driveway. The sidewalk was within 1,000 feet of a high school. Defendant argued that the sidewalk was on his father's private property, subject to an easement of way granted to a public entity. The court affirmed, holding that a sidewalk on an easement of way granted to a public entity did not qualify as private property within the meaning of the Cal. Penal Code &sect; 626.9(c)(1) exception for lawful possession on private property. Moreover, &sect; 626.9 was not unconstitutionally vague because any property interest owned by defendant's father was not of a sort that a reasonable citizen would understand to be private. An instructional error was harmless because the sidewalk was not private property within the meaning of &sect; 626.9 as a matter of law and because defendant, having violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12031(a)(1) by carrying a firearm in a public place, was not entitled to claim the exception of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 626.9(c)(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county sought writ relief from an order of respondent Superior Court of Sonoma County (California), which compelled the county to arbitrate with real party in interest, a union representing the county's law enforcement officers, and granted the union's request for a declaration that Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1299 et seq., was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties' negotiations over a new agreement reached an impasse, and mediation was unsuccessful. The county denied the union's request for interest arbitration. The court held that the union was not entitled to arbitration because &sect; 1299 et seq. impermissibly intruded upon the authority of a local governing body under Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 1, subd. (b), to establish compensation and terms of employment for county employees. The court construed the term &quot;governing body&quot; in accordance with Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 15, and Civ. Code, &sect; 12, to mean a majority of the governing body. A board of supervisors consisted of five members as provided in Gov. Code, &sect; 25000, subd. (a); thus, approval by three members was necessary for valid action under Gov. Code, &sect; 25005. Because Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1299.7, subd. (c), permitted the county board of supervisors to veto the arbitration panel's decision only by a unanimous vote, it improperly allowed a minority to approve the decision. Moreover, Code Civ. Proc., &sect;&sect; 1299.4, subd. (a), 1299.6, subd. (b), 1299.7, subd. (b), offended Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 11, subd. (a), by delegating to the arbitration panel the power to interfere with county money.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the superior court to (1) vacate the portions of its order that had granted the union's petition to compel arbitration and that had made a declaration of constitutionality, and (2) enter a new and different order denying the union's petition to compel arbitration and granting the county's cross-motions for a declaration of unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an apartment association, sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which dismissed the association's suit against defendants, a city and its city council, challenging the validity of an ordinance that modified existing requirements on multifamily housing construction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance required developers constructing multifamily ownership housing projects in a multifamily residential district to construct affordable housing on the site of the development or at another location. The association contended that this requirement was a facially unconstitutional taking under U.S. Const., 5th Amend., and Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 19, based on the lack of a nexus or rough proportionality between the construction of market-rate housing and the shortage of affordable housing. The court stated that case law did not permit use of the nexus and rough proportionality test when conducting a facial attack on land use regulations. This test applied only to land exaction takings litigation involving individual adjudicative permit approval decisions, not to generally applicable legislative general zoning decisions. Thus, the association was not entitled to a trial on its constitutional challenge. The court further held that the ordinance did not require approval by the Department of Housing and Community Development under Gov. Code, &sect; 65585, because the ordinance did not amend the city's housing element.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff opponents of a referendum on an ordinance restricting second-story additions (anti-referendum group) sued defendant city, seeking a writ of mandate directing the city clerk to certify the referendum as insufficient, or, alternatively, directing the city council not to place the referendum on the ballot. The Orange County Superior Court, California, allowed the referendum election to go forward. The anti-referendum group appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proponents of the referendum (pro-referendum group) hired a signature gathering firm to obtain the signatures of the minimum 10 percent of registered voters in the city necessary to subject the ordinance to a referendum. The circulators hired by the signature gathering firm had each petition signer also sign a separate declaration of circulator portion of the petition, the idea being that each signer was his or her own &quot;circulator.&quot; The anti-referendum group argued that by allowing the referendum to go forward, the trial judge &quot;voided&quot; Elec. Code, &sect;&sect; 9209 &amp; 9238. The court concluded that the circulator declaration statutes were unconstitutional. The pro-referendum group presented substantial evidence that city clerks around the state routinely accepted petitions where signers acted as their own witnesses and signed as their own circulators, and this practice had not been previously challenged in litigation. The only reason that the pro-referendum group had signers also witness their own signatures as circulators was because Elec. Code, &sect; 9238, subd. (c), had unconstitutionally restricted the pool of circulators to a tiny fraction of what it constitutionally should have been.</SPAN></P>

On the facts, the state supreme court agreed with the court of appeal that the so-called good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply. The sparse record is the case was inconclusive regarding the source of the error. The state supreme court reasoned that suppression of evidence seized pursuant to police computer errors encouraged law enforcement agencies to diligently maintain accurate and current computer records.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeal of California, Sixth Appellate District affirmed a trial court's decision that denied appellant property owners' writ petition alleging a taking claim and seeking to have (1) an ordinance of respondent county amended and certain restrictions therein removed, and (2) conditions imposed on the owners' development permits declared invalid and removed. The claims were found to be untimely under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65009(c)(1)(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Santa Cruz, Cal., County Code &sect; 13.10.681(e) allowed residential property owners to construct affordable second dwelling units on their property, but the ordinance restricted the income of second unit tenants and the rent that could be charged. The owners filed a petition for a writ of mandate and challenged the ordinance. The trial court denied the writ and the appellate court affirmed on statute of limitations grounds. The court affirmed in part. To the extent that the owners' action rested on the allegations that the county exceeded its lawful authority by imposing the permit conditions and requested relief, the action came within Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65009(c)(1)(E). Because the action was brought almost 11 months after two owners' permit application was approved, the action was untimely as to their claim of invalid permit conditions. Because the action was brought within 90 days of the final administrative action on the other owner's permit, the action was timely as to this owner's claim that the conditions imposed on the permit were invalid. The remaining challenges to the ordinance were untimely under the applicable Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 338(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed as to the claims challenging the validity of conditions imposed on one property owner's permit and seeking removal of the conditions. The court affirmed the decision that the rest of the claims were untimely. Because the appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of the writ solely on statute of limitations grounds and did not address the determination that the takings claim was also without merit, remand was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The natural parents were never married to one another. The stepfather married the mother when the child was young. Upon the dissolution of the stepfather's marriage to the mother, the child visited the stepfather regularly. The mother sought to terminate the stepfather's visitation, alleging that he intended to relocate and that out of town visits were not in the child's best interest. The father intervened, also seeking to terminate the stepfather's visitation. The trial court found that it was in the child's best interest to visit the stepfather and ordered visitation pursuant to Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 3101. The trial court did not indicate how much weight it accorded to the natural parents' decision. The court, in reversing, held that &sect; 3101 was unconstitutionally applied because the record did not show that the trial court applied a presumption favoring the natural parents' decision that visiting the stepfather was not in the best interest of the child. In accordance with the fundamental right of parents to raise their children, fit parents were presumed to act in the best interests of their children, and trial courts had to give parents' decisions special weight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the visitation order and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought a petition for writ of mandate to compel defendant county sheriff's department to deliver a semiautomatic rifle to him. The Kings County (California) Superior Court denied the writ, holding the rifle to be an assault weapon proscribed by the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act, 1989 Cal. Stat. ch. 19, &sect; 3, p. 64 (AWCA). The Court of Appeal reversed, and the sheriff's department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an attorney, received a gun collection that included the semiautomatic rifle in payment for legal services. The sheriff's department refused to deliver it based on the AWCA. The trial court, applying the law before amendments passed in 1999, found that the differences between plaintiff's rifle and one of the models specifically listed in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12276(a)(1)(A) were only minor, thus satisfying the test for a &quot;series&quot; weapon stated in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12276(e). The court of appeal reversed, because the rifle had not been identified as an AK series assault weapon in the identification guide or the list of assault weapons promulgated by the attorney general. The supreme court affirmed the court of appeal, holding that the trial court exceeded its authority in declaring plaintiff's rifle an AK series weapon under &sect; 12276(a)(1)(A) and &sect; 12276(e). However, because the attorney general now asserted that the rifle was an AK47, one of the assault weapons specifically listed in &sect; 12276(a)(1)(A), and plaintiff in his petition had described the rifle as an &quot;AK-47 2822,&quot; the case was remanded to the trial court for resolution of that question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals as to the requirements for identifying and listing specific models of assault weapons, but remanded for further factual determination of the rifle's actual classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) that affirmed the approval of a view restoration permit in accordance with Rancho Palos Verdes, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 17.02.040.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action arose when one neighbor petitioned for a view restoration permit, which required appellant, the other neighbor, to trim his trees. Rancho Palos Verdes, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 17.02.040. The administrative agency conducted a hearing and granted the permit. Appellant exhausted his administrative remedies and sought review in the trial court, which affirmed the permit. The appeal followed. It was well settled that the state could legitimately exercise its police powers to advance aesthetic values. Ordering appellant to trim his trees did not violate the respective takings clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, as he was not deprived of any significant economically beneficial use of his land. Finally, contrary to appellant's claim, there was not automatic retroactive reach of the ordinance. Only when his neighbor applied for a view restoration permit did the inquiry begin to determine whether his trees should be trimmed to a lower height. Further, a substantial amount of vagueness was permitted in California zoning ordinances in order to permit delegation of broad discretionary powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; the ordinance was clearly a legitimate exercise of the city's traditional police power. Appellant had not been ordered to destroy his trees, but simply to trim them at the petitioning party's expense, and thus it was not a taking. Lastly, the ordinance was not deceptive, unclear or uncertain and thus not vague.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 37.10A(c), (g) to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged provisions prohibited landlords from making bad faith threats of eviction and also provided that a tenant's waiver of rights was void unless the tenant was represented by independent counsel. The court, in affirming, observed that content-based regulation of speech was presumptively invalid and could be upheld only when it was necessary to serve a compelling state interest and had been narrowly tailored to serve that end. Although the municipality argued that the regulation was permissible because it addressed false commercial speech, the court found that the regulation penalized certain types of speech regardless of whether that speech was motivated by economic considerations. Thus, both commercial and noncommercial speech were regulated. Moreover, the provision also regulated speech that was neither false nor inherently misleading, and it was not narrowly tailored to serve the governmental interest. The waiver restrictions deprived tenants of the right to self-representation in a civil proceeding, derived from the constitutional rights to defend one's property and to obtain access to the courts; hence, the regulation was preempted under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, who was sexually assaulted by a police officer on more than one occasion while participating as a minor in a police department's explorer program, sued defendant city, alleging it was vicariously liable for the officer's negligence based on his breach of the mandatory duty to report the sexual abuse under Pen. Code, &sect; 11166, subd. (a). The Stanislaus County Superior Court, California, sustained the city's demurrer. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend. The court held that imposing a duty on a mandated reporter who abused a child to report that abuse would require the mandated reporter to forfeit his or her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Therefore, under Pen. Code, &sect; 11166, subd. (a), the officer was not required to report his own sexual assaults. Because the officer did not breach a mandatory duty in the course and scope of his employment, there was no basis to find the city vicariously liable for plaintiff 's injuries. The court concluded that the public safety exception to the Miranda rule did not impose a duty on the officer to report his own criminal behavior. A custodial interrogation was not involved, and there were no exigent circumstances. There was no justification for holding that the officer waived his Fifth Amendment privilege merely because, as a police officer, he was a mandated reporter under California's Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act, Pen. Code, &sect; 11164, et seq. To so rule would render &sect; 11166, subd. (a), unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals from four juvenile court orders of the Superior Court of Sonoma County (California), appellant, the maternal grandmother of two minors, sought review of the denial of two petitions for modification of custody under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 388, issuance of a restraining order barring the grandmother from having contact with the minors and their foster parents, and termination of the grandmother's de facto parent status.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the children were in foster care, the grandmother made unauthorized contact with them, hired investigators to report to her on their activities, videotaped their foster home, and publicly criticized their foster parents. The court dismissed one of the appeals as untimely, concluding that the grandmother had waived any claim that the commissioner who issued the order was acting as a referee rather than as a temporary judge, which would have extended the time for appeal. Modification of custody was properly denied because the grandmother failed to demonstrate, pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 388(a), 361(c) and Cal. R. Ct. 1432(f) that a change in her personal circumstances made her an appropriate caretaker for the minors. Her allegations about the unfitness of the foster parents were unsubstantiated. There was sufficient evidence that the grandmother had been stalking the minors and the foster parents for purposes of imposing a Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 213.5 restraining order, and the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The grandmother's actions demonstrated that she no longer met the requirements for de facto parent status under Cal. R. Ct. 1401(a)(8), 1412(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed one of the appeals as untimely and otherwise affirmed the orders, decisions, and determinations of the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect; 12020, subd. (a)(4), based on his carrying a knife hidden under his sweatshirt. The Superior Court of San Diego County, California, sentenced him to four years for the concealed-carrying offense (double the two-year middle term pursuant to an admitted strike prior) and one year for an admitted prison prior. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the prohibition on carrying a concealed dirk or dagger in former &sect; 12020, subd. (a)(4) (now Pen. Code, &sect; 21310), did not facially violate the Second Amendment right to bear arms in self-defense because the statute was narrowly tailored to serve the important governmental interest of preventing exposure to the risk of surprise attacks and did not burden the right to bear arms in self-defense beyond what was reasonably necessary to serve that interest. The statute did not violate the Second Amendment as applied to defendant, despite his claim that he could not afford a permissible self-defense weapon. There was also no duty to instruct on specific intent to conceal. No proof concerning intent was required beyond proving that a defendant intentionally and knowingly committed the proscribed act of carrying a concealed dirk or dagger. Further, the trial court properly instructed the jury on general intent, which encompassed the requirement of an intentional, not accidental, act of concealing the weapon. Findings on the prior prison term and strike allegations were vacated because defendant was not properly advised of his rights before he admitted the priors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as to the conviction, reversed as to the findings on the prior prison term and strike allegations and as to the sentence, and remanded the case for redetermination of the prior prison term and prior strike allegations and for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect; 6500, following a jury finding that the patient was a mentally retarded person, was a danger to himself or others, and had serious difficulty controlling his dangerous behavior because of his mental retardation. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that the patient's appeal was technically moot because the commitment had expired but nevertheless exercised its discretion to consider the meaning of the term &quot;danger&quot; under Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 6500. On the merits, the court held that the &quot;danger&quot; referenced in &sect; 6500, at a minimum, had to involve conduct that presented the likelihood of serious physical injury. The vagaries of emotional injury, mere apprehension of physical injury, speculation and conjecture were not enough to justify the need for commitment. Any other conclusion would have permitted involuntary civil commitments under &sect; 6500 in violation of a person's fundamental due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Shasta County, California, of failing to register as a sex offender after changing his name, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 290(f)(3). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he used two different names and explained that he did so to avoid harassment and find employment. He argued, however, that he did not abandon the name under which he was convicted of rape and that the phrase &quot;changes his or her name&quot; in &sect; 290(f)(3) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. The court disagreed. Applying the common sense meaning of the word &quot;changes,&quot; the facial language of &sect; 290(f) was sufficiently certain to notify defendant that his conduct would require him to reregister as a sex offender. There was no doubt that going from using a single name to using two distinct names made defendant's name &quot;different.&quot; The court rejected the argument that &sect; 290(f)(3) impermissibly allowed the jury to resolve its meaning on an ad hoc and subjective basis, outside any standard of reasonable certainty. The jury was correctly instructed that &quot;name change&quot; and &quot;alias&quot; had no legal definition and that the point at which a name change occurred was a factual question. The court commented on the absurdity of the notion that an offender could assume a new identity, or even multiple identities, but would need only to report under his original name.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Ventura County (California), which, in a proceeding brought by respondent grandparents pursuant to Prob. Code, &sect; 1516.5, declared the father's minor child free from his custody and control.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents, who were unmarried, consented to the appointment of the paternal grandparents as the child's guardians. Several years later, the grandparents sought to adopt the child. The father argued that &sect; 1516.5 was unconstitutional, in violation of substantive due process, both on its face and as applied to him. The trial court terminated the father's parental rights without a finding of parental unfitness. The court held that &sect; 1516.5 was not unconstitutional on its face, as it would not violate the due process rights of an unwed father who had failed to demonstrate commitment to his parental responsibilities. There was no equal protection violation because parents whose children had been in the physical custody of a guardian for two years or longer were not similarly situated to parents whose children had not been placed in a guardianship. Section 1516.5 was, however, unconstitutional to the extent it was applied to unwed fathers who demonstrated a full commitment to their parental responsibilities. The 2002 amendment of Fam. Code, &sect; 3041, which added &sect; 3041, subd. (c), superseded any suggestion that a finding of detriment under &sect; 3041 was equivalent to a finding of unfitness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded with instructions to the trial court to determine whether the father had demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he had made a full commitment to his parental responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city attorney sought a judicial declaration relieving him of his duty under Elec. Code, &sect; 9203, subd. (a), to prepare ballot titles and summaries for two ballot measures that would have directed the city council to exercise its judgment to craft and adopt laws relating to chain stores and affordable housing. The Superior Court of Ventura County, California, sustained defendant proponent's demurrer and denied his anti-SLAPP motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city attorney filed suit 20 days after the statutory time for compliance with Elec. Code, &sect; 9203, subd. (a), had passed. The trial court found that the suit was filed too late. The reviewing court reversed that holding. An official's refusal to act under Elec. Code, &sect; 9203, could be retroactively validated by a judicial declaration that the measure should not be submitted to the voters where the official came to court of his or her own accord seeking judicial authorization for the decision and where the claim was brought within a reasonable period of time after it had become clear that attempts to avoid litigation had failed. The court also held that the action did not qualify under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 425.16, as a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) because the city attorney demonstrated that he was entitled to judgment in his favor as a matter of law. The proposed initiative measures were an improper exercise of the electorate's initiative power under Cal. Const., art. II, &sect; 8, because they did not contain actual statutes or ordinances but rather were in the nature of resolutions that declared policies without providing the specific laws to be enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order sustaining the proponent's demurrer to the complaint, affirmed the order denying his anti-SLAPP motion, and directed that on remand, the trial court enter judgment in favor of the city attorney.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The California Court of Appeal reversed defendants' judgments for filing a knowingly false report of a criminal offense by finding that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 148.5 did not apply to complaints asserting misconduct by police officers and that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 148.6 was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 148.6 was not unconstitutional. The appellate court found that knowingly false statements of fact were proscribable when applied to false accusations against police officers, as the potential harm of a knowingly false statement was great. The legislature may criminalize only knowingly false accusations against a class of victims, peace officers. Knowingly false accusations of misconduct against a peace officer had substantial secondary effects--they triggered mandatory investigation and record retention requirements. The legislature was not suppressing all complaints of police misconduct, only knowingly false ones. No one had a constitutional right to make a complaint of misconduct knowing that the complaint had to be investigated and that it was false. Section 148.6 proscribed only knowingly false statements. Section 148.6 applied only to formally filed accusations that the agency had to investigate, not to more casual speech. Accusations that &sect; 148.6 covered were not as formal as statements made under penalty of perjury, but the punishment for such accusations that were knowingly false was also not as serious.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was involved in an accident during the coverage period of both policies.

(g), in any manner that differed from the statute's effect on every other insurer, there was no merit to its assertion that the legislation violated its right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const., 14th Amend. The involvement of the primary insurer in drafting the legislation did not amount to a due process violation under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the policy was issued after the enactment of Ins. Code, &sect; 11580.9, subd. (g), the contracts clause, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10, was not implicated. Given the weakness of the excess insurer's case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying further discovery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a former employee of respondent bank, sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which denied his motion to strike the bank's defamation complaint pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute,&nbsp;Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 425.16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee posted several comments on an Internet message board criticizing the bank and its management. The court held that the employee's comments were not illegal as a matter of law under Fin. Code, &sect; 1327, and thus were not excluded from the reach of the anti-SLAPP statute. The court found &sect; 1327 to be facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment, U.S. Const., 1st Amend., because it was a criminal libel statute that lacked an actual malice requirement, was vague and overbroad, and was a content-based law not narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of preventing bank panics. The employee's statements qualified as protected activity under &sect; 425.16, subd. (e)(3), because they were made in a public forum and addressed the financial stability of the banking system, a topic of considerable public interest. The bank failed to establish under &sect; 425.16, subd. (b)(1), a probability of prevailing on its claim for defamation because the employee's statements consisted of true factual assertions combined with statements of opinion. The message board was one where the average reader would expect to find rants and exaggerations, rather than objective facts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded to the trial court with directions to issue a new and different order striking the bank's complaint and to award the employee his attorney fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Riverside County Superior Court, California, convicted two defendants of violating Pen. Code, &sect; 502.5, by taking improvements or fixtures from their foreclosed home. The trial court placed defendant on probation for five years on condition they serve jail time of 270 days. The trial court ordered payment of probation supervision costs as a condition of probation. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court concluded that &sect; 502.5 is not unconstitutionally vague on its face. Average people can understand the concept of an &quot;improvement&quot; to property, the condition of being &quot;attached or affixed,&quot; and that &quot;premises&quot; refer to the encumbered property. The statute makes clear that the issue is whether the item is attached or affixed to the encumbered property at the time the defendant takes, removes, or disposes of it. The trial court correctly instructed the jury on the &sect; 502.5 offense and the related definition of fixtures from Civ. Code, &sect; 660. The trial court instructed the jury on the requirement that each defendant have acted with the specific intent to defraud or injure the trustee or beneficiary under the deed of trust. The trial court also properly instructed the jury on the great taking enhancement under Pen. Code, &sect; 12022.6, subd. (a)(1). The trial court should have ordered defendants to pay probation costs as a separate order, rather than as a condition of probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court modified the trial court's probation order to eliminate any requirement that defendants pay the costs of probation as a condition of probation, but affirmed the imposition of those costs, and directed the trial court to enter a separate order directing defendants to pay such costs. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California) sustaining defendants' demurrer to plaintiff's complaint which alleged that certain statutory provisions enacted to facilitate defendant county's recovery from bankruptcy violated Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 9, 16; and Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 53724(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant county filed for bankruptcy, the legislature enacted four recovery provisions allocating certain property and sales tax revenues to defendant county's general fund that were previously allocated to other public agencies of defendant county. Plaintiff brought an action seeking declaratory relief that the recovery provisions violated Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 9, 16; and Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 53724(e). The trial court sustained defendants' demurrer to the complaint. Plaintiff appealed and the appellate court affirmed. Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16 prohibited legislation applicable solely to a particular county only if a general statute could have been made applicable, leading the appellate court to conclude that the recovery provisions did not violate art. IV, &sect; 16. The legislature did not violate art. IV, &sect; 9 when it added new code sections without restating each of the statutes that were changed by the enactment. There was no violation of &sect; 53724(e) because the identified taxes were general, rather than special, taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment sustaining defendants' demurrer to the complaint was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alameda County Superior Court, California, entered a judgment enjoining governmental defendants from enforcing Senate Bill No. 1137 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.), which sought to amend Proposition 36, the California Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000. The trial court declared Senate Bill No. 1137 invalid in its entirety. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that certain of the sections of Senate Bill No. 1137 could not reasonably be construed to further the purposes of Proposition 36, and that Senate Bill No. 1137's provision for a popular vote, if any part of Senate No. Bill 1137 was invalidated, was itself invalid. Provisions of Senate Bill No. 1137 allowing incarceration for drug-related probation violations, when that sanction would be prohibited by Proposition 36, were inconsistent with the Proposition's purposes. Proposition 36 diversion was intended to: (1) promote public health by expanding treatment for drug addiction and abuse; (2) enhance public safety by freeing jail cells for violent criminals; and (3) save money by affording treatment in lieu of incarceration. Senate Bill No. 1137 contravened the second and third of those purposes because the amendment would reduce the jail space available for violent criminals and increase the costs incurred in connection with nonviolent drug possession offenders. Senate Bill No. 1137 undermined Proposition 36's comprehensive scheme insofar as it expanded the ability to incarcerate defendants for first and second drug-related probation violations.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect; 11362.77. The California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Three, reversed, concluding that &sect; 11362.77 was unconstitutional in its entirety, and that &sect; 11362.77, must be severed from the state's Medical Marijuana Program (MMP). Review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that insofar as &sect; 11362.77, of the Medical Marijuana Program (MMP) burdens a defense under the Compassionate Use Act (CUA) to a criminal charge of possessing or cultivating marijuana, it impermissibly amends the CUA and in that respect is invalid under Cal. Const., art. II, &sect; 10, subd. (c). A person who meets the definition of a qualified patient or primary caregiver under the CUA person may assert, as a defense in court, that he or she possessed or cultivated an amount of marijuana reasonably related to meet the patient's current medical needs without reference to the specific quantitative limitations specified by the MMP. The CUA did not grant the legislature authority to amend. The legislature adopted the MMP on its own, without seeking ratification by the electorate. Section 11362.77's quantity limitations conflict with - and thereby substantially restrict - the CUA's guarantee that a qualified patient may possess and cultivate any amount of marijuana reasonably necessary for the patient's current medical condition. Nonetheless, it would be inappropriate to sever &sect; 11362.77 from the MMP and hence void that provision in its entirety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To the extent the judgment of the appellate court purported to sever &sect; 11362.77 from the MMP and to void this statute in its entirety, the judgment was reversed. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the trial court of willfully and unlawfully carrying a concealed dirk or dagger in violation of Cal Penal Code &sect;12020(a).

The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and, on further review, the court also affirmed. The court concluded that the relevant language of Cal. Penal Code &sect;12020 was unambiguous and established that the crime of carrying a concealed dirk or dagger did not require an intent to use the concealed instrument as a stabbing weapon. On that basis, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in failing to give the jury instruction at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">People appealed from an order of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), setting aside an allegation that defendant, in the course of committing sodomy by force in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with residential robbery and forcible sodomy. At the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the magistrate found that binding the victim's head with tape was not tying and binding. Because defendant's actions came within the statutory prohibition on tying or binding of the victim during the course of the forcible sodomy he committed, in that binding the victim's head with tape rendered her more vulnerable, the superior court erred in setting aside the tying or binding allegation. The court found that one aware of the statutory proscription against the tying or binding of the victim could readily determine, using no more than the normal and customary meaning of the words, that actions such as wrapping the victim's head in tape (binding the victim's head) resulted in the perpetrator's exposure to an enhanced sentence for the underlying sexual offense committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order setting aside tying or binding allegation reversed. Statute sufficiently apprised persons of ordinary intelligence what conduct was prohibited. Binding victim's head with tape rendered her more vulnerable, and came within statutory prohibition on tying or binding of victim during forcible sodomy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motorist, whose car was impounded pursuant to Veh. Code, &sect;&sect; 14602.6 &amp; 22852, filed a class action suit against governmental defendants, alleging the statutory impoundment scheme, violated constitutional principles of equal protection, due process, and freedom from unreasonable seizures. The Sonoma County Superior Court, California, rejected the motorist's claims and entered a stipulated judgment against him. The motorist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist's car was impounded after the motorist was arrested for driving while his license was suspended due to his previous conviction for driving while intoxicated. The court concluded that the motorist's contention that the exclusion of certain license suspensions from the impound scheme violated equal protection principles lacked merit. The distinctions drawn by the legislature between suspensions that could cause a 30-day impoundment and those that could not were rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in reducing highway accidents, and were not so under or overinclusive as to violate constitutional principles of equal protection. The impound scheme did not violate due process or effect an unconstitutional seizure. The hearing procedure provided by Veh. Code, &sect; 22852, adequately reconciled the competing interests of the parties: the private interest in avoiding the cost and disruption entailed by impoundment of one's automobile; the relatively low risk of erroneous deprivation given the straightforward nature of most of the determinant factors; and the governmental interest in efficiently and effectively keeping the most dangerous drivers off the road.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city taxpayer appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Joaquin County (California), which sustained, with leave to amend, a demurrer to the taxpayer's first amended complaint, which sought to enjoin defendants, a city and its city attorney, from enforcing Stockton, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 5-1000 et seq., which dealt with seizure and forfeiture of motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance allowed the city to seize and hold for forfeiture any motor vehicle used to solicit an act of prostitution or to attempt to consummate a drug transaction. The vehicle could be seized upon a peace officer's probable cause determination that the ordinance had been violated. As worded, the ordinance did not provide for any judicial determination of probable cause on the validity of the seizure until the forfeiture trial, which in practical effect, would not occur for a minimum of several weeks. The court held that the ordinance violated the procedural due process guarantees of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because it contained no provision for a reasonably prompt post-seizure probable cause hearing on the validity of the city's right to detain the vehicle. The fact that an owner could institute a judicial proceeding for the return of the property was no substitute. In addition, the drug-related vehicle forfeitures authorized by the ordinance were impliedly preempted by the state's comprehensive scheme regulating the same subject, as set forth in the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act (UCSA), Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11000 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to overrule the city's demurrer to the second and eighth causes of action of plaintiff's first amended complaint and to enter judgment for the taxpayer declaring the city's ordinance invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, owner of a home damaged in the Northridge, California earthquake of January 17, 1994, appealed from summary adjudication by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, in favor of defendant insurers. The superior court had found that the owner's breach of contract action was untimely under Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 2071 and under the one-year limitations period contained in the earthquake policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Within days after his home was damaged, the owner was told by an insurance agent over the phone that his covered losses would not exceed the deductible on his earthquake insurance policy. When the owner discovered significant structural damage a year later, he sued. After the trial court granted summary adjudication to the insurers on limitations grounds, the owner appealed. While the appeal was pending Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 340.9, which revived certain claims arising out of the earthquake, became effective. The appellate court held that Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 2071 was not applicable, and that the contractual limitation of one year was revived by revival statute. Applying a three part contract impairment analysis the court found first, that revival of the owner's contract-barred earthquake claims impaired the insurer's contract only to the extent that they lost the limitation defense for one year. Secondly, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 340.9 had a significant, compelling and legitimate public purpose, and thirdly it was reasonably limited in both time and application. Application of the statute to the owner did not impermissibly impair the insurers' contract rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the superior court, noting that the revival statute revived the owner's claims for bad faith, breach of fiduciary duty, and punitive damages as well as his claim for breach of contract, because each of the claims was an insurance claim for damages arising out of the earthquake.</SPAN></P>

Meanwhile, parties settled and employees of appellee sought writ of mandamus to force collection of fees, which the court granted. Appellant sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and a refund of fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, environmental review filer, argued that the environmental review flat fees charged on those who submitted project proposals to appellee California Department of Fish and Game constituted a tax and, therefore, was unconstitutional on its face because the statute was passed by slightly less than a two-thirds majority. The court held that the legislature did not run afoul of the super-majority requirement of Cal. Const. Art. XIII A when it imposed a flat fee. The court determined that the flat fee was a regulatory fee and not a tax as plaintiff asserted. The court was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that the cost of comprehensive environmental review far surpassed the amount of fees generated under Cal. Fish &amp; Game Code &sect;711.4, and therefore, was a legal use of state regulatory fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was dismissed because the court found the flat fee was constitutional on its face as a regulatory fee. The appeal from the writ of mandamus was dismissed as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real parties in interest, the proponents of an initiative measure, filed an emergency petition for writ of mandate challenging the removal of the measure from the ballot by the California Court of Appeal, Division Three, which, in response to a challenge by petitioners, energy producers and others, ruled that the measure could not be adopted through the initiative process. The court directed that the measure be placed on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The measure, which would have conferred additional regulatory authority upon the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC), was defeated by the voters. Although the defeat of the measure made the challenge moot, the court concluded that it was appropriate to issue an opinion in order to provide guidance for the future. The court stated that deferring judicial resolution until after an election often proved to be the wiser course, even though the strong presumption against preelection review did not apply to a claim that a measure was not one that properly could be enacted by initiative. In light of the historical liberal construction of the initiative power as set forth in Cal. Const., art. IV, &sect; 1, and Cal. Const., art. II, &sect; 8, subd. (a), references in the California Constitution to the authority of the legislature to enact specified legislation included the people's reserved right to legislate through the initiative power. Accordingly, a reference to the legislature's plenary power in Cal. Const., art. XII, &sect; 5, did not preclude the people, through their exercise of the initiative process, from conferring additional powers or authority upon the PUC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeal and remanded to that court with directions to dismiss the proceeding as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, proponents of an initiative to roll back water and sewer rate increases, sought review of an order from the Superior Court of Riverside County (California), which denied their special motion to strike pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 425.16, respondent water district's declaratory relief action challenging the initiatives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district presented uncontradicted evidence that the initiatives, if enacted, would set water rates too low to pay the district's costs. The court held that a declaratory relief action concerning the validity of an initiative arose out of protected activity, within the meaning of &sect; 425.16, subd. (b)(1), because such an action implicated the personal constitutional rights of the initiative's proponents under Cal. Const., art. II, &sect; 8. The district properly brought a declaratory relief action under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1060, rather than a challenge to the ballot material under Elec. Code, &sect; 9380, because the district was not a voter or elections official and was challenging the initiatives, not the ballot material. The exclusive delegation rule did not preclude basing future rate increases on the consumer price index, nor was this provision vague because the applicable index could be ascertained. The district showed a probability of prevailing on its claim that the initiatives were invalid because they would set rates lower than permitted by Wat. Code, &sect; 31007, which was not a permissible use of the local initiative power to reduce fees under Cal. Const., art. XIII C, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Superior Court of San Diego County, California, convicted defendant of pimping and of eight counts of money laundering under Pen. Code, &sect; 186.10, subd. (a). Defendant appealed the money laundering convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ran an escort service. Each money laundering charge involved, within a 10-day period, cash deposits into, and checks written from, a checking account with initially low balances. In affirming, the court held that a prosecution based on a criminal proceeds theory required proof that: (1) the entire business was illegal; (2) there were deposits of $ 5,000 or more in criminally-derived funds; or (3) there was a transfer of all funds out of the account. It was not sufficient to show a transaction of more than $ 5,000 from an account with commingled funds. In the case at bar, the evidence was sufficient that there were deposits of $ 5,000 or more in criminally-derived funds. Defendant's testimony about his music businesses did not indicate that those businesses generated profit and thus did not support a finding that they supplied the cash deposited. The claim that 40 percent of the escort service's business was legal did not mean that 40 percent of the deposits were from legal activities, given that fees for sexual services were several times the fees for legal escort services and the fact that the escort business was inextricably intertwined with the prostitution business.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the six-month limitations period of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3514.5 applied to unfair practices charges filed with the PERB on or after the effective date of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3509. Charges based on unfair practices that occurred before the effective date were timely when filed with the PERB within the six-month period, provided that the charges were not barred by the previously applicable three-year limitations period of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 338(a). Accordingly, the charge was timely filed. There was no unconstitutional retroactive application of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3509 because a reasonable filing period was provided and liability for past unfair practices was not altered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs challenged provisions of Proposition M, a voter-approved initiative amending San Francisco's Residential Rent Stabilization and Arbitration Ordinance, S.F. Admin. Code, &sect; 37.1 et seq. The Superior Court of San Francisco City and County, California, upheld the decrease in housing services provisions of Proposition M, except for one phrase, but invalidated the attorney fees provision. Both plaintiffs and defendant city sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the decrease in housing services provisions added to the ordinance by S.F. Admin. Code, &sect; 37.10B, subd. (a)(4)-(15), were an attempt to bypass the judicial system and impermissibly endowed the San Francisco Rent Board with judicial power constitutionally reserved to the judiciary. As such, &sect; 37.10B, subd. (a)(4)-(15), was facially invalid under the judicial powers clause, Cal. Const., art. VI, &sect; 1, to the extent it empowered the Board to order rent reductions. The court found S.F. Admin. Code, &sect; 37.10B, subd. (a)(5) &amp; (6), to be content neutral, and not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. Moreover, &sect; 37.10B, subd. (a)(5) &amp; (6), was a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction on speech. However, &sect; 37.10B, subd. (a)(7), was invalid in its entirety because, even assuming it restricted commercial speech, it did not survive &quot;intermediate scrutiny&quot; under Central Hudson and unconstitutionally infringed First Amendment speech rights. The court concluded that &sect; 37.10B, subd. (c)(6), was invalid in its entirety because the city had no authority to mandate that attorney fees be awarded in unlawful detainer cases brought under state law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part and affirmed in part the judgment. The court directed the trial court to grant plaintiffs' petition for writ of ordinary mandamus, in part, and to issue a writ of mandate consistent with its opinion, and likewise to enter judgment consistent with its opinion as in plaintiffs' declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sellers appealed an order from the Superior Court of Ventura County (California), which granted preliminary injunctive relief to plaintiffs, the California Attorney General and the Ventura County District Attorney, prohibiting the sellers from making sales without first complying with the disclosure provisions of the Seller Assisted Marketing Plan (SAMP) Act, Civ. Code, &sect; 1812.200 et seq., and with Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, &sect; 17537.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sellers marketed products that purported to help purchasers start, operate, and maintain home-based businesses. Their sale presentations and website contained representations regarding the possibility of earning income from the businesses that far exceeded the initial cost of the products and services purchased. The sellers informed prospective purchasers that the results reflected in the testimonials were not typical and that there were no guarantees of income. The court held that the SAMP Act applied because the sellers' representations that it was possible to earn incomes exceeding the cost of the products and services fell within the definition of a SAMP in Civ. Code, &sect; 1812.201, subd. (a). Moreover, this definition was not void for vagueness because the terms &quot;will earn, is likely to earn, or can earn&quot; plainly encompassed any representations regarding a prospective purchaser's ability to earn an amount in excess of the purchase price. The trial court acted within its broad discretion under Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, &sect;&sect; 17203, 17535, in issuing the injunction, which was prohibitory and not mandatory because it did not compel the sellers to surrender any rights lawfully held.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, People of the State of California (the People), brought an action for abatement of public nuisance against defendant farming company.

Defendant appealed, alleging error by the trial court in a number of pretrial rulings on plaintiff's in limine motions and the constitutional issues raised in defendant's affirmative defenses. The court held that plaintiff Central California Tristeza Eradication Agency's decisions on how aggressively to remove trees, the timing of that removal, and whether compensation should be paid, all constituted an exercise of judgment and discretion in the implementation of the legislature's mandate. The court affirmed, also holding that the Citrus Pest District Control Law, Cal. Food &amp; Agric.

The court found no violation of equal protection under U.S. Const., 14th Amend., and Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 7, subd. (a), because the city reasonably could have determined that previous registration was a valid predictor of future law-abiding behavior. The ordinance was not preempted by state law pursuant to Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 7, because neither the Compassionate Use Act, Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11362.5, nor the Medical Marijuana Program Act, Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 11362.7 through 11362.83, created a broad right to use marijuana or occupied the entire field of medical marijuana use. The ordinance did not implicate due process concerns because there was no protected right and no summary enforcement procedure. The ordinance did not violate the right to privacy under Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 1, because closely regulated businesses, such as those dispensing drugs, had a reduced expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile offender, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Tulare County (California), which placed the juvenile on probation for disturbing the peace and resisting, delaying, or obstructing a peace officer. The trial court concluded that the charges were gang related and ordered the juvenile to register as a gang member pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 186.30(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile challenged &sect; 186.30(b)(3) on vagueness grounds. The court rejected that argument, observing that a definition of &quot;criminal street gang&quot; was set forth in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 186.22(e), (f). As part of the same statute, this definition provided a limiting construction of the word &quot;gang&quot; in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 186.30(b)(3), thus avoiding vagueness. Although the juvenile's constitutional argument lacked merit, the court found no substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that the juvenile's offenses were gang-related. The record contained evidence that the juvenile belonged to a gang and that he committed the offenses while in the company of other gang members. There was no showing of the requisite two predicate offenses, however, and the commission of enumerated offenses was not shown to be a primary activity of the group. The court noted that a remand would not violate double jeopardy and that the requirement of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 186.32 to provide information to the police did not violate constitutional provisions regarding due process, self-incrimination, free speech and association, privacy, delegation of authority, or cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment with respect to the order to register, affirmed in all other respects, and remanded to the juvenile court for a new disposition hearing.</SPAN></P>
