</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk (Connecticut), upon a conditional plea of nolo contendere, to possession of narcotics with the intent to sell by a person who was not drug-dependent and possession of narcotics, after the denial of his motion to suppress. He was sentenced to six years in prison and six years of probation. Defendant was also convicted of failure to appear and forgery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the police subjected him to an illegal stop that constituted an unconstitutional seizure. The appellate court held that the stop was an investigatory stop under the state and federal constitutions. Defendant's car was legally parked on the street. The police drove past defendant's car in a marked patrol car, turned the patrol car around, and parked behind defendant's car. One officer approached defendant's car on the driver's side, while the other officer approached on the passenger's side. A reasonable person would not have felt free to leave. The seizure was not based on a reasonable and articulable basis of suspicion. There were no criminal allegations or predictive information in an anonymous tip, upon which the police were dispatched. Although defendant's car fit the description in the tip, the police witnessed no suspicious or criminal activity that would warrant further investigation. The initial detention was, therefore, illegal. Finally, the evidence should have been suppressed. It was impossible to separate the illegal seizure from the evidence collected. The police did not have a reasonable suspicion to approach defendant's car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed only with respect to the charges of possession of narcotics with the intent to sell by a person who was not drug-dependent and possession of narcotics. The case was remanded with direction to grant defendant's motion to suppress and for further proceedings according to law. The judgments were affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

Appeal from the decision by the named defendant dismissing the plaintiff's employment discrimination complaint against the defendant Roman Catholic Diocese of Norwich, brought to the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Britain, where the court, Hon.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff priest challenged a decision of defendant Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities dismissing his complaint, which alleged employment discrimination under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-60 against defendant diocese. The Superior Court, New Britain, Connecticut, found that neither state agencies nor state courts had subject matter jurisdiction to review purely ecclesiastical disputes and dismissed the priest's challenge. The priest appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission's dismissal of the priest's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was based on a ministerial exception with respect to individuals employed by religious institutions in a ministerial capacity. The appellate court recognized this exception in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes such as &sect; 46a-60 because the constitutional guarantee of free exercise of religion required courts and government agencies from exercising jurisdiction over a religious institution's actions regarding the employment of its clergy and ministers. The appellate court declined to look to federal caselaw interpreting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000bb et seq., as persuasive guidance for the position that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-571b had displaced the ministerial exception, federal precedent, while often persuasive, was not binding on Connecticut courts. Rather, the appellate court found that the employment practices of religious institutions were a form a religious belief for purposes of &sect; 52-571b(d), which prevented the application of the strict scrutiny test of &sect; 52-571b(a) and (b), and thus did not displace the ministerial exception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hired both victims at different times to work in a bakery. Defendant allegedly grabbed both victims in a back room and sexually assaulted them. Neither victim knew the other. Defendant argued that the two cases did not involve discrete, easily distinguishable factual scenarios and that he suffered substantial prejudice as a result of the consolidation which was not cured by the trial court's inadequate instructions to the jury. The appellate court agreed. The similarities in both cases were significant enough to impair defendant's right to the jury's fair and independent consideration of the evidence in each case. Thus, defendant suffered substantial prejudice from the consolidation of the two cases. The trial court failed to instruct the jury that it could not use or consider the evidence from one victim's case in determining whether to convict on the other case. It moreover did not clearly advise the jury to distinguish the charges relating to the first victim from the charges relating to the second victim. Thus, the instruction did not adequately cure the prejudice. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-92(a) was not unconstitutionality vague as applied to defendant's conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Judicial District of Tolland (Connecticut), which dismissed plaintiff's appeal from the decision of defendant, a town planning and zoning commission. The main issue presented by plaintiff was whether plaintiff's challenge to a 1998 amendment of the town's zoning regulation on the ground that there was improper public notice was time barred by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(r).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owned property upon which it desired to develop multi-family housing units. The regulation at issue that was amended limited the number of multi-housing units on any parcel. The trial court dismissed the appeal as untimely pursuant to &sect; 8-8(r), which required any appeal to have been brought within one year. Plaintiff contended on appeal that the trial court improperly dismissed the appeal because &sect; 8-8(r) did not apply to actions taken during the time period at issue or, alternatively, that the statute was impermissible retroactive legislation abrogating substantive legal rights. The court agreed with plaintiff that &sect; 8-8(r) was inapplicable but that a different statutory provision, 1999 Conn. Spec. Acts 99-7(6)(c), applied to validate the amendment at issue. The court noted that several amendments have been made to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(r) and that the enactment of 1999 Conn. Spec. Acts 99-7(6)(c) was a proper exercise of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;53a-223b (Rev. to 2003). The court imposed a total sentence of one year and nine months incarceration. Defendant had already served his sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim had been in a dating relationship for approximately six months after which she obtained a restraining order against defendant. Defendant's conviction arose when he blocked the victim's car at a fast-food restaurant and tried to speak to her through her passenger side car window. The victim managed to maneuver her vehicle out and drove directly to the police station. Defendant followed and was arrested. On appeal, defendant claimed that his conviction under &sect; 53a-223b(a)(1) and (2) violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy and that the subdivisions were unconstitutionally vague. The court found no double jeopardy violation because &sect; 53a-223b(a)(1) and (2) required proof of an element that the other did not in that the term &quot;stay away&quot; in &sect; 53a-223b(a)(1) denoted physical proximity or spatial nearness and the term &quot;contact&quot; in &sect; 53a-223b(a)(2) meant not having any form of communication with the victim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendants, a city and a landowner, seeking damages for personal injuries, wrongful death, and other claims associated with an accident caused by a tree that fell on a car. The landowner filed a motion for summary judgment. The Superior Court, Judicial District of Waterbury (Connecticut), granted the landowner's motion, and plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tree was located on the landowner's property, approximately eight feet from a road. Ten years after cutting limbs off of the tree, the landowner informed the city that the tree was beginning to split. A representative of the city inspected the tree but did not have it removed. The tree later fell on a vehicle traveling on the road. The Connecticut Supreme Court had interpreted Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 23-59 and 23-65(b) as vesting exclusive control in a town tree warden over trees located in whole or in part in public roadways. The Supreme Court had held that owners of private, adjoining land were not liable to anyone accidentally injured by a tree falling in the roadway. Plaintiffs argued that this interpretation did not bar a claim for intentional damage to a tree that later caused personal injury. The appellate court held that the record did not support an assumption that the tree immediately threatened the life and limb of those who traveled on the road. The landowner's responsibility for denuding the tree was difficult to distinguish from what his liability would have been if the tree had been hit by lightning. Thus, the existing law absolved the landowner of liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father first claimed that the trial court improperly adopting verbatim significant portions of social studies in its written memorandum of decision. The appeals court's review of the record revealed that the DCF set forth sufficient, i.e., clear and convincing, evidence to support the court's factual findings regarding the termination of parental rights, despite the parroting of the social studies. The verbatim adoption of portions of the social studies did not dilute the DCF's burden of proof. Evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that a father failed to attain a degree of rehabilitation sufficient to warrant the belief that, at some time in the foreseeable future, he would be capable of assuming a responsible position with respect to his child's care, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-112(j)(3). Accordingly, the court's decision to terminate the father's parental rights was not clearly erroneous. The child suffered from the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome and exhibited numerous developmental disabilities. The father's progress, made over approximately two years, was insufficient when considered in relation to the child's special needs and her need for permanency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sued appellee state corrections department employees, in their official capacity, in the Superior Court, Judicial District of New Britain (Connecticut), for alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12101 et seq., and &sect; 504, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 794, of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The trial court dismissed the action. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that the state corrections department employees discriminated against him on the basis of his physical disability by refusing his request for placement in a single cell in the back of one of the housing facilities at the correctional institution in which he was housed. The inmate also contended that the trial court erred in dismissing his claim under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. On appeal, the court found that the inmate brought his action against the employees solely in their official capacities. Because suing the employees in their official capacities was tantamount to bringing the action against the State of Connecticut, the only immunity defense available to the employees was sovereign immunity. The trial court, therefore, improperly granted the motion to dismiss on the ground of statutory immunity. Further, by alleging that the employees' department received federal funding, the inmate alleged facts sufficient to defeat the defense of sovereign immunity as to his Rehabilitation Act claim. Finally, remand of the case was necessary for consideration of the inmate's claim under the Rehabilitation Act and for further consideration of the inmate's ADA claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford (Connecticut), convicted defendant of kidnapping in the second degree, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-94(a), attempt to commit kidnapping in the second degree, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-94(a) and 53a-49(a)(2), and risk of injury to a child, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(a)(1). He was sentenced to eight years in prison followed by 10 years of special parole. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant took the 12-year-old victim by the arm and attempted to pull her toward his parked vehicle. The appellate court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-94(a) failed to provide defendant fair notice that the brief encounter, in which he forcibly took the victim's arm but did not move her, was criminal misconduct. The evidence of the movement and confinement fell into the realm of the &quot;minuscule&quot; movement or duration of confinement. Thus, to hold that he was put on notice that the conduct would have violated the kidnapping statute was an absurd and unconscionable result. Further, the evidence did not establish that defendant was guilty of risk of injury to a child, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(a)(1), because the victim's statement that defendant pulled on her arm, alone, did not permit a rational trier of fact to conclude, without resorting to speculation and conjecture, that defendant's conduct was likely to jeopardize the victim's physical health. However, the evidence supported the conviction for attempted kidnapping. The trial court properly ruled that the noose found in defendant's car was admissible to establish his intent to kidnap the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed with respect to the conviction of kidnapping in the second degree and risk of injury to a child and the case was remanded with direction to render judgment of not guilty of those crimes. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of murder, that the trial court improperly declined to instruct the jury that the use of a deadly weapon, by itself, did not establish the intent to kill and that the trial court improperly instructed the jury as to the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

The jury had evidence that defendant was angry with the landlord for evicting him and that defendant had threatened two other tenants within hours of the landlord's stabbing death. The appellate court held the statements were highly indicative of defendant's state of mind at the time of the crime. Moreover, given the location and depth of the stab wounds, it was not unreasonable for the jury to infer that defendant intended to kill the landlord. The jury also had before it evidence that defendant attempted to conceal the murders. Several police officers testified that he spoke normally and showed no signs of intoxication. Thus, there was sufficient evidence for the jury reasonably to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had the specific intent to kill the landlord. Reviewing the trial court's instruction as a whole, it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by trial court's failure to include defendant's requested language.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that he should have had an evidentiary hearing to determine the true valuation, as he claimed that the property consisted of six lots worth over $ 2 million. An appraiser stated that there was one 19-acre lot worth $ 1.4 million. Affirming, the court, in its limited scope of review, ruled that the superior court did not abuse its discretion in accepting the valuation because the appraiser testified at the foreclosure hearing that while the owner bought the property years earlier as six lots with a higher value, circumstances concerning it had changed and that its highest and best use was as one lot. Noting that the owner did not file a motion for a second appraiser and an evidentiary hearing as Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-25 allowed, the court further ruled that because the owner could have made such a request but failed to do so, there was no Due Process Clause violation. Moreover, the owner did not file a motion to reopen the judgment within four months, as Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-212a required. In so ruling, the court took note of the superior court's equitable power to confirm the sale, which was properly exercised absent fraud, misrepresentation, surprise, or mistake.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed his victim in a dispute over the right to sell heroin on a particular street corner. The court affirmed his conviction. The trial court sufficiently investigated and dealt with allegations of jury misconduct. Individual voir dire ensured a fair and impartial jury even in light of potential contamination of the venire panel before such questioning and an investigation limited to a preliminary inquiry of counsel on the record was sufficient regarding an alleged premature discussion of the case after the jury was seated. Although a comment on the strength of defendant's case, made by the prosecutor during cross-examination of defendant's sister, was improper, it did not deny defendant of a fair trial as it was an isolated instance of misconduct and curative instructions were given. Questions asked of defendant regarding that witness were appropriate for uncovering potential bias. The prosecutor's closing argument was also appropriate. Finally, the trial court's instructions on consciousness of guilt and reasonable doubt were proper and the instructions did not improperly raise any mandatory presumptions that improperly relieved the State of its burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the trial court properly granted relief to the prisoner. The trial court relied on a doctor's report and the results of an earlier MRI, which indicated that the prisoner had a herniated disc in his back, and that the condition was degenerative. The appellate court held that this was sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the prisoner suffered from a serious medical condition. The appellate court further held that the trial court properly determined that the agency was deliberately indifferent to the prisoner's condition. The trial court made ample findings concerning the fact that the treatment afforded to the prisoner had not alleviated his condition, and the agency's repeated refusal to provide the prisoner with the evaluative services of a neurologist or a neurosurgeon. Thus, the trial court properly found that the prisoner's rights under the Eighth Amendment were violated.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant's admission that he was married to the victim's mother, together with testimony from a witness who was present at the marriage celebration, sufficiently established that relationship. However, testimony from the victim was insufficient to establish that the victim was the daughter of defendant's wife. The court reviewed the unpreserved constitutional challenge and held that defendant's equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV were violated by the prohibition of heterosexual, rather than homosexual, intercourse between kindred persons in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-72a(a)(2). It was noted that homosexual relationships were beyond the purview of the degrees of kindred for marriage purposes in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-21.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. The court also agreed with defendants that the trial court should have applied the standard for summary judgment. The court held that a motion for summary judgment could and should be used to address claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in certain circumstances, particularly, as in the case at bar, when a motion to dismiss had been denied but additional discovery could provide further evidence on which to decide the claim. The policy behind sovereign immunity was better effectuated by a thorough review of the materials before the court than by the more limited review associated with the motion to dismiss.

As such, his conduct was not entitled to First Amendment protection. Further, his parole was revoked because he engaged in a pattern of behavior that encompassed a series of statements and actions that a reasonable person would find to be a &quot;true threat,&quot; and, a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would be on fair notice that the threatening conduct the inmate exhibited violated the condition that his release not be &quot;incompatible with the welfare of society.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Defendant then pled guilty to having committed the crimes while on bond. After the instant court reversed an order denying his motion to correct an illegal sentence, and the trial court denied a second motion for correction, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the trial court improperly rejected his claims that the 10-year sentence enhancement imposed against him was illegal, as it was based on uncounseled earlier charges. The appeals court declined to review most of defendant's claims, as they challenged neither the legality of his sentence nor the legality of the manner in which the court imposed his sentence. If defendant believed that the court had overlooked his claim that the sentence was based on uncounseled earlier charges, then he could have filed a motion for articulation pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. App. P. &sect; 66-5. But, he failed to do so. Third, that the court did not obtain information about the alleged &quot;earlier charges&quot; from the presentence investigation report was irrelevant. Fourth, although defendant was afforded the right to be addressed personally at sentencing and to speak in mitigation of his punishment, he waived these rights by his voluntary failure to appear at his sentencing hearing. Finally, nothing in the record suggested vindictiveness by the judge at the sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the court violated his due process rights by (1) concluding that a Maadi MISR firearm was a prohibited assault weapon under Conn.

The relevant text of &sect; 53-202a indicated that all selective-fire firearms and certain specified semiautomatic firearms were &quot;assault weapons&quot; banned by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-202c. Second, testimony from a sergeant with the state police, who had been assigned to the special licensing and firearms unit for nearly five years, testified via a tripartite test that the Maadi MISR firearm used by defendant was comparable to an &quot;Avtomat Kalashnikov AK-47 type,&quot; which was one of the listed semiautomatic firearms prohibited under &sect; 53-202c. Second, defendant's due process argument was rejected, as he failed to show that the statute did not provide fair warning that it applied to the conduct at issue. He even considered the weapon he possessed to be an AK-47. Hence, his argument that he could not know that the Maadi MISR was a prohibited &quot;Avtomat Kalashnikov AK-47 type&quot; assault weapon was rejected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction for possession of an assault weapon was affirmed. But, by failing to brief the issues relating to the threatening conviction, his appeal from that conviction was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court found substantial evidence supported the arbitrators' factual findings regarding the officer's sexual misconduct, inappropriate behavior towards the women, misuse of his authority to influence the women, and lying to investigators. The officer's actions violated clearly defined public policies, reflected in state criminal statutes against stalking, disorderly behavior, and sexual assault. Also, sexual assault by the officer exposed the city to civil rights liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue in the instant action was the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(c), pursuant to which a court could order a person who has been acquitted of a crime because of mental disease or defect to be recommitted to the psychiatric security review board for continued hospitalization. Defendant claimed that his constitutional rights were violated when the statute was applied to him, as no history of his mental status had been documented like that of the defendant in State v. Long. But, this argument presupposed that defendant was foreclosed from initiating judicial review of the validity of his commitment. That was not the case. Defendant did not claim that he had a constitutional right to express notice of his right to apply directly to the court for his discharge. The court thus concluded that &sect; 17a-593(c) did not violate defendant's equal protection rights under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 or the Fourteenth Amendment, nor did not violate his due process rights under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute was constitutional, and the three questions were answered in the negative.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593, denied the acquittee's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and dismissed the petition on constitutional grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acquittee was on conditional release from a commitment in an assault when he killed someone. Once again found guilty by reason of insanity, he was committed for 25 years, the presumptive prison term for that type of murder. As the 25-year mark approached, the State sought to extend his term pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593, but mistakenly referenced the assault prosecution's docket number in its petition. The court held, first, that this type of error was circumstantial rather than substantive, since the acquittee certainly understood which case was being referenced, so that the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction was not implicated by the error, which could be corrected under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-123. Furthermore, according to the decision of Connecticut's highest court in State v. Long, made final while the instant appeal was pending, the trial court's determination that the extension of a commitment term violated due process and equal protection guarantees was an error, so that consideration of the petition could proceed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was granted leave to appeal from a decision of the Superior Court, Judicial District of Tolland (Connecticut), which dismissed the inmate's petition for writ of habeas corpus against respondents, the Connecticut Commissioner of Corrections and the state board of parole. The inmate had sought an order directing the board to declare him eligible for parole after he served 50 percent of his underlying sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his petition, the inmate asserted that under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-125a, he should be eligible for parole after serving 50 percent of his sentence for gun, narcotics, and forgery convictions. On appeal, the inmate argued that the trial court improperly dismissed his petition after finding that jurisdiction was lacking because the inmate had no liberty interest in or right to parole release and, therefore, there was no illegal confinement or an ex post facto unconstitutional application of a statute, such as &sect; 54-125a. The court reversed on the jurisdictional issue. Read together, &sect; 54-125a(a) and (b) clearly vested a liberty interest in parole eligible status to all persons described within &sect;&nbsp;54-125a(a), subject to the exclusion for the enumerated offenses and the 85 percent limitation embodied in &sect;&nbsp;54-125a(b).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife appealed certain orders in a dissolution judgment that gave the husband sole authority over whether the children could travel internationally, that denied her request to relocate to another state, that did not enter orders on the children's college expenses, and that did not require the husband to pay the wife's attorney's fees. The court found that the international travel orders did not restrict the wife's ability to travel or to exercise her religion. The reasonableness of restricting her ability to unilaterally travel with the children internationally was supported by the record, which showed that travelling to Israel was not in the children's best interests. Moreover, the guardian ad litem opposed relocation to Israel or another state since that would severely restrict the husband's parenting time with the children, who bonded with both parents and who needed regular contact from both parents. The children were very young, so retaining jurisdiction under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-56c for a later decision on college expenses was proper. Finally, the wife received ample resources in property division to deny her request for attorney's fees under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-62.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, and it affirmed all the challenged orders in favor of the husband.</SPAN></P>

The evidence defendant sought to introduce was a hospital record indicating that alcohol was in defendant's blood at a certain level on the day of the murder, but defendant did not explain what the level meant or show that he was drinking prior to the time of the murder. The trial court could have reasonably concluded that the foundation defendant laid for admission of the evidence was insufficient to support his claim of intoxication and, therefore, the evidence was too speculative to be relevant. Although the trial court improperly instructed the jury that false statements &quot;are,&quot; rather than &quot;may be,&quot; circumstantial evidence of guilty consciousness, the instructions as a whole did not mislead the jury, as the next instruction used permissive language on the same subject. Finally, the language used to explain reasonable doubt was previously upheld in cases that were binding precedential authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Connecticut transferred to the instant court an appeal by defendant from a judgment on jury verdict of the Connecticut Superior Court, Judicial District of Hartford, convicting him on two counts each of sexual assault and kidnapping. He challenged various rulings on evidence and argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-92 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, in his supermarket management position, hired the victim, a young girl with mental disabilities, as a bagger. During two periods of employment, he told her to accompany him to isolated areas of the building where he prevailed upon her to perform sex acts to which she lacked the capacity to consent. At his trial, another former employee with similar disabilities described similar experiences. The court held that these prior bad acts were admissible, since the trial court had provided a proper limiting instruction, and they could be considered with regard to consent issues and a possible pattern of conduct. Defendant failed to preserve certain due process claims, and they did not qualify for Golding review. Defendant's pre-Miranda statements were admissible, because his presence at the police station was completely voluntary when he made them. Finally, even though kidnapping did not merge with sexual assault charges under Connecticut law, the kidnapping statute was impermissibly vague as applied to one of defendant's sexual assaults, because there was not even a miniscule act of asportation or restraint of the victim's movement so as to justify the additional charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed one of defendant's kidnapping convictions and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to render judgment of not guilty as to that count.

The father claimed, inter alia, that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the aunt's motion to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties shared joint custody of the child with an evenly divided parenting arrangement. There were frequent contentious disputes with respect to educational placement, tuition, and child support. A guardian ad litem was appointed for the child. The father sought sole custody of the child. Following an emergency request by the guardian ad litem, the trial court determined that the child could elect the extent and the circumstances of her visitation with the father. The appellate court held that while the father enjoyed the rights of a parent recognized in Roth, the jurisdictional pleading requirements and heightened burden of persuasion of Roth were inapposite to the contested custody case. The father offered no support for his assertion that the specific requirements of Roth applied to a Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-57 third party motion to intervene. There was ample evidence to conclude that the presumption in the father's favor was rebutted. Also, the father had notice of the potential placement of the child with a relative. However, he was not given an opportunity to respond or to present any evidence on his view of the most efficient allocation of the tax exemption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a post-decree proceeding, plaintiff father filed a motion to reduce his child support paid to defendant mother. The Superior Court, Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk (Connecticut), granted the motion and set the father's total child support at $ 80 per week. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 46b-215a-2a(e) was unconstitutional. However, the appellate court found that the claim was not preserved for appellate review as the father failed to make the claim to the trial court. In his brief, the father did not seek review under either of the doctrines recognized to review unpreserved claims of error, and it was inappropriate to engage in a level of review that was not requested. The father also claimed that the trial court improperly relied on representations of the mother's counsel, in lieu of evidence, as the basis for its finding as to the child care costs. The appellate court agreed. The mother's financial affidavit did not list any cost for child care. During the hearing, the trial court solicited from the mother's counsel information regarding the cost of the child care, and counsel represented that the cost was $ 180 per month. The mother did not testify regarding the child care costs and did not provide any documentary evidence regarding that cost. Absent evidence, the trial court was without any basis to support its finding of the child care expenses, and its finding regarding those costs was clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed only as to the order regarding child care costs, and the case was remanded for further proceedings to determine the child care costs, if any, that the mother could recover from the father. The judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

Information, in the first case, charging the defendant with violation of probation and substitute information, in the second case, charging the defendant with two counts each of the crimes of risk of injury to a child and sexual assault in the first degree, brought to the Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford, where the second case was tried to the jury before Lavine, J.; verdict of guilty; thereafter, the first case was tried to the court; judgment of guilty; subsequently, the court denied the defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal in the second case and rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict, and the defendant appealed to this court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant digitally penetrated his eight-year-old daughter twice. The appellate court held a jury could find the insertions were distinct, so he was guilty of two counts each of risk of injury to a child and first degree sexual assault. He was not put in jeopardy twice for the same crime. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(a)(2), prohibiting risk of injury to a child, and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(a)(2), prohibiting first degree sexual assault, were clear to persons of common intelligence and not unconstitutionally vague. His offer to take a polygraph was properly excluded given its slight probative value, risk of prejudice to him from accompanying explanatory testimony, and potential for jury confusion. Prosecutorial comments about constancy of accusation witnesses explained such testimony's nature and did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, nor did references to the victim's credibility, in the entire trial's context. References to defense counsel's argument did not impugn counsel's integrity or institutional role. A sentence based on finding the victim was under 10, which was not submitted to the jury, was harmless error, given overwhelming evidence of the victim's age.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his convictions by the Superior Court, Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk (Connecticut), for assault in the third degree and breach of the peace. Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal, denied his request for a continuance, instructed the jury on the requirements of self-defense, and remanded defendant into custody pending sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim told defendant to stop choking a friend and a fight ensued. Several witnesses testified that defendant &quot;danced&quot; around the victim with his fists raised. The verdict allowed the appellate court to assume that the jury found that defendant hit the victim first. The jury reasonably could have inferred that defendant intended to harm the victim and, in fact, did harm him during a fight at a public park. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request for a continuance. Although the trial court's remarks about an alleged prior conviction were improper, defendant implicitly waived that claim as he agreed with the curative instruction. While the trial court's instruction on self-defense was improper, it was harmless. Defendant had to be resentenced as the Connecticut Supreme Court had determined that the 2000 amendment to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-63f was unconstitutional and as the appellate court could not predict whether the determination, which it concluded was retroactive, might have impacted defendant's sentence to two years of probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The transporters' business was intrastate shipment of hazardous waste products. In 1991, Conn. Gen.

Meanwhile, the transporters operated without a permit. In 1998, the department ordered the transporters to stop shipping without a permit. The transporters complied. But, when their permit application was denied, they sought money damages and declaratory relief under various constitutional theories. The action was dismissed on subject matter jurisdiction grounds due to sovereign and qualified immunity. The transporters appealed. The court found that it was undisputed that no permission was granted under Conn. Gen. Stat. ch. 53, &sect;&sect; 4-141 to 4-165 for money damage claims, so those claims were properly dismissed. Moreover, the transporters failed to show they had a right either to the permit or to conduct their business. Constitutional protection was not triggered to defeat sovereign immunity. The employee's conduct was authorized by statute, so it was not reckless under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 to trigger individual liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the transporters' action. It also affirmed denial of the motion for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Britain (Connecticut) of possession of narcotics with intent to sell by a person not drug-dependent (Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence of 350 packets of heroin found in his automobile in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The appeals court disagreed. The police had probable cause to believe that heroin would be found in the automobile based on the reliability of an informant and police surveillance that corroborated key details about the narcotics delivery. The trial court properly permitted the State to introduce evidence of prior misconduct as the evidence of defendant's prior criminal activity tended to make it more probable that he had knowledge of the heroin in the automobile and that he intended to deliver the heroin to the informant. Prior consistent statements by the informant were properly admitted as it was reasonable for the court to conclude that defendant attempted to impeach the informant on the ground of recent contrivance. Finally, the prosecutor's use of the term &quot;smoke and mirrors,&quot; although improper, was neither strongly critical nor severely condemnatory of defendant's attorney. Therefore, it was not so egregious as to implicate defendant's due process right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on various charges after he shot and killed two men. He appealed, claiming that the trial court improperly: (1) instructed the jury on intent for murder, (2) sanctioned a non-unanimous verdict, (3) consolidated murder and drug charges, (4) denied his motion to suppress pretrial identifications, (5) admitted autopsy photographs, and (6) instructed the jury on reasonable doubt. The court found that defendant did not preserve his challenge to the intent instruction and, regardless, the evidence overwhelmingly showed defendant's specific intent to kill. Unanimity was required by the jury charge. Consolidation of charges was proper since evidence on the drug charges went to motive for the murders and did not impair the jury's ability to decide the charges fairly. An eyewitness to the murders identified defendant independently of any state action and a subsequent identification that was arranged by police, while suggestive, was necessary for investigation of the crimes and apprehension of defendant. Gruesome autopsy photos were relevant to crucial issues and limiting instructions were given. Finally, similar reasonable doubt charges were approved in other cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), which denied the inmate's habeas corpus petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first ruled that the certification issue was moot because the habeas court had in fact granted certification based on a renewed request by the inmate for certification. The inmate's ineffective assistance argument was based on a claim of actual conflict in that the public defender's office that had represented him in his underlying murder trial had also represented three other people who were potential alternate suspects in the murder. He argued that the office failed to adequately investigate the three people and that the conflict prevented his public defender from presenting the plausible alternative defense theory of third party culpability. The court affirmed the habeas court's ruling that no actual conflict existed and that the inmate received effective assistance of counsel. The office did not represent one of the people, so there was no conflict there. As to the other two people, all that was proven by the evidence was that a potential conflict existed. The conflict never matured into an actual conflict. The failure to present the alternative defense was not a lapse in representation because the evidence supporting it was weak and was contrary to other evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued on appeal that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress the physical evidence seized from him and the statements he made to the police on the basis that the initial stop of his vehicle was not supported by a reasonable and articulable suspicion and that, even if the stop was justified, it was more intrusive than necessary. The court disagreed and found that defendant's vehicle matched the vehicle description that had been broadcast. The court found no merit in defendant's argument that his car was red versus maroon. The court further determined that the stop did not become more intrusive than necessary, because the arriving officers were advised to proceed with extreme caution as numerous weapons were reportedly involved in the initial incident, and the officers were entitled to ensure their safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence permitted a finding that defendant assaulted and injured a correctional officer who was performing his duties. The trial court gave a lengthy instruction to the jury on the subject of reasonable doubt and, in the course of it, instructed the jury that if it could reconcile all of the facts proved with any reasonable theory consistent with the innocence of defendant, then it could not find him guilty. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, he argued that the language of the trial court unconstitutionally suggested that it was for the jury to evaluate the evidence in an attempt to prove a theory of innocence rather than deciding whether the State carried its burden of proof. In affirming the judgment, the court noted that defendant did not preserve his constitutional claim. The court found that because the challenged part of the charge had been approved on several occasions and the trial court's instructions on reasonable doubt, considered in their entirety, were not improper, defendant had failed to establish that a constitutional violation clearly existed and deprived him of a fair trial, and thus, defendant could not prevail on his claim of constitutional error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants placed a lien on half of the inmate's inherited funds, as authorized by &sect; 18-85b and Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect;18-85a-2. Plaintiffs' initial complaint alleged that this violated their rights (1) to procedural due process, (2) under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, (3) to substantive due process, and (4) under the Equal Protection Clause. They did not appeal the trial court's order striking that complaint but filed a substituted complaint with the same allegations, plus a new allegation transforming their previous, generic equal protection claim into a colorable claim of selective enforcement. Therefore, the appellate court held that they could appeal only the trial court's striking of the new equal protection claim. Plaintiffs alleged that the State unfairly targeted the inmate to the exclusion of similarly-situated inmates and that defendants lacked a rational basis for this differential treatment. Because plaintiffs failed to allege specific instances of discrimination among the members of the class of eligible inmates, the trial court properly struck plaintiffs' equal protection claim for failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife obtained a judgment against the husband in Nevada for non-payment of alimony. She domesticated the judgment under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-605. The husband began a partition action on jointly held Connecticut property. After a decision dividing the proceeds between the parties was reversed, the superior court held that the wife's judgment entitled her to all the partition proceeds. The husband appealed. The parties agreed that affirming that decision would render the wife's separate appeal of an interpleader action moot. The husband argued that the wife's judgment became unenforceable when a Nevada court subsequently modified it, that the wife did not file a judgment lien on the property, and that he had no opportunity to be heard on his defenses. The court found that the modification did not require further domestication and, due to the timing of the proceedings, it was not feasible for the wife to obtain a judgment lien prior to partition. Finally, the order to pay the wife the partition proceeds did not infringe on the clerk's sovereign immunity and the husband's substantive defenses to the wife's judgment had to be tried in Nevada and not Connecticut.</SPAN></P>

He sought reinstatement and back pay. The department moved to dismiss on the basis of sovereign immunity and failure to exhaust remedies. The superior court granted dismissal of the monetary claims, but it denied dismissal of the reinstatement claim, holding that the relief sought was injunctive and sovereign immunity did not bar such claims. The department appealed. The court found that the allegations that an employee with less seniority was not laid off, if proven true, would sufficiently establish that the department acted in excess of its authority under &sect; 5-241 and sovereign immunity was inapplicable to claims for injunctive relief based on actions in excess of the department's authority.

A reasonable person was on notice that the lawn at the park was ornamental and that digging holes in the lawn was prohibited. The mere fact that the town permitted members of the public to use the lawn for certain activities did not take away from its ornamental value. The evidence supported the conviction. There was testimony that defendant dug holes in the park's lawn and that the digging damaged the lawn and killed the grass. The damage created by the digging did not repair itself. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding photographs of the lawn as they were not taken on the date the citation was issued and were not relevant to whether the lawn was ornamental.

When the landowner finally requested that a planned development district be created out of its several parcels, the neighbors challenged the aldermen's authority for granting approval. In the absence of any statutory references to such districts, the appellate court examined the powers conferred generally on municipalities by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2, as amended by 1959 Conn.

Two years later, the town's attorney advised it that the commission was not authorized to require contributions to the sidewalk fund, and the landowner sought a refund. The refund was refused, and the landowner brought the underlying suit. The motion to dismiss was filed on the ground that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in that the landowner had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to challenging the sidewalk fund payment within the statutory time period and that the constitutional challenge count lacked ripeness. The court upheld the dismissal of the landowner's counts with regard to obtaining a refund as he had failed to challenge the payment and was precluded from collaterally attacking the same via the initiation of his cause of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned and operated a 12-screen multiplex theater. The taxpayer's property contained 27 acres. The taxpayer challenged an assessment by the town. The taxpayer challenged only the valuation of its building, not the land and site improvements. After considering the valuation of the property as a whole, the trial court found the total fair market value of the property to be less than the valuation, thereby sustaining the taxpayer's appeal. On appeal, the taxpayer contended that because it challenged only one portion of the assessment in its pleadings, the trial court was permitted to determine the value of that portion only. However, the court held that the taxpayer could not limit the parameters of a valuation determination by challenging in its pleadings only one portion of the assessment. The court further held that the colloquy between the trial court and the counsel for the town indicated that there was no clear, deliberate, and unequivocal concession that only the value of the building was at issue. Finally, the court could not say that the taxpayer was denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard on the issue of the valuation of the land and site improvements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police pursued defendant often at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour. Two officers attempted to box in defendant's vehicle. After the first officer passed defendant's vehicle with his cruiser, he positioned his cruiser in front of defendant's vehicle and slowed. The second officer drove his cruiser alongside defendant's vehicle, but he swerved his vehicle into the officer's travel lane. That officer avoided a collision but lost control of his cruiser, which spun counterclockwise off the highway and collided with trees on the median strip. The officer was killed. It was reasonable for the jury to conclude that the accident was within the scope of the risk defendant created by leading the police on a high-speed pursuit. Further, a reasonable person could foresee that during a high speed chase, a police officer, another motorist on the highway, an innocent bystander or defendant himself could be injured. Finally, a mechanical failure of any type was within the scope of the risk created by defendant's criminal behavior of leading the police in pursuit. The court's instruction to the jury, therefore, was not a clear violation of the defendant's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

That was sufficient to give defendant notice that the State could have sought a conviction on the ground of accessorial liability. The State charged defendant with the single offense of conspiracy, committed conjunctively in one of 14 different ways. This was not a case in which the trial court improperly instructed the jury on a theory of liability that was not included in the information. The charge was correct and, therefore, it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled. Specifically, the trial court thoroughly discussed the elements contained in each of the 14 substantive underlying offenses, explained that the conspiracy count was a separate charge, and instructed the jury that to arrive at a guilty verdict, it had to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant intended that conduct constituting any one or more of the crimes set forth in count one through 14 of the information was performed.</SPAN></P>

So long as he intended to harm someone by shooting, it made no difference that he was not trying to hurt the particular victim. This rule had been adequately explained to the jury. The information adequately alleged all the charged offenses, and the evidence was sufficient to permit a rational jury to have found defendant guilty.

She argued that the evidence was insufficient to show that she induced or attempted to induce a witness to absent herself from that proceeding. However, the jury reasonably could have interpreted defendant's request that the victim in the underlying criminal process drop the case from her brother and to excuse the case or cut the case. Viewed in light of defendant's expressed concerns with her brother's situation and her desire to help him, as a request that the victim absent herself from the proceeding, such instructions comported with the interpretation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-151. Further, the evidence of the sexual assault charges against defendant's brother clearly was relevant to the issue of motive, to whether there was an official proceeding, and to the existence of defendant's common plan or scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant testified that she ended the relationship because defendant was very possessive of her and did not permit her do as she pleased. She testified that defendant did not accept that the relationship was over. On appeal, defendant first claimed that the court improperly excluded evidence of the sexual nature of the relationship between the complainant and himself. When defendant's counsel inquired concerning whether the complainant's mother knew that the complainant and defendant had engaged in a sexual relationship, the prosecutor objected, and the court sustained the objection. The court improperly excluded relevant evidence as to the intimate relationship between the complainant and defendant. Thus, the court's attempt to protect the complainant's reputation precluded him from confronting his accuser. Defendant's right to confront the complainant encompassed his right to cross-examine her vigorously for purposes of his defense. In light of the fact that the relationship between the complainant and defendant lay at the heart of the case the excluded evidence was most relevant, and the court abused its discretion in excluding it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in an altercation between various people outside a bar. At some point, defendant stabbed the victim. Defendant claimed self-defense and accident. The State acknowledged some error in the instructions as to general intent. However, the State claimed the pertinent instructions, as a whole, properly apprised the jury that the element of intent could be satisfied only by a finding of intent to cause the specific result of serious physical injury. Defendant claimed that because he raised self-defense, his intent to cause serious physical injury (a specific result), rather than the intent to use a knife (specific conduct), was crucial, and that the charge, viewed as a whole, deprived him of the due process right to a fair trial by unconstitutionally reducing the State's burden of proof. The appellate court agreed with defendant. On the basis of the conflicting testimony by the friends of the victim and the friends of defendant, as well as that of the victim and defendant, the charge on intent to cause serious physical injury was key to the issue of defendant's guilt. Thus, the verdict could not stand in the face of the evidence and the charge to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded that defense counsel could not properly comment on defendant's lack of a felony record when no evidence was admitted regarding the record's existence or nonexistence. The statements to the jury about defendant's lack of a felony record resulted in defense counsel improperly vouching for defendant's credibility. Thus, the trial court properly interrupted defense counsel's improper argument and properly gave a curative instruction. However, the combination of the trial court's incorrect final curative instructions charging that defendant had no constitutional right not to testify and the trial court's use of the term &quot;unreasonable,&quot; rather than &quot;unfavorable,&quot; rose to the level of a constitutional violation because it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled.</SPAN></P>

The evidence presented allowed the trial court to find that defendant had the requisite intent to be guilty of disorderly conduct. In the course of the protest, defendant chased one car as it entered the parking lot and, as the car began to turn, his actions and proximity to the car nearly caused the car to collide with him. That greatly upset the driver. The court further found no merit to defendant's contention that the State failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was delivered prematurely with premature lungs.

The parents alleged that both the obstetrician, who delivered the child, and the neonatologist, an employee of the hospital, were negligent in several ways and that as a consequence, the child suffered from serious infirmities, including brain damage and cerebral palsy. The appellate court held that since the parents presented some evidence from which a jury could conclude that the neonatologist was aware that the child was at risk for subsequent brain injuries and failed to warn the parents of that risk, there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the repose section of &sect; 52-584 was tolled. However, the obstetrician did not have a duty to warn the parents of the known health risks flowing from a diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome, as upon delivery, the child's care was entrusted to the hospital and the neonatologist. The parents failed to demonstrate the obstetrician fraudulently concealed the cause of action from them. Finally, there was a rational basis for Connecticut's three-year statute of repose embodied in &sect; 52-584.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured worker appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Britain (Connecticut) which dismissed the worker's appeal from a declaratory ruling by defendant Connecticut State Employees Retirement Commission which denied the worker's application for service-connected disability retirement benefits. The trial court held the Commission had no jurisdiction to review the state medical examining board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker obtained workers' compensation benefits for his work site injury. He then filed an application for disability retirement benefits under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-169. The medical board found the worker had not shown that his injury was service connected pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-192p. The appellate court held that it was indisputable that applicability of the doctrine of collateral estoppel raised difficult issues on which medical training and practice shed no light. As far as the record showed, the medical board did not seek legal advice to assist it in its deliberations. The Commission had jurisdiction to decide whether the medical board had exclusive authority to decide the worker's eligibility. The worker had not established his alleged right to a disability retirement pension. Pursuant to &sect; 5-192p(f), the medical board had exclusive authority to decide whether his injury was service connected. As a matter of law, the medical board was not precluded from deciding the issue of service connection because that issue had not actually been litigated in prior workers' compensation proceedings. The worker was not deprived of his right to procedural due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission's declaratory ruling properly denied the worker's application for a disability retirement pension. The trial court properly dismissed the administrative appeal, albeit, on incorrect grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two different robberies were committed. Defendant and an acquaintance were arrested on unrelated narcotics charges. The acquaintance testified that defendant told him that he had committed a robbery. A bank employee at the second robbery identified defendant as the robber when shown a photographic array. She also made an in-court identification. The police found a green camouflage hat with an elastic chin strap from the truck of the acquaintance's girlfriend that matched a hat depicted in a black and white photograph made from the second bank's surveillance videotape at the time of the robbery. The appellate court held that after a visual review of the photographic array, it determined the array was not impermissibly suggestive although defendant's picture was darker. The difference in color composition, alone, did not render the array unnecessarily suggestive. Thus, the motion to suppress was properly denied. There was not sufficient evidence as to the first robbery as there were no witnesses who could identify defendant. But, there was sufficient evidence to prove defendant was the perpetrator of the second robbery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment in the first robbery was affirmed. The judgment as to the second robbery was reversed. The second case was remanded with direction to render a judgment of not guilty.</SPAN></P>

The Commission and the trial court dismissed the resident's appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed. The requested documents were protected by the attorney-client privilege. Because there was no pending litigation or claim involved, implied waiver of the privilege was inapplicable. Voluntarily disclosure of the letter did not create an express waiver of the privilege.

The court found precedential decisions regarding enforcement of &sect; 31-71b and related statutes under the same section showed that strict liability attached to the crime.

Stat. &sect; 21a- 252(a) was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness, and (3) allowed an expert to testify as to an ultimate issue in the case. The court found the trial court did not improperly admit into evidence the 13 boxes of pads of prescription forms because that was not the type of evidence that was likely to excite the passions of the jury or implicate criminal propensity. Moreover, since defendant was a physician, his obviously legitimate reasons for having the forms minimized any prejudice that could possibly result. The court next found that defendant's argument for why Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-252(a) was unconstitutionally vague would distort the intent of the legislature and would lead to an illogical result. Finally, the expert's testimony regarding prescription practices and procedures, which was elicited through the use of hypothetical questions, was necessary to educate the jury and was not impermissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The member brought an action for a judgment declaring that he was entitled to membership in the tribe, and for other damages resulting from denial of his membership. The superior court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and because the tribe enjoyed sovereign immunity from any other claims. The member appealed. The court found that the member failed to follow the procedures set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47-66j(b), which provided that membership disputes were to be settled by a tribal council and that the council's decision would be final on substantive issues. The statute also provided an appeal to the superior court on procedural issues, but it granted primary jurisdiction of tribal membership disputes to a tribal council. Since the tribal council had primary jurisdiction and since the member did not pursue that avenue of relief, the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and the action was properly dismissed. To the extent that any remaining claims could be construed as against the tribe, those claims were properly dismissed based on tribal immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions by the Superior Court, Judicial District of Fairfield (Connecticut), for possession of marijuana with intent to sell by a person who was not drug-dependent and conspiracy to sell marijuana by a person who was not drug-dependent. Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress statements he made to the police and gave improper jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police found $ 10,340 in United States currency and $ 20,000 in Jamaican currency, two loaded handguns, and 15 pounds of marijuana in defendant's residence. Defendant was placed under arrest and read his Miranda rights from a printed warning card. He subsequently signed and initialed a Miranda waiver form and answered questions regarding his involvement in drug activity. With respect to the oral advisement of rights upon defendant's arrest, the record did not reveal what specific rights the officer included or omitted. Thus, the appellate court did not have enough facts to judge whether the police failed to inform defendant adequately of his rights. The different factual scenarios invoked by the State concerned only one element of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b), namely, knowing possession of marijuana with the intent to sell. Accordingly, a specific unanimity instruction was not required. The trial court gave an adequate charge on the elements of conspiracy. None of the challenged instructions, when considered in the broader context of the instructions as a whole, diluted the State's burden of proof or misled the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mortgage was given some property owners to the mortgage holder more than 20 years earlier. The evidence indicated the mortgage was satisfied. The possessor, the owner of the property at the time of litigation, and its immediate predecessors in title held an undisturbed possession of the property for more than six years. The mortgage holder failed to deliver a release, despite a demand. The attorney represented clients who purchased the former property owners' land. When those clients conveyed the land to the possessor, the unreleased mortgage to the mortgage holder was discovered, and the attorney signed an indemnity agreement with the title insurer in order to facilitate the sale to the possessor. Thus, the attorney was both statutorily and classically aggrieved. In the event that the mortgage was not declared invalid by the action brought under &sect; 49-13, the possessor would have been required to defend any foreclosure of the mortgage holder's mortgage that was brought against its grantees who had received warranty deeds from the possessor. Since the possession was undisturbed for more than six years, the possessor was also aggrieved, even though it was not the sole owner.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the use of circumstantial evidence. The trial court properly defined the intent elements of accessorial liability and instructed the jury that the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the crimes charged. Therefore, it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court's instruction on the use of circumstantial evidence to infer the intent elements of accessorial liability. The appellate court further held that because defendant had to have knowingly sold a hallucinogenic substance to violate Conn. Gen.

The Blockburger test was applied and required two conditions: that both crimes arise out of the same incident and be the same offense. Defendant's statement, as the predicate act for both crimes, satisfied the first condition. The appeals court's analysis concluded (1) that it could not determine that the legislature specifically intended to create two separate crimes and punishments for the same act, and (2) that breach of peace was not a lesser included offense of threatening, based on both crimes' statutory requirements, as a person could commit either crime without committing the other. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-183's intent to harass, annoy, or alarm could be accomplished without necessarily violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-62(a)(2)'s threatening to commit any crime of violence with the intent to terrorize another, and vice-versa. Section 53a-62(a)(2) was not facially vague.

The officer used street talk to explain to him that he needed crack cocaine. The man said it was being cooked. The officer said he would wait. The man entered a building, exited a minute later with defendant in his company, and walked towards the officer's car. Defendant stopped several feet short of the car. The man walked up to it. The man then handed the officer a quantity of crack cocaine. The officer paid for it, and then watched the man walk to defendant and hand the money to him. The trial court instructed the jury on accessory liability and conspiracy. Defendant was then found guilty of selling narcotics and conspiring to sell narcotics. On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal, as the trial court's instructions on conspiracy and accessorial liability did not mislead the jury, the evidence supported a finding that defendant acted as an accessory, defendant was not placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense, and the trial court properly instructed the jury on the elements of conspiracy to sell narcotics.</SPAN></P>

The city officials claimed that the action had been rendered moot because the contested practice had ceased and that the action should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the action was moot because the budgeting methods had changed. Although an exception to the mootness doctrine existed with regard to a claim that was capable of repetition, yet evading review, the court found that the exception did not apply. The taxpayer's claims were not of a nature to evade review because the budget process was not of a limited duration and did not present a functionally insurmountable time constraint. Moreover, the claim did not appear to be capable of repetition because there was no indication that the city officials planned to use the same budgeting method in the future.</SPAN></P>

The property owners received just compensation through the condemnation proceedings and chose not to challenge the value assigned to the property during those proceedings. They failed to challenge the valuation pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-132. If the property owners were unsatisfied with the compensation that they received, an appeal should have been taken during the compensation process. The property owners' inverse condemnation claim would serve only to relitigate the issues that were resolved in the eminent domain action. The fact that the property owners chose not to pursue their remedies pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8-129 to 8-133 was fatal to their claim. There could be no valid inverse condemnation claim when the property in question already had been taken by eminent domain.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed their appeal of a decision by defendant, the Inland Wetlands Commission of the Town of Oxford, which denied their application for a wetlands and watercourses permit in connection with the proposed construction of a residential home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs submitted an application to the Commission for permission to build a two bedroom residential home, a driveway, and a septic system. A portion of the proposed construction was for a driveway and piping for the septic system, which would cross 267 square feet of wetlands. The Commission denied the application, and the trial court affirmed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The record before the Commission contained substantial evidence to support its decision that activities on the non-wetlands portion of the land would likely impact or affect the wetlands, resulting in additional decline in its functional values. A site inspection report indicated the potential dangers of flooding resulting from fill on the lot, flooding onto neighboring property, and seasonal flooding. A report by a soil scientist stated that the household use of fertilizer, pesticides, and herbicides was a concern because the wet conditions encountered on the site for much of the year promoted the mobility of those items. The report also identified problems with the septic system leaching field in light of the unidirectional flow of perched groundwater on the property's level terrain.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's vagueness and overbreadth challenges as to application failed because the order was adequate to give him fair warning that leaving two expletive and posturing laden messages on the victim's answering machine constituted a violation of the order prohibiting him from harassing or threatening her.

After the parties had presented evidence, but before closing arguments and jury instructions by the court, the State filed its second substitute information, which amended count one. The appellate court held the State did not charge an additional or different offense by the omission of &quot;tumultuous&quot; behavior. Defendant could not demonstrate that a substantive right may have been prejudiced by the amended information. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the state to amend the information. Section 53a-181(a)(5) was not overbroad. It did not prohibit constitutionally protected speech. Therefore, there was no clear constitutional violation that deprived defendant of a fair trial and his claim failed to satisfy the third prong of Golding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The service sought an additional 61 livery permits. The department granted five new permits after it determined that five was the number of permits that would improve the public's convenience and necessity, the criteria set out in &sect; 13b-103(b). The service contended that the statute lacked the constitutionally required standards to guide the department in making determinations about livery permits and that the department improperly applied the standard set out in &sect; 13b-103(b) to the service's application. The trial court never reached the constitutional question. The court addressed both contentions and affirmed. The court held that (1) although the service was seeking a benefit under the statute, the court could still properly consider the constitutional issue; (2) the standard of &quot;public convenience and necessity&quot; set out in &sect; 13b-103(b) was constitutionally sufficient to provide the department with guidance in considering permit applications; (3) the trial court applied the proper standard in reviewing the service's appeal; and (4) the department reasonably interpreted &sect; 13b-103(b) to require an applicant to satisfy all of the factors enumerated therein for issuance of permits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Twenty-three lawsuits were filed against clergymen and the diocese, alleging sexual abuse of minors, all of which were withdrawn upon settlement prior to trial.

More than one year thereafter, the trial court granted the publishers' application for creation of a new file and also granted the motion to vacate sealing and protective orders entered in those lawsuits. The court held that the creation of a new file should not have been granted because the trial court no longer had continuing jurisdiction after the jurisdictional time limitation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-212a expired, and accordingly that and the subsequent orders regarding disclosure of the sealed and protected materials were erroneous. The court noted that the appeal from the order creating a new file was proper because it effectively restored the underlying cases to the docket. The court held that the trial court had no inherent authority over the files in its custody that would have permitted it to so act. There was no waiver of the limitation period, nor was the protective order akin to an injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was invited to dine with defendant and his wife. The victim was 52 years old, partially blind, and developmentally disabled. Defendant drove the victim home. After unsuccessfully attempting to coerce and then force the victim to have sex with him on the way home, defendant attacked and raped her at her home. After his conviction, the appellate court found that there was no evidentiary basis from which a reasonable fact finder could have determined that the victim had consented to defendant's behavior toward her on the evening in question, either by her words or actions. Further, there was no evidentiary basis on which the jury could have concluded that defendant could have misapprehended the victim's attitude toward his advances. Contrary to defendant's claims on appeal, the appellate court believed that the prosecutor's comments were not such that the jury would naturally and necessarily consider them to be comments on defendant's failure to testify. Instead, the comment could reasonably have been understood as an effort by the prosecutor to remind the jury of the evidence regarding the victim's intellectual and emotional limitations.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had previously granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of possession of narcotics, and after trial, denied the same relief with respect to the sale charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers who were watching the area of a motel where defendant was, based on information that there was drug activity, observed defendant making phone calls in a pattern that appeared to be drug-related. An undercover officer bought drugs from him and defendant was thereafter arrested and charged. The trial court granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal with respect to the possession charge, finding that he was legally in possession of a painkiller pursuant to a prescription. He was convicted on the sale charge. On appeal, the court held that defendant's claim that he was a &quot;drug-dependent person&quot; within Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b) because he was medically dependent on the painkiller did not show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was dependent on drugs at the time of the charged offense. Accordingly, the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal was proper. Additionally, it was noted that defendant's claim that the statutory definitions of drug dependence in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b) were unconstitutionally vague lacked merit because he failed to show that a constitutional violation clearly existed that clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the end of a trial held after the Supreme Court of Connecticut reversed defendant's first conviction on a charge of murder, a jury sitting in the Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut), returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of murder, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54a. The superior court denied defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal and entered judgment convicting defendant. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant testified at his first trial and told the jury that he had never &quot;put his hands on a female&quot; before he killed the victim. Defendant was convicted of murder after his first trial, but his conviction was reversed on appeal. In defendant's second trial, defendant elected not to testify, but during the State's case-in-chief, defendant's testimony from the first trial was read to the jury and a police officer testified that defendant told him he had &quot;never hit a woman before&quot; when he reported the incident. After that evidence was introduced, the prosecutor offered a page from defendant's medical records which showed that defendant admitted assaulting his niece. The appellate court held that (1) pursuant to Conn. Code Evid. R. 8-8, the fact that defendant did not testify at his second trial did not preclude the State from using defendant's medical records to impeach defendant's statement to the police officer and the statement he made when he testified at his first trial; and (2) the instructions on reasonable doubt which the trial court gave the jury were not flawed.</SPAN></P>

The teacher was found not guilty on the charges against him. On appeal, the teacher claimed that the trial court improperly granted defendants' motion for a directed verdict by concluding that there was insufficient evidence to establish that they had conspired to violate the teacher's rights. The appellate court concluded that the directed verdict was appropriate since the only evidence presented by the teacher went to ill will toward the teacher by the superintendent due to the teacher's critical appraisal of the superintendent's performance. Mere speculation based on the past ill will of one defendant was not sufficient to support the teacher's claim. The teacher also claimed the trial court erred in finding that that probable cause did exist to arrest the teacher. The appellate court held that the directed verdict on the false arrest and malicious prosecution claims were proper because the stories of seven students corroborated each other and the school nurse's report documented the students' physical injuries.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in instructing the jury about his flight from the scene and his statements after the shooting. The court held that while the trial court could have referenced defendant's explanations for his flight, it was not required to do so. Further, defendant's claim about the instructions regarding his statements was not preserved for review. Because neither claim raised a constitutional issue, the court reviewed the entire charge in determining that no injustice resulted from the instructions presented to the jury. In the court's view, defendant's complaint that the trial court improperly limited hearsay testimony was unpreserved, evidentiary in nature, and was not of constitutional magnitude. Finally, the trial court's failure to submit the issue of the applicability of &sect; 53-202k to the jury, and its imposition of an enhanced sentence under the statute, were harmless error.</SPAN></P>

Under those circumstances, the appellate court held that the evidence of defendant's specific intent to kill was so strong that there was no requirement to comply with defendant's request for an instruction on first-degree manslaughter. The general jury instruction regarding determination of witness credibility was perfectly adequate despite its failure to single out the key eyewitness by name. Jurors would not have had any trouble, at the end of a short trial, remembering that only two witnesses had testified to having felony convictions. Even if defendant had preserved his challenge to an instruction on flight as evidence of consciousness of guilt, such an instruction was not improper in Connecticut, and there was no abuse of discretion in giving it in defendant's case. Finally, certain restrictions on defendant's cross-examination of the key eyewitness regarding her drug use were the natural result of defendant's having failed to lay a foundation for such evidence.</SPAN></P>

It was for the jury to determine credibility issues, and the victim's initial failure to provide a description was explained by the fact that medical personnel did not allow police to interview him. The eyewitness identification evidence was properly admissible. Not only was the array not unduly suggestive, but even if it had been, the victim's in-court identification had an independent basis in that he had ample opportunity to observe defendant earlier on the evening of the shooting. Finally, the reference to prior felony convictions involving a firearm was more probative than it was prejudicial. Although the jury rather than the trial court should have found the facts underlying a sentence enhancement under Conn. Gen.

However, when she was still entitled to 15.72 more weeks of those benefits, she moved to Florida. The commissioner found that, because she moved to Florida, she did not meet the requirement of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-308a(a) that the benefits were only available to employees who were willing and able to perform work in Connecticut. On appeal, the worker claimed that the board: (1) improperly affirmed the determination that she was not entitled to the benefits, as she moved to Florida; and (2) improperly enforced the requirement that she be willing and able to perform work in Connecticut, as that requirement improperly restricted her right to interstate travel. The appellate court found that the language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-308a(a) was plain and unambiguous and required that a claimant be both willing and able to perform work in Connecticut. The board properly found that the worker was neither willing nor able to perform work in Connecticut. The right to travel did not encompass one's right to relocate to another state and yet avail oneself of the benefits to which one was entitled in one's former state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Waterbury Judicial District (Connecticut), convicting him on jury verdict of murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was an enormous amount of evidence that defendant committed a brutal murder, including statements, later recanted, by both defendant and a woman friend in whom he confided, but the two defense theories he sought to advance were that he was intoxicated at the time and that he was altogether innocent. The appellate court held that neither claim was based in the evidence, and innocence was not a theory of defense, so defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on either subject. Although the trial court should not have mentioned that it was not customary to tape interrogations in Connecticut, the reference to that information did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, nor did the trial court's articulation of reasonable doubt. Finally, none of defendant's Batson challenges, not even the one in which the trial court bent over backwards to be fair to defendant and refused to allow the State to peremptorily challenge the juror in question, had merit, as the State showed race-neutral reasons for its challenges in all three situations.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded the grandmother's allegations and the proof were insufficient to invoke the trial court's jurisdiction, and the evidence could not satisfy the high clear and convincing standard. Specifically, the appellate court determined the proof did not allow the appellate court to conclude that there was clear and convincing evidence the grandmother had a parent-like relationship with the child. In other words, the appellate court found an absence of the essential allegations and proof in support thereof, both of the nature of the relationship between the grandmother and the child as well as the harm that the child would suffer were visitation denied.</SPAN></P>

The court did not deprive defendant of his constitutional rights to testify on his behalf when it ruled that he had waived that right.

The evidence of one offense could have been admitted in a separate trial of the other offenses to prove a pattern of criminal conduct. Additionally, the trial court's instructions cured any possible prejudice. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding distracting, side issue, evidence of false complaints which had been admitted on a prior mistrial. Defendant failed to preserve or properly raise certain arguments. The prosecutor's closing arguments and comments were not improper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pled nolo contendere to risk of injury to a child, and the State agreed the maximum sentence of incarceration it would impose would be two years. Defendant was sentenced to eight years' incarceration, suspended after two years, and five years' probation. The Superior Court, Judicial District of New Britain (Connecticut), denied defendant's motion to vacate and to withdraw his plea. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly denied his post-sentence motions to vacate the judgements and to withdraw his pleas of nolo contendere because they were involuntary, unknowing, and unconstitutional. Specifically, defendant argued that the sentence he received violated the plea agreement and was illegal. The court of appeals held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's motion to withdraw his pleas. The court of appeals noted that, based on the record, it was clear that defendant understood the terms of his pleas, and there was nothing to indicate that they were not voluntarily entered. The court of appeals concluded that it was clear that defendant contemplated a period of probation when he entered into his plea agreement. As for the legality of the sentence, the court of appeals held that defendant's sentence violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-29(e), since it did not satisfy the statute's minimum sentence requirement. The court of appeals noted, however, that the statutory minimum was within the parameters of the plea agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed. The judgment was reversed only as to defendant's sentence. The case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that (1) although the acquittee did not raise his claim that Conn. Gen.

On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court improperly allowed identification from a photo array. The appellate court found that the photo lineup was not unnecessarily suggestive, and the array was within constitutional bounds. Admission of a statement made by the victim was relevant since it identified defendant, even though it implied that defendant was a gang member, and its admission did not substantially prejudice defendant due to the overwhelming evidence of guilt. Although defendant was not allowed to cross-examine a witness about a nolle, his cross-examination satisfied the constitutional standard. A trial court did not err in restricting cross-examination about nolles where the accused otherwise was able to cross-examine to show bias, motive, or prejudice. The standard of review for admission of a photograph was limited to whether the trial court clearly abused its discretion. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing admission of autopsy photos because they appeared to be relevant at the time they were offered. Finally, there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted &sect; 53-21 was unconstitutional, that the court improperly admitted pornographic videos, and his right to due process was violated when the trial court improperly failed to disclose exculpatory material after an in camera review.</SPAN></P>

The police subsequently seized among other items, 11 pornographic videotapes which had been shown to the minor victims. Defendant had also supplied alcohol to the victims. The appellate court held the statutory exception set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 30-86 was for the delivery of alcohol by a parent, guardian, or spouse of the minor. Defendant was not the equivalent of a guardian for purposes of &sect; 30-86. Thus, his serving alcohol to minors did not fall within the exception created by &sect; 30-86. The application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21 to defendant's conduct was constitutional because the statute was not vague. Defendant placed the victims in a situation where their physical health was at risk and their morals could be impaired. The application of the &sect; 53-21 to defendant did not implicate the constitutional right of a parent to raise a child. The pornographic videotapes were properly admitted. There was nothing exculpatory contained in the victim's records.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by (1) precluding the mother's testimony, as the mother had violated a sequestration order by being in the courtroom during another witness's testimony and could have unfairly shaped her own testimony; (2) limiting defense counsel's closing argument as to the effect of defendant's age, as no evidence was presented to the jury from which to infer that the 17-year-old defendant lacked the ability to recognize the intent of others; and (3) limiting the cross-examination of the State's witness, as the prohibited questions were irrelevant to the witness's credibility or defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 17A-100. She challenged the removal, and the removal was upheld. The foster parent appealed. Defendant commissioner of children and families filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Britain (Connecticut) entered judgment, granting the motion. The foster parent appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner argued that the administrative proceeding was not a &quot;contested case,&quot; within the meaning of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-166 et seq., because the foster parent did not have a statutory right to a hearing. The parent argued that as a foster parent, she had a liberty interest in family life matters. In deciding against the foster parent, the appellate court found the parent lacked standing, because she failed to establish either classical or statutory aggrievement. Therefore, the lower court did not have jurisdiction over the parent's claim. Foster parents were defined and restricted by statute. Foster families did not have the same rights as biological families or adoptive families. In the instant action, the foster parent failed to demonstrate a specific, personal, and legal interest. The statutory protection provided to foster parents, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-466(f), did not apply because the instant action was not a habeas corpus action. The administrative proceedings held in the instant action did not qualify as a &quot;contested case&quot; because the agency was not required to determine the foster parent's legal interests.</SPAN></P>

It instructed the jury specifically that the factual circumstances in the evidence were left for it to pass upon. The example was not an unfair statement of the law of circumstantial evidence. It was neither a &quot;direction&quot; to the jury nor a &quot;distinct intimation&quot; that this issue was not longer for it to decide. The trial court repeatedly informed the jury that it was the sole fact finder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother claimed the trial court improperly concluded that when adjudicating a petition for termination of parental rights, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-112(c)(1) did not require the court to find by clear and convincing evidence that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the child and parent where the court had previously made those findings. The commissioner argued the issue was moot. Although the appellate court concluded that the claim was not moot, the mother's claim lacked merit. The mother also argued the child protection judge's reliance on the trial judge's determinations regarding reunification was improper because the trial judge's decisions were not supported by clear and convincing evidence, and the child protection judge did not make a finding by clear and convincing evidence. The appellate court noted that statute did not require the child protection judge to make the finding herself because the trial judge did so. Finally, the mother claimed Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-110 was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the mother could not prevail on the claim because it was not raised at trial and failed to satisfy all four prongs of Golding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A client of the attorney had filed a grievance against him as a result of an excessive and inappropriate fee.

The attorney was also ordered to participate in arbitration to determine a reasonable fee. The attorney failed to comply with the committee's orders. The committee then filed a presentment against the attorney. The trial court upheld the committee's orders and suspended the attorney for 90 days. The appellate court held the attorney had waived his opportunity to argue the constitutionality of the statute by initially failing to respond. Because the court's finding that the attorney had waived the right to contest the decision was supported by the record, it was not clearly erroneous. Furthermore, because the appellate court upheld the trial court's finding on waiver, it did not consider the attorney's constitutional claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff patient's medical malpractice action, the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut) entered a judgment granting the motions for summary judgment filed by defendants, hospital and pathologists, on their defense that the patient's action was time-barred pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the patient claimed that the trial court's judgment was improper, because: (1) the repose section of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584 was tolled by the continuing course of conduct doctrine; and (2) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584 barred his claim before he could have known that he had suffered actionable harm, in violation of the United States and Connecticut Constitutions. The appellate court held that there was no initial duty for the hospital or the pathologists to provide follow-up treatment or to instruct the patient on follow-up care. Therefore, there was no subsequent wrongful misconduct and no genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was a continuing duty. Furthermore, although Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584 resulted in disparate treatment for individuals, such as the patient, who did not discover their injury within the three-year limitations period, the classification bore a reasonable relationship to the legislature's goal of limiting the legal consequences of wrongs to a controllable degree. Accordingly, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584 was constitutional as applied to the patient.</SPAN></P>

Although the parties' accounts of the altercation varied greatly, the administrative law judge's credibility determinations were entitled to deference, and there was no evidence indicating she was biased. Substantial evidence that the provider refused to permit an inspection was grounds enough in itself to warrant revocation. The provider's due process rights were also not violated. There was no impropriety in allowing an agency to conduct its own adjudications, and she was clearly provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut) dismissing their appeal from the decision of defendant zoning board of appeals upholding the action of the town's zoning enforcement officer, who issued a cease and desist order to the landowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties agreed that when the town enacted zoning regulations, the landowners' use of their property as a quarry became a valid, preexisting, nonconforming use. The landowners continued to operate the quarry for several decades. The town later enacted a regulation permitting the use of the property as a quarry, subject to a special permit. The landowners were granted such a permit, and renewed it twice. At the last expiration of the permit, the landowners did not seek a further renewal but continued their operation of the land as a quarry. The town's zoning enforcement officer ordered the landowners to cease the operation of their quarry for their failure to renew the permit. The trial court held that even if the landowners' use continued to be a valid, preexisting, nonconforming use, the appeal still failed because nonconforming uses were subject to regulation in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare. The appellate court agreed. The landowners acquired, and continued to have, a valid, preexisting nonconforming use. The requirement that the landowners obtain a permit, however, was a reasonable regulation of its nonconforming use under the town's police powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford (Connecticut) entered a judgment which: (1) convicted defendant of first degree robbery under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-134(a)(4), and of violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-202k; and (2) sentenced him to a 20-year prison term, suspended after 15 years, and 5 years' probation on the robbery conviction, and to a consecutive 5-year term under &sect; 53-202k. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from his use of a sawed-off, single-barreled shotgun to rob the victim of her car and her pocketbook, which contained two or three credit cards and cash. On appeal, defendant raised numerous assignments of error. The appellate court held, first, that the State was not precluded from prosecuting defendant for the robbery on double jeopardy grounds, because there was no constitutional prohibition against a state prosecution for the same acts which had resulted in a federal prosecution. Second, the evidence was sufficient to support the robbery conviction, because the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the robber. Third, defendant's motion to suppress the victim's credit cards was properly denied, because the search that yielded the credit cards was incident to his lawful arrest. Finally, the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on either of the two elements of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-202k was harmless error, because the jury would have found that defendant was subject to a sentence enhancement under &sect; 53-202k had it been properly instructed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured first claimed the trial court improperly reduced her economic damages on the basis of collateral source benefits. The court reduced the amount of verdict to zero because the amount paid by collateral sources greatly exceeded the jury award. The result was consistent with legislative intent to prevent double recoveries. Second, she claimed abuse of discretion in the trial court's refusal to submit certain interrogatories to the jury. She brought a one count cause of action, so it was within the trial court's discretion to deny her request. It was not an abuse of discretion. The third claim was that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-225a was unconstitutionally vague as it applied to her because it did not require a jury to make specific awards for past and future economic damages. However, the injured cited no Connecticut or federal law in support of her position and provided no legal analysis. The final claim was that the driver's counsel made prejudicial comments that caused the jury to view her claims unfairly. The injured's counsel did not object to the remarks at the time they were made or at the conclusion of the argument, so the claim was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in jail awaiting trial on a murder charge when a guard intercepted a letter that exhorted another person to murder the chief witness against him. The appeals court reversed his conviction of attempted murder on charges arising out of these facts. It noted that Connecticut's attempt statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-49(a), and its solicitation statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-179a(a), maintained the common law distinction between these two inchoate offenses. The legislative history of several revisions of the criminal statutes supported this interpretation. The facts alleged in the charging instrument made out a solicitation of murder, not an attempt, which required an overt endeavor toward the commission of the offense. Since the evidence was insufficient to find defendant guilty of attempted murder beyond a reasonable doubt, his conviction violated due process and was plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was an employee who recovered workers compensation benefits from defendant employer for retaliatory discharge. A decision of the Workers' Compensation Review Board (Connecticut) affirmed the workers' compensation commissioner's decision to reduce the employee's attorney's fees and to deny the attorney's motion to open and modify that decision. The attorney appealed the board's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee and the attorney entered into an agreement whereby the attorney's fees were to be one-third of the gross award including the amount denominated as reasonable attorney's fees. The commissioner's award for the employer's retaliatory discharge included $ 50,000 for attorney's fees. Both parties appealed, and then settled. The settlement included $ 90,000 for attorney's fees. The gross award was calculated by the attorney to be $ 390,762. The attorney claimed the employee owed him $ 130,254 attorney's fees. The employee retained separate counsel to contest the attorney's fees. The board affirmed the commissioner's award of $ 75,000 attorney's fees. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-290a(b)(2) provided for attorney's fees for a successful workers' compensation claimant. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-327(a), (b) provided that the commissioner could award such fees and that all such fees were subject to the commissioner's approval. There was no distinction between fees awarded separately and fees combined with other compensation. The attorney's other claims were not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence derived from a warrantless entry onto his property. He argued that the search conducted by the police violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The appellate court agreed with defendant in part. It found that the officers' warrantless entry into defendant's front yard and front driveway to ticket unregistered vehicles was constitutional, because defendant had a lesser expectation of privacy in the area in front of the house. However, the officers' warrantless entry into defendant's backyard and rear driveway was unconstitutional, because defendant manifested an objective intent that the area be preserved as private. That intent was evidenced by his placement of a six-foot fence in the middle of the rear driveway and the &quot;no trespassing,&quot; &quot;keep out,&quot; and &quot;beware of dog&quot; signs. The rear areas in question were curtilage of the house and, thus, the privacy expectation in those areas was the same as that inside the house. To enter those areas without a warrant was a violation of defendant's rights under both U.S. Const. amend. IV and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court first noted that none of defendant's jury instruction issues were properly preserved at trial. Applying the Golding test for reviewing unpreserved claims of constitutional trial error, the appellate court held that although, the record was adequate for review and the issues were of constitutional magnitude, the claims failed because no constitutional violation clearly existed where the reasonable doubt jury instruction did not cause injustice, defendant's claims regarding the presumption of innocence instruction were inadequately briefed, and the jury instructions were correct in law, sufficient to guide the jury without misleading them, and resulted in no manifest injustice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of conspiracy to commit murder in violation of Conn.

The appellate court found the record simply did not contain evidence of separate acts and circumstances to support a prior agreement between the defendant and any of the alleged coconspirators. Accordingly, the defendant's conviction of conspiracy to commit murder was set aside. Further, the appellate court found that the defendant failed to demonstrate that the challenged language in the court's instruction unconstitutionally diluted the State's burden of proof. Additionally, the appellate court found that in most of the instances of defendant's five challenges, he failed to properly preserve error.

The appellate court affirmed the judgment, noting that it was not persuaded of the merits of any of defendant's unpreserved claims of impropriety. The appellate court first determined defendant's claim of instructional impropriety in the manslaughter charge was not a claim of constitutional magnitude and therefore did not permit Golding review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was convicted of drunk driving in Maine. Pursuant to an interstate driver's license compact, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-111c, originals and photocopies of various records were transmitted to Connecticut, where defendant commissioner of motor vehicles suspended his license. The court reviewed defendant's proceeding, and the trial court's affirmance of it, only to assure that they were supported by substantial evidence, and found that they were. Although Maine's drunk driving statute criminalized driving at a lower blood alcohol level than did the Connecticut statute, review of the record, particularly the penalties imposed in Maine, supported an inference that plaintiff's blood alcohol level far exceeded the limit under either statute. Finally, Maine appeared to have satisfactorily met all its obligations under the compact in supplying information.</SPAN></P>

The evidence of foreign conviction was sufficient, defendant and the trial court properly inferred therefrom that plaintiff's conduct would have constituted drunk driving in Connecticut, and Maine properly satisfied all statutory formalities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Superior Court in the judicial district of Fairfield (Connecticut), defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the third degree, unlawful restraint in the second degree, and risk of injury to a child. He appealed those convictions, challenging the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict, motion to dismiss a charge, and petition for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found defendant's assignments of error unpersuasive. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the unlawful restraint charge. The jury's verdict on that charge was not inconsistent with the verdict acquitting defendant of the charge of sexual assault in the first degree. Those two offenses required different elements. Factual inconsistency was not a ground for overturning a verdict. The jury reasonably could have found that defendant did not force the victim to have intercourse but did force the victim to masturbate him. The trial court also did not err in denying defendant's motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The lower court found, and the instant court agreed, that the new evidence presented was not likely to produce a different result. Cross-examination of the new witnesses would have undermined their credibility while the victim appeared credible. Finally, defendant did not demonstrate that the prosecutor's argument was so prejudicial that it deprived defendant of a fair hearing of his petition for a new trial. On that issue, defendant presented nothing but bare statements of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The unlawful restraint conviction was not inconsistent with the acquittal for first degree sexual assault. The lower court did not err in finding that defendant's newly discovered evidence would not have altered the outcome of the trial. Defendant did not demonstrate that overzealous prosecution denied him a fair hearing on his petition for new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sexual assault and unlawful restraint convictions, in Superior Court, Fairfield Judicial District (Connecticut), arguing trial court error in failing to suppress eyewitness identification evidence, denying his motion for acquittal, and instructing the jury in a misleading manner regarding the element of force.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A teenage sexual assault victim (victim) and her friend saw defendant several times the evening he eventually assaulted her. Both girls described defendant to police, and then victim identified him later that evening in a show-up at the hospital. Despite an officer's suggestive remarks, so many circumstances supported the identification's reliability that defendant's suppression motion was properly denied. The court then looked at the evidence supporting defendant's convictions of first- and second-degree sexual assault, and found sufficient evidence supporting the jury's finding of all elements, including force, beyond reasonable doubt, so the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to acquit. Finally, defendant failed to preserve his objection to the trial court's jury instruction defining the element of force. Since the court found no constitutional violation in the trial court's straightforward instruction based on statutory language, review was waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, because under the circumstances the identification was reliable, the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain all convictions, and since defendant failed to show the jury instruction violated his constitutional rights, he waived review of unpreserved error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), by jury, convicted defendant of first degree assault, carrying a weapon in a vehicle, and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-59(a)(1), 29-38, and 29-35(a). Defendant got a Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-202k 5 year term for committing a class B felony with a firearm, in addition to 25 years under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-35a(5). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A shooting victim said he did not know his assailant, gave conflicting incident accounts, then finally accused defendant. Defendant was convicted of first degree assault, carrying a weapon, and carrying a pistol without a permit, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-59(a)(1), 29-38, and 29-35(a) respectively. The trial court also found, as a matter of law, that defendant committed a class B felony with a firearm, warranting a mandatory, nonsuspendable five year prison term under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-202k. The court affirmed. Because the enhanced punishment exceeded the statutory maximum under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-35a(5), the trial court should have instructed the jury regarding the enhanced punishment provision under &sect; 53-202k. Although the jury, not the trial court, should have made the &sect; 53-202k factual determinations, the failure to instruct the jury of the &sect; 53-202k elements was harmless. The jury, having concluded that defendant shot the victim, could reasonably have inferred that defendant possessed the gun in his vehicle. The trial court was within its discretion to restrict defense cross-examination as to whether the victim had a gun.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Because the enhanced term defendant received for committing a felony with a firearm exceeded the statutory maximum for assault, the trial court should have instructed the jury as to the enhancement provisions rather than making the requisite factual determinations itself. That failure, however, was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured suffered injuries and losses as a result of an accident that occurred on Feb. 2, 1994 involving an uninsured vehicle. Plaintiff sought to recover from defendant insurance company the uninsured motorist benefits provided under an automobile insurance policy that had been issued to her on Aug. 21, 1993, and the uninsured motorist benefits provided under another insurance policy that had been issued to her parents on Sept. 23, 1993. The court held that plaintiff could recover under both policies because Conn.  Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-336(d), which prohibited the stacking of automobile insurance coverages, did not apply to insurance policies issued in the gap period between the enactment of the statute on July 1, 1993 and its effective date on Jan. 1, 1994. The reference in 1993 Conn. Acts 93-297, &sect; 29, to &quot;acts or omissions&quot; did not unambiguously foreclose plaintiff from enforcing the terms of gap policies permitting stacking. Although &sect; 38a-336(d) did not provide expressly for the continued enforceability of stacking provisions contained in gap insurance policies, the language was ambiguous and applying it retroactively would have overturned reasonable expectations.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant and plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that plaintiff's painting was not a mural, but a message bearing sign subject to zoning regulations. Section 3.20 did not infringe on plaintiff's right of free speech under U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV, because it did not regulate the content, but only the size as deemed necessary for traffic safety. The trial court should not have granted summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff's allegations of selective enforcement were insufficient as a matter of law. The specific identification of other alleged violations of the sign ordinance should have been a matter of proof at trial. The summary judgment was reversed as to plaintiff's claim of selective enforcement, but affirmed in other respects.</SPAN></P>

Cathinone was listed as a material considered a controlled substance in Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 21a-243-7(e). Khat contained, however small, a quantity of cathinone that caused a stimulant effect. The review of a dictionary definition of khat revealed it was a habituating stimulant. Appellant, a native of Somalia, was already aware of the stimulant characteristic of the substance because of its widespread use in that country.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a police officer tried to apprehend defendant on auto larceny charges, defendant nearly caused him to be crushed between cars. The account of this event was sufficient evidence to support jury's guilty finding on the charge of attempted assault, and criminal intent was properly inferred from circumstantial evidence. A reasonable doubt instruction that might been objectionable in isolation did not prejudice defendant where the charge as a whole emphasized the burden to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. There was no abuse of discretion in denying defendant's motion for bill of particulars because the long form of information used provided full information about charges. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's attempt to cross-examine the police officer about internal affairs investigation of his conduct during the alleged assault, because it had reviewed the witness's personnel records in camera and found them irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed convictions, because there was ample evidence to support attempt assault finding, reasonable doubt instruction was proper in the context of the whole charge, the long form information provided defendant sufficient notice of charges, and proper restriction of cross-examination to relevant topics was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs owned land abutting a pond created by defendants' dam. The Connecticut commissioner of environmental protection (commissioner), responsible by statute for dam safety, ordered defendants to repair, lower, or demolish the dam. Plaintiffs sought to enjoin lowering or demolition. Conn. Gen.

The court held that despite plaintiffs' arguments that agency review would be futile because the commissioner ordered the action, they still had to exhaust their administrative remedies. Repair of the dam was one of the options in the order, and there was no certainty that an administrative appeal would not have worked. Plaintiffs argued that the statutory procedures unconstitutionally burdened their appeal rights, but the court, having other grounds for decision, declined to decide a constitutional question first raised on appeal.</SPAN></P>

However, the record showed that appellant, without victim's consent, moved victim from the street to a place under a stairwell in an empty parking area, confined her there when she attempted to leave, and raped her. It did not matter that appellant's underlying motive in either moving victim from the street to the stairwell, or in confining her there, was to accomplish a rape. Such intent did not preclude a conviction for kidnapping. Sufficient evidence supported the conviction where victim was later observed to have red marks on her arms and throat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding that plaintiff registered nurse's aide had made verbally abusive remarks to a nursing home patient, defendant state department of public health ordered its finding to be filed with the state nurse aide registry. The appeals court affirmed the trial court judgment affirming in part defendant's determinations. Defendant had jurisdiction to hear the Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 19a-9, 19a-14 charges, and the charging instrument's reference to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1395i-3(g)(1)(C) did not destroy that jurisdiction. The statutory term &quot;resident abuse&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague; defendant could define that term according to terms familiar to those in the industry and on a case by case basis. &quot;Resident abuse&quot; included verbal abuse. Plaintiff was not subject to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. It was for the defendant, not the court, to weigh the credibility of the witness's testimony. The trial court did not err in concluding that &quot;adverse impact&quot; or &quot;harm&quot; was prerequisite to an abuse finding and that remand was necessary. In the instant case, a subjective, rather than objective, test was more appropriate for making that determination.</SPAN></P>

He took the telephones off their receivers. He restrained the victim by beating her with a hammer and threatening to take her life. He was found guilty of first degree sexual assault, second degree kidnapping and assault, and attempted first degree assault. The appellate court affirmed, holding the evidence provided ample basis for the jury's determination that defendant abducted the victim, and the challenged statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mother appealed the termination of her parental rights with respect to her three minor children. The court affirmed the decision. The court found that it was established by clear and convincing evidence that petitioner commissioner complied with the provisions of Conn. Gen.

The court determined that the record failed to establish that respondent was under a mental disability for purposes of equal protection of the law pursuant to Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court concluded that the failure of counsel to request the appointment of a guardian ad litem to protect the interests of respondent did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, because the record failed to disclose evidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to respondent's ability to understand the proceedings or to assist her counsel on her behalf.</SPAN></P>

Although there had been nearly a two year delay in bringing defendant to trial, and voir dire was not concluded until nearly two months after it began, defendant's statutory and constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated. Voir dire commenced within 30 days of when defendant filed his speedy trial motion, defendant's motion to dismiss was untimely because it was filed after voir dire began, and the delay in concluding voir dire did not weigh heavily against the State--that delay was caused by the State's decision to try defendant's accomplice first.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his robbery and burglary conviction on many grounds, most prominently sufficiency of identification evidence to support verdict.

Defendant's ineffective assistance claim could not be raised until after exhaustion of direct appeals. The sentence imposed did not abuse trial court's discretion where sentencing court considered all offenses proven and sentence was within statutory ranges. Defendant's attempt to raise mental incompetence issue for first time on appeal was unavailing because record was wholly inadequate to review this new claim.

In closing arguments, prosecutor made numerous pleas to the jurors to identify with victim, stated that society would be in trouble if defendant was acquitted, and asked the jury not victimize the victim again by acquitting him. On appeal the court remanded, ruling that because prosecutor repeatedly expressed personal opinions, appealed to the jurors' passions and emotions, and injected extraneous matters into the case during closing argument, defendant's motion for new trial was improperly denied. However, because the evidence established that exigent circumstances existed, the warrantless arrest and subsequent search of defendant was reasonable, and thus the motion to suppress was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant pleaded guilty to first-degree sexual assault, the agreement was for imprisonment followed by a term of probation. At sentencing, the court imposed several conditions on probation. Shortly before defendant's scheduled release, on motion of State's office of adult probation, the court added a condition that defendant undergo sex offender evaluation and treatment. The court held that Connecticut's probation statute provided broad discretion to a sentencing court in imposing conditions. The statute specifically authorized imposition of sex offender treatment conditions on persons convicted of defendant's offense. A statutory argument that court could only change conditions during period of release was inapplicable because office of adult probation had authority to modify without seeking court approval. Because defendant had bargained for a sentence including probation that was inherently modifiable, he did not allege a constitutional violation that could be reviewed despite his failure to raise the issue in trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed modification, because State had statutory authority to modify probation even without court approval; defendant did not allege violation of constitutional right when his guilty plea was given in exchange for a sentence that included probation, and terms of probation were always subject to change.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress photographic identification evidence where the witness had been unable to specifically identify defendant but had identified similar looking males from the photo array. Defendant was convicted of manslaughter. On appeal, the court held that the record did not show that the photographic array was unduly suggestive or that the officers who presented influenced the choices. The defendant failed to meet his burden of establishing that the identification resulted from the employment of an unconstitutional procedure by the police. The court found that the trial court properly denied the suppression motion, and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed, because the photographic array of possible perpetrators was not unduly suggestive and the officers presenting it did not so influence the identifying witness that identification resulted from unconstitutional police procedure; therefore, denial of the suppression motion was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the amount of time the children were left unattended was not a necessary element of the offense, and even if it were a necessary element, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the children were seriously at risk of injury to their health, or that their lives or limbs were endangered when they were left unattended. The court also concluded that Conn. Gen.

Defendant's violence toward the victim escalated. The victim obtained a protective order. One evening, the victim and her sister returned to victim's home from a night out. Defendant was waiting in the victim's driveway. He pulled out his gun, chased the victim, and shot her five times at close range. The victim died. On appeal, defendant asserted that an improper jury instruction on intoxication invalidated the instruction on extreme emotional disturbance. The court refused review of the claim because it was unpreserved and the improper jury instructions on the defense of extreme emotional disturbance was not of constitutional dimension. Next, defendant argued that defense counsel should have been permitted surrebuttal argument on the issue of extreme emotional disturbance. The court concluded that defendant failed to show surrebuttal argument was needed to protect the constitutional right of due process. The court rejected defendant's challenge to a jury instruction on reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
