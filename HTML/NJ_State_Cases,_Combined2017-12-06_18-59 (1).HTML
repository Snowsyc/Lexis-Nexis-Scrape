HOLDINGS: [1]-Pursuant to N.J.A.C. 18:7-8.12(e), interest income plaintiffs received from New Jersey borrowers was allocated to the numerator of the receipts fraction of the allocation formula because it was derived from sources in New Jersey; [2]-The interchange--the fee the bank issuing the credit card charged the merchant bank, which constituted interest--was fully allocable to New Jersey; [3]-Under N.J.A.C. 18:7-8.10(c), 50 percent of the service fees received by plaintiffs was allocated to New Jersey, as that was the State where the service was processed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">HOLDINGS: [1]-In an action involving the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation's (Director's) decision of a vehicle leasing company's Corporate Business Tax (CBT) obligations for fiscal years 2003 through 2006, the court concluded that New Jersey's decoupling from the federal bonus depreciation statute enacted in the wake of the events of September 11, 2001, with regard to 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 168, was effective beginning with the company's fiscal year commencing October 1, 2002, and applied to vehicles purchased after September 10, 2001, even if they were purchased prior to the start of that fiscal year; (2) The court held that the Director's removal under the Throw-Out Rule, N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:10A-6(B)(6), of the company's out of state receipts from the denominator of the receipts fraction used to determine its CBT liability was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, a city and its board of water commissioners, and defendant township filed competing motions for summary judgment in plaintiffs' suit seeking temporary restraints and injunctive relief enjoining defendant from conducting a tax sale due to delinquent property taxes. Defendant imposed local real property tax assessments upon 40 properties used by plaintiffs for tax years 2009 and 2010.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs asserted that the assessments at issue were grossly excessive, thus, erroneous and unconstitutional. Plaintiffs contended that the proposed tax certificate sale violated the New Jersey Green Acres Land Acquisition and Recreation Opportunities Act (Green Acres Act), N.J.S.A. &sect; 13:8A-35 et seq., and that portions were statutorily tax-exempt as being used for public purposes, pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:4-3.3. The court held that plaintiffs failed to timely challenge the assessments. Further, the court held that plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to the assessments claimed exempt did not toll or waive application of the statute of limitations. Therefore, the court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' appeals, pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:4-21. However, the court did find that it had jurisdiction to decide the count asserted in the complaint under the Green Acres Act.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, a New Jersey S Corporation and its owners, filed a cross motion for summary judgment. At issue in the case was an interpretation and application of the Gross Income Tax (GIT) statute,&nbsp;N.J.S.A. &sect; 54A:4-1 and the Director's regulations interpreting the same.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue presented was whether plaintiffs was eligible for a GIT credit for income taxes paid to New York on passed-through S corporation income. Defendant denied a credit because the S corporation allocated 100 percent of its income to New Jersey, and pursuant to the GIT statute,&nbsp;N.J.S.A. &sect; 54A:4-1(c), no credit is allowed for S corporation income so allocated. It was undisputed that much of the S corporation income was earned and sourced in New York. Since they paid New York personal income tax upon the passed-through S corporation income sourced in New York, plaintiffs maintained that they should receive a credit for the same against their GIT liability. The court agreed with plaintiffs and held that they were entitled to a GIT credit. The court held that the statutory denial of the GIT credit for S corporation income allocated to New Jersey did not supersede the scope and intent of the GIT credit provision of preventing multiple income taxation on the same income. The court held that to the extent the Director applied its regulations in a rigid and technical manner for S corporation income required to be allocated 100 percent to New Jersey, such application was incorrect.</SPAN></P>

The court held that when construed as subjecting a local exchange company to tax on its business personal property when it provides dial tone and access to 51 percent of a local exchange as of the annual assessment date, &sect; 54:4-1 comports with federal and state guarantees of equal protection, does not constitute special legislation, and does not violate the Uniformity Clause, N.J.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer, acting pro se, sued defendant, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation, challenging an assessment of sales and use tax. Plaintiff filed a letter the court construed to be a motion for summary judgment. Pursuant to R. 4:46-2(c), the Director moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis it was untimely under N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:49-18(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer sought of refund of taxes that were used to satisfy the sales and use tax obligation incurred by his corporate business. He claimed that the Director's claims were expunged during his bankruptcy proceeding and that the Director was prohibited from attempting to collect the debt owed. The tax court disagreed. Pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 349, the dismissal of the taxpayer's bankruptcy case meant that the Director's assessment against him was neither expunged nor discharged by the bankruptcy court. The taxpayer's motion for summary judgment did not comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of R. 4:46-2, and failed on the merits because he failed to file a request for a tax refund within four years of payment, as mandated by N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:32B-20(a). The Director's motion to dismiss was well taken; because the taxpayer did not file the instant complaint  within the mandatory 90-day period required by N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:49-18(a) and R. 8:4-1(B), the tax liability assessed against him was deemed fixed and final.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Based on Oberhand v. Director, Division of Taxation, plaintiff estate sought a refund of estate taxes paid pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:38-1. Defendant, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation, denied the refund claim. The estate appealed; the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent died on March 22, 2002. On July 1, 2002, to prevent revenue loss from changes in federal estate tax, the legislature amended &sect; 54:38-1 and made the amendment retroactive to January 1, 2002. Relying on Oberhand, where the State's high court applied the doctrine of manifest injustice to eliminate the retroactive application of &sect; 54:38-1 to decedents' estates, the estate sought a tax refund. The tax court found the instant case distinguishable from Oberhand because there was no evidence the decedent relied to his detriment on the prior version of &sect; 54:38-1. His will simply passed his estate to his wife or to his daughter, if his wife predeceased him. The retroactivity of &sect; 54:38-1 did not violate equal protection principles of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1, as the different classification of persons dying between January 1 and June 30, 2002 and those dying thereafter was rationally related to the State's appropriate interest in preventing revenue loss from changes in federal estate tax law. As the retroactive period of &sect; 54:38-1 was brief, was enacted to remedy a revenue loss, and did not create a new tax, it did not violate federal due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Director's motion for summary judgment was granted and the estate's cross-motion was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff claimed it provided temporary labor services, which were not an enumerated category of service subject to sales tax. The court found that declaratory relief was appropriate in the action because defendant's notice, which was sent only to plaintiff based upon defendant's review of plaintiff's documents, was received in the context of prior settled litigation involving the identical issue, which created a justiciable controversy between adverse parties. However, a declaratory judgment based upon the parties' respective summary judgment motions was inappropriate because material facts needed to be established as to the nature of plaintiff's business activities after the 2008 calendar year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court set forth its decision concerning the cross-motions for summary judgment filed by plaintiff, a communications corporation, and defendant, the Director of the Division of Taxation. At issue was plaintiff's entitlement to a refund, pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:32B-8.13(c), for sales taxes paid on machinery, equipment or apparatus (MEA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Director argued that plaintiff could not claim a refund under N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:30B-20(a) since it was actually a subsidiary who paid the tax on the MEA, and not plaintiff. The court disagreed and found that a purchase occurred when the vendors transferred possession of the MEA to plaintiff or a related corporate entity and that the vendors were paid by a related corporate entity of plaintiff. Thus, plaintiff was a customer for the purposes of &sect; 54:32B-20(a). The court noted that a related corporate entity of plaintiff, rather than a third-party, remitted the checks to the vendors in exchange for the transfer of possession of the MEA. Thus, plaintiff was a customer who had actually paid the tax under &sect; 54:32B-20(a). Therefore, plaintiff was a proper party to pursue a refund claim under N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:32B-8.13(c). The court found, however, that the genuine issues of material fact existed as to the primary function or use of the MEA, which precluded summary judgment on the issue of whether plaintiff met all of the statutory requirements under N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:32B-8.13(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted, in part, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment with regard to it being a proper party to seek the refund. However, the court denied plaintiff's motion, in part, as genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether plaintiff had satisfied all of the statutory elements to be entitled to a refund. The court denied the Director's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer sued defendants, the State and the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation, seeking a declaration that an amendment to the premium tax cap statute,&nbsp;N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:18A-6, was unconstitutional, a refund of taxes, and an order restraining and enjoining defendants from imposing and collecting any additional taxes based on the amendment. The taxpayer and the Director filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer, as New Jersey's only qualified health service corporation (HSC), had been fully exempt from premium taxes under N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:18A-1 until enactment of the amendment, which occurred after it ended discussions with state officials about converting to a for-profit entity. It argued that the amendment violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court disagreed. The timing of the amendment alone was too speculative to prove the legislature had a retaliatory motive. It was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose--increased revenue--and the classification was legitimate as it included all members of the HSC class. Though the HCS class had one member--the taxpayer--as the amendment rested upon a reasonable basis and did not exclude entities that should have been included, it was not an improper special law under N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 9(6). It was not a bill of attainder, since it furthered nonpunitive legislative goals. As the evidence was insufficient to show that the legislature acted with improper intent, there was no manifest injustice in the retroactive application of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

The corporation also sought a refund of the $ 1,480,524  in CBT it paid on its 2003 CBT return for fiscal year 2003, plus interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Director sought to affirm her final assessment determination and deny any refund to the corporation. The corporation was a limited partner for a banking information solutions division of a larger corporation. The limited partnership agreement provided that the general partner had the sole and exclusive right to manage the business and affairs of the solutions division except for limited decisions specifically reserved to the limited partner, the corporation. The corporation did not have the right or the obligation to participate directly or indirectly in the active management of the solutions division. The court held that the corporation was entitled to the abatement of the CBT, including interest and penalties. The court found that the Director erred by applying a regulation enacted in 2006 to the corporation as its interest in the solutions division was an investment/passive investor since it had no control or potential control in the limited partnership. As to the refund sought, the court held that the corporation was entitled to a refund of the CBT it paid during 2003 since the corporation did not have a sufficient nexus with New Jersey to justify the CBT payment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation, assessed a use tax under N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:32B-6 (2002), plus penalties and interest, against plaintiff taxpayer for the time its yacht was docked in New Jersey. The taxpayer filed suit to contest the assessment; both parties filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer was a limited liability company registered in Delaware. Its members were New Jersey residents. While awaiting charters, the taxpayer's yacht was kept in New Jersey. During that time, some crew members went on vacation, non-routine maintenance and outfitting were performed, and new crew members were hired and trained. The court held that, while docked in New Jersey, the yacht was in the State for the taxpayer's business purposes. The Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, permitted an unapportioned use tax to be imposed on personal property with sufficient nexus with New Jersey so long as there was no risk of multiple taxation. The taxpayer's use of the yacht in New Jersey was a sufficient nexus with the State to subject it to use tax there. The recruiting and training of a new crew in New Jersey was an interruption of the yacht's exclusively interstate activities. As the yacht was not used entirely in interstate commerce, the taxpayer was not a nonresident for purposes of N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:32B-11(2) of the New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Act. Thus, the apportioned use tax imposed on the taxpayer was constitutionally permissible and statutorily authorized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners contended that a compliance plan reassessing all of the apartment properties in the borough violated the Uniformity Clause, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, para. 1(a), because the assessor relied solely on the sales of six apartment properties in concluding that all such properties were undervalued, despite the fact that he had earlier determined that those six sales were nonusable for purposes of the annual study conducted by the Director of the ratio of assessments to market value. The court disagreed. The use of nonusable sales in evaluating the need for a compliance plan was not per se invalid, as there was sufficient other evidence derived from the income approach to conclude that defendants' reasonably determined that the owners' properties were under-assessed and that a compliance plan was warranted. The Division's witness testified that the primary reason for reassessment was the borough's rental decontrol ordinance. Selection of the owners' apartment properties (and all other apartment properties in the borough) for reassessment was reasonable because the implementation of rent decontrol tended to increase the market values of such properties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed an assessment of a use tax imposed by defendant, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer bought a boat in Florida and docked it in Jersey City. It paid use tax on the boat at three percent of the purchase price. The use tax rate under N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:32B-6 of the New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 54:32B-1 to -27, was then six percent. The taxpayer argued that Jersey City was a designated urban enterprise zone in which the sales tax rate was three percent. The Director assessed tax using the six percent rate, on grounds the taxpayer did not buy the boat from a qualified vendor in a designated enterprise zone. The tax court held that as the taxpayer did not buy the boat in Jersey City, it did not qualify for N.J.S.A. 52:27H-80's 50 percent sales tax exemption. The taxpayer argued that imposing a six percent use tax violated the Commerce Clause. The tax court held that if the taxpayer actually could have purchased the boat from a qualified vendor in Jersey City when the boat was docked there, the use tax was unconstitutional. As the taxpayer's affidavit stated there were three qualified vendors in Jersey City, and the Director's affidavit stated there were none, an issue of fact was presented, precluding entry of summary judgment for the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Director was granted summary judgment as to her determination that the taxpayer was not entitled to a sales tax reduction. Her motion to dismiss the appeal was denied, as was the taxpayer's motion for summary judgment declaring imposition of the use tax unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer sued defendants, a state university and a township, seeking to invalidate an exemption from local property taxation granted pursuant to N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:4-3.3 to the university's apartment buildings used to house graduate students, their spouses or domestic or civil union partners, and dependent children. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint with prejudice under R. 4:6-2 for failure to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The complaint contended the township's taxpayers had been unfairly burdened by providing children living in the university's family housing with free public school education. The court initially held that as appeals from assessments were made on an annual basis, the taxpayer was only entitled to a judgment determining the validity of the exemption for the tax year at issue. As the university's property was impressed with a public trust for the higher education of New Jersey residents, N.J.S.A. &sect;18A: 65-2, the family housing had to be used for a public purpose in order to be entitled to an exemption under &sect; 54:4-3.3. Providing residential housing for its students was an appropriate undertaking by a state university, and the legislature  gave the university ample authority to construct and maintain such housing. The public purpose of providing housing for graduate students and their spouses, domestic or civil union partners, and children did not destroy the public purpose of providing student housing; rather, it advanced the  policies embodied in the New Jersey Law against Discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation applied the New Jersey Throwout Rule, N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:10A-6 of the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 54:10A-1 to -41, in assessing the corporation business tax against plaintiff taxpayers. The taxpayers appealed, alleging the Rule violated the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the Commerce and Supremacy Clauses. All parties moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers argued that the Rule facially violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, and the Due Process Clause by enabling New Jersey to tax income generated in a foreign state, but not taxable there, where New Jersey had not contributed to the generation of the income. The foreign state income might not be taxable in that state, and thus subject to the Rule, because the state did not impose a tax or because 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 prohibited taxation of the income in the state. Thus, argued the taxpayers, the Rule also violated the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. The tax court held that the Rule was facially constitutional under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses since, in at least some circumstances, it could operate in a manner satisfying the U.S. Supreme Court's requirements. Further, N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:10A-8 obliged the Director to ensure that the allocation of income to New Jersey was fair under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses. And as noting in &sect; 381 barred a state from which goods were sold from taxing income generated from sales of goods to foreign states that could not tax the income, the Rule did not violate the Supremacy Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The tax court denied the taxpayers' summary judgment motions and granted the Director's motions for partial summary judgment. Separate proceedings for each taxpayer were required to determine whether the Rule was unconstitutional as applied to them, and, as to two taxpayers, whether they were subject to taxation in New Jersey.</SPAN></P>

The additional assessment was based on the Director's conclusion that the taxpayer did not maintain a regular place of business outside of New Jersey and, thus, was not entitled to allocate income away from New Jersey under N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:10A-6, Section 6. As such, the Director was compelled to use the formula set forth under N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:10A-8, Section 8. The court upheld the Director's assessments, concluding that the taxpayer did not meet the statutory and regulatory requirements of maintaining a regular place of business outside of New Jersey to apportion income under the Section 6 formula.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant supermarkets filed a motion made in lieu of answer, pursuant to R. 4:6-2(e), to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiff customers filed the class action suit alleging violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 56:8-1 to -20, and breach of fiduciary duty, common law fraud, and negligent taxation, with regard to defendants' overcharging sales tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs alleged that defendants overcharged the amount of sales tax that was due on purchases made by computing the sales tax based on the regular price of the items purchased rather than on the reduced or discounted sales price actually charged for the items, particularly in transactions where plaintiffs used store coupons or used a shopper's club card issued by defendants. The court noted that the specific issue raised by defendants' motion was whether a claim made pursuant to the CFA may be maintained against a vendor who is alleged to have collected more sales tax than was required by the Sales and Use Tax Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 54:32B-1 to -29. The court held that there was a direct and unavoidable conflict between the Sales and Use Tax Act and application of the CFA to the facts of the case since the Director of the Division of Taxation had the exclusive initial jurisdiction to determine whether any tax was due and judicial review was available only after she has made a determination or took some action with respect to a claim for refund of taxes that have already been remitted to the Director. As such, plaintiffs' claims were not maintainable against defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation, filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff taxpayer's complaint on the grounds that plaintiff's refund claim for sales tax paid was filed over two years after the four-year refund claim period established by N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:32B-20(a), a provision of the Sales and Use Tax Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 54:32B-1 to -29. Plaintiff had filed an amended claim seeking a refund of $ 46,694.57 in sales tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The refund claim, which was for November 1998 through April 1999, was based on plaintiff's contention that purchases of certain items by it were not subject to sales tax. Plaintiff submitted a list of the items and the invoices on which the tax allegedly was improperly paid. The Director issued a final determination, which granted a refund of $ 410.53 and denied the balance of the claim. In opposition to the motion to dismiss, plaintiff contended that the four-year time limit could and should be relaxed and relied on the doctrines of waiver, equitable estoppel, and laches. The court concluded that plaintiff's refund claim was untimely since it was filed over two years after the four-year time limit established by &sect; 54:32B-20(a) had expired. The court found that the Director's motion to dismiss, based on such untimely filing, was itself timely, and that the facts, when construed most favorably to plaintiff, were insufficient to demonstrate that the doctrines of waiver, equitable estoppel, or laches applied to deny the Director relief in this matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the Director's motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 54:10A-1 to -41, defendant Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation imposed a business tax on plaintiff taxpayer. The taxpayer appealed; the Director moved to dismiss the Third Count of the taxpayer's complaint which sought relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer argued that New Jersey's Throw Out Rule, N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:10A-6(B), was unconstitutional, either facially or as applied. Its complaint also alleged that the amount of taxes in controversy, approximately $ 144,000, was less than the cost of litigating its claims, and that because the maximum amount of legal fees it could recover under N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:51A-22 if it prevailed was $ 15,000, whereas 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 allowed recovery of &quot;reasonable fees&quot; to a prevailing plaintiff in a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action, the remedies provided by New Jersey law were inadequate. The tax court noted that state courts were precluded from providing &sect; 1983 relief if state law provided an adequate remedy for relief from unconstitutional tax assessments. New Jersey's system provided such a remedy. A state remedy did not have to be identical to &sect; 1983 remedies; it needed only to satisfy minimum procedural criteria. That the taxpayer's counsel fees might exceed the amount of tax at issue did not render inadequate the remedies provided by New Jersey for an allegedly unconstitutional tax assessment. The availability of &sect; 1983 relief was not a function of counsel's hourly rate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayers filed a class action suit against defendants, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation, a county board of taxation, a borough, and its elected officials, challenging the constitutionality of L. 2001, c. 101 (Chapter 101). Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and for mootness. Also at issue was whether class certification was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The borough's assessor sought leave to review and, if necessary, revise assessments of certain properties. The Director approved the assessor's application for the compliance plan under Chapter 101, which amended N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:4-23. The taxpayers alleged the compliance plan was illegal spot assessment and Chapter 101 was invalid as enacted and as applied. The court held that as Chapter 101 was not a revenue-raising measure, it did not violate the Bill Origination Clause, N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6, para. 1. Since R. 4:32 did not apply to local property tax appeals, and R. 8:3-1(b) required filing of a separate complaint for each separately assessed property, class certification was not proper. As Chapter 101 directed reassessment when there was reason to believe property was assessed at a value lower or higher than was consistent with securing uniform taxable valuation, it did not facially violate the Uniformity Clause, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, para. 1(a); nor did it violate the Equal Protection Clause. Claims against the officials failed, as they were not obliged to approve or disprove the plan. Taxpayers whose assessments were reduced due to the plan failed to state a claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that Chapter 101 was facially constitutional and that class certification was not appropriate. The taxpayers could still establish that the particular assessment compliance plan was invalid as applied. The complaint failed to state a claim as to the elected officials. The court dismissed four counts of the complaints, and the entirety of the complaints filed by taxpayers whose assessments went down due to the plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Assets transferred to the taxpayer by its parent corporation had been placed in service before New Jersey uncoupled from federal accelerated depreciation.  The parent corporation depreciated the assets using the straight-line method rather than the accelerated depreciation allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. After the transfer, the taxpayer continued to depreciate the assets using the same basis and the same straight-line depreciation method. Relying on N.J.S.A. &sect; 54:10A-4(k)(2)(F) of the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Act, N.J.S.A. &sect;&sect; 54:10A-1 to -41, as well as  N.J.A.C. 18:7-5.2, the Director disallowed the taxpayer's straight-line depreciation deductions on grounds the parent's failure to take the excess depreciation adjustment was contrary to 18:7-5.2(a)2(v). The court disagreed. Under the clear language of 18:7-5.2(a)2)(v), the parent corporation was allowed, but not required, to take an excess depreciation deduction. Nothing in 18:7-5.2(a)2(v) precluded the taxpayer from assuming the higher depreciable basis of the transferred assets due to the parent corporation's decision not to take the excess depreciation deduction.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer filed amended returns for the 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 tax years, seeking a refund of the taxes it paid pursuant to the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax (CBT) Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54:10A-1 to -40.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer, a public electric company, argued that the way in which the provisions of the CBT Act and the New Jersey Franchise and Gross Receipts Tax (F&amp;GRT) Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54:30A-16 to -67 (1998), were worded for the years 1994 to 1997, it was not liable for either tax in those years. The parties did agree that the taxpayer was not subject to both taxes, the taxpayer had no liability under the F&amp;GRT Act because it had no receipts from retail sales in New Jersey for those years, and the taxpayer was subject to tax under the CBT Act unless it was exempted under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-3(f) or was constitutionally protected from being taxed. The court held that although the taxpayer was a public utility because of its in-state activities, it was not liable for the F&amp;GRT because it did not have retail sales of electricity in New Jersey during the tax years in question. The court held that the taxpayer was subject to the CBT, because no constitutional infirmity existed and, although the taxpayer was a public utility, exemption from the CBT was based on the taxpayer having had to actually pay F&amp;GRT, which it was not subject to for those years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer moved and defendant town cross-moved for summary judgment in the taxpayer's challenge to an increase in the tax assessment on its industrial property. It argued that pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-23 and N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, &sect; 12A-1.14, as amended by 2001 N.J. Laws ch. 101, its property could not be reassessed in the absence of a compliance plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">For two years, the taxpayer refused to appeal assessments out of fear that its industrial property would be assessed at a higher value. When the town's assessing authority finally assessed the property, in a year between major reassessments, it raised the assessment considerably. The taxpayer argued that under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-23, the assessment could only be raised after an individual assessment if a compliance plan had been filed. The court looked to the plain statutory language, to the regulation implementing it, to evidence contemporaneous with the statute's enactment, and to the whole statutory scheme and found that the compliance plan requirement only applied to revised assessments that affected a portion of a neighborhood or an area, as these were likely to affect the remaining properties, not to a revised assessment of a single property. Because the assessment was handled properly, it was not necessary to address the town's constitutional arguments; nonetheless, the court noted that the argument was meritless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the summary judgment motion, as well as the town's cross-motion for summary judgment on constitutional grounds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff township determined that defendants, the State's highway and/or turnpike authorities, were no longer exempt from property taxes on an arts center complex and amphitheater facilities at the complex. The authorities sought review in several consolidated actions. The Appellate Division (New Jersey) remanded the case to the court with instructions to determine if the complex's present use was contemplated by 1968 N.J. Laws 348, as amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A state arts center property was exempt under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:12B-16 as a &quot;highway project&quot; only if its use for a year at issue was contemplated by 1968 N.J. Laws 348, as amended. 2003 N.J. Laws 79, the &quot;Merger Legislation,&quot; transferred the highway authority to the turnpike authority and did not extend or enlarge the N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:12B-16 exemption. The exemption was granted for amphitheater facilities for 1996 and denied for those and all other facilities after 1996. The exemption was lost because the properties' use changed from the prescribed use. The N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:12B-16 prescribed use contemplated certain properties and certain discrete public purposes. The use had become revenue motivated. The properties had enlarged, and new properties had been added. The properties were operated by a for-profit entity instead of by the nonprofit authority. The properties' use for a public purpose and the properties' ownership were not determinative. Under &sect; 27:12B-16, the only test for exemption was whether the use was the statutorily prescribed use. Public purpose and ownership were but two factors to determine if the properties were used as statutorily prescribed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court allowed the exemption for 1996 for the amphitheater facilities. The court otherwise denied the exemption for 1996-2004 for all properties, except for 2003, which was not appealed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent was the Director of the Division of Taxation (New Jersey). The Director assessed railroad franchise taxes under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:29A-14 of the New Jersey Railroad Franchise Tax (RFT), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54:29A-13 to -15, against petitioner taxpayers using the N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:29A-14 track mileage allocation formula to find New Jersey's share of their total income. The taxpayers appealed. The parties moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The formula, as applied, did not violate the (1) Commerce Clause, U. S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, (2) Due Process Clauses, and (2) Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11501 (4R Act). The formula used only the reported track miles over which the taxpayers actually operated (1) in New Jersey, as the numerator, and (2) in all states, as the denominator of a fraction. The fraction was multiplied times the taxpayer's income to compute its New Jersey income subject to the 10 percent RFT. Both taxpayers failed to carry their burden to prove by clear and cogent evidence that the income attributed to New Jersey was in fact out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted in New Jersey. The use of a single-factor formula was permissible. The taxpayers did not provide historical income statements to prove a disproportion. The taxpayers' use of ton-mile and shared-track allocation methods to illustrate how those methods produced a lower tax was not evidence to prove a disproportion. Since the RFT 10 percent tax was calculated differently than the nine percent tax on corporate income, the RFT tax did not discriminate against railroads and violate the 4R Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the assessments under review, denied the taxpayers' motions for summary judgment, and granted the Director's cross-motion motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, an estate executor, appealed an assessment of the State of New Jersey estate tax imposed by defendant, Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation (the Director).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The assessment, in the amount of $ 25,915.49 plus interest, resulted from the retroactive application of amendments to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:38-1, which were enacted after the date of death of the executor's decedent. The amendments constituted New Jersey's response to changes in the federal estate tax law. Under their express provisions, the amendments were effective as of a date preceding the decedent's date of death. If the amendments had not been enacted, the estate's New Jersey estate tax obligation would have been zero instead of almost $ 26,000. The court found that the decedent reasonably relied on existing federal and New Jersey estate tax law in preparing her will and in not amending it before her death. The court determined that New Jersey's fiscal concerns were insufficient to outweigh the decedent's reliance and that it was unfair to apply the amendments retroactively to impose on the estate a tax specifically and expressly sought to have been avoided by crafting her estate plan in accordance with existing law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff oil company moved for a declaration that the first paragraph of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-1, which characterized certain refinery equipment as personal property for assessment purposes, violated: N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, para. 1; art. IV, &sect; 6, para. 1; and art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 9, and that this violation rendered defendant town's tax assessment against its refinery property invalid. It also argued that a presumption was rebuttable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Although the town had long assessed the company's refinery equipment as real property, treating the items as fixtures pursuant to &sect; 54:4-1, it began assessing it as personal property and, in the company's case, the assessment went up. The court held, first, that since, under common law rules, the equipment would have been regarded as personal property rather than real property at the time the New Jersey Constitution was drafted, the Uniformity Clause, which required real property to be assessed uniformly, was not violated by a recharacterization of the property. Since the statute dealt with recharacterization, and did not impose any tax, it did not fall under the Origination Clause that required revenue raising measures to originate in the lower house of the legislature. Finally, the measure was not an invalid special tax law because it treated all refineries and their property the same. The company's argument that a presumption regarding valuation of tangible personal property should be rebuttable was premature, given that the property had not yet been officially valued as tangible personal property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the oil company's motion. It further declined to rule on the presumption, as the issue was not ripe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff foreign insurers moved for summary judgment on their claims for refunds of retaliatory taxes assessed against them pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:32-15, and defendant Director of New Jersey's Division of Taxation cross-moved for summary judgment denying refunds. The insurers argued that the N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Before addressing the insurers' claims that application of the two statutes to them violated equal protection principles, it looked to whether there was a legislative intent to apply both statutes to the insurers. Since the two statutes had very separate legislative histories and did not refer to each other, and since they could feasibly be applied at the same time, the court found no implication that one provision repealed the other. Moreover, the statutes did not violate equal protection because each rationally related to a valid legislative objective. Retaliatory tax provisions passed constitutional muster because they encouraged states to allow greater interstate commerce in insurance and the cap on premium taxation for all insurance companies that operated in New Jersey limited that liability for all. The fact that reduced taxation in New Jersey might ultimately expose the foreign insurers to greater liability for retaliatory taxes once their liabilities elsewhere were calculated was immaterial. It was not for the court to judge the wisdom of the means adopted by the legislature to reach two valid objectives.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the tank was within the definition of &quot;reservoir,&quot; or, in the alternative, &quot;equipment,&quot; and, therefore, it qualified as an exclusion to &quot;real estate&quot; under the definition of N.J.

The owners claimed the municipality's decision to appeal the property's assessment violated these provisions. Selecting the property for appeal was not the equivalent of assessment and taxation, for purposes of the Uniformity Clause.

The corporation appealed the assessment and while still pending, it filed an amended complaint wherein it abandoned its claim for investment company status and sought a refund of those taxes, contending that it was a financial business corporation (FBC). The trial court found that it had jurisdiction over the matter, in that the argument was not required to be initially presented to the director before being raised in the assessment challenge. The trial court ruled that a refund was barred by the time period for such claims under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:49-14 and that the doctrine of equitable recoupment was not applicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff manufacturer appealed property tax assessments by defendant city on its automobile assembly plant. The city filed counterclaims. The 1983, 1984, and 1985 appeals were before the court upon remand from the Supreme Court of New Jersey, and were consolidated with appeals from 1984-2000. The instant opinion dealt only with the issue of whether certain items of personal property within the plant were subject to local property tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The manufacturer argued that certain personal property was not assessable. The city contended the property was taxable as part of the real property. In reaching its decision as to the taxability of various items, the court often referred to what it called the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; tests, referring to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54:4-1a and 54:4-1b. The court found that the city bore the initial burden of producing evidence that the personal property at issue was affixed, and then there were various factors that shifted the burden between the parties. As an example, certain booths and ovens, including control rooms and platforms, were affixed. The manufacturer overcame the presumption of taxation under the &quot;b&quot; test, creating a presumption that the elements of the &quot;a&quot; test were satisfied. However, the city came back and showed that the customary practices in the industry were that such items were ordinarily intended to be affixed permanently. Therefore, they were taxable. The same was true for make-up air houses. They could not be removed without material injury to the property, and the general practice and intention was for them to remain in place until no longer used. Therefore, they were taxable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, the Director of the Division of Taxation, New Jersey (division), determined that plaintiff estate's computation of tax in its tax return was incorrect because of an additional one percent executor's commission that should not have been claimed as a deduction. The division issued a notice of assessment indicating that taxes of a specified sum were due. The estate appealed. The division moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent's will named two executors. The division disallowed the deduction for the second executor's commission based on N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3B:18-15 (repealed by 2000 N.J. Laws ch. 29, &sect; 2), in effect when the decedent died. That statute gave a court discretion to allow corpus commissions in excess of the commissions to which one fiduciary was entitled under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3B:18-14, at a rate not exceeding one percent of all corpus for each additional fiduciary. The division argued that the repealed statute applied and that the repealed statute indicated that the disallowance was proper because court approval of the additional commission was not obtained. The tax court agreed with the estate's argument that the repeal of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3B:18-15 and an amendment to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3B:18-14 by 2000 N.J. Laws ch. 29, &sect; 1, changed the law to allow the added commission without court approval. The legislative record indicated that 2000 N.J. Laws ch. 29 was curative legislation intended to clarify the two statutes. Therefore, it applied retroactively since there was no manifest injustice in doing so. Under the amended legislation, the estate was entitled to the deduction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The tax court denied the division's motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of the estate, vacating the assessment for additional taxes imposed by the division.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant city granted tax exemptions to defendant senior housing company. Plaintiffs, cities, challenged the validity of the exemptions. The New Jersey Attorney General intervened as a party defendant. The company moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs argued the tax exemptions improperly included an exemption for land taxes in violation of the Limited-Dividend Nonprofit Housing Corporations or Associations Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55:16-1 to 16-22, and its successor, the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:20-1 to 20-20, and other errors. The court held that under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:20-19, the Limited-Dividend Law had to be construed with respect to, and in a manner consistent with, the Long Term Law. The two laws could be interpreted consistently only if N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55:16-18 was read to authorize an exemption for the improvements in connection with a project and not for land. Thus, the ambiguous language of the Limited-Dividend Law, which permitted a tax exemption if a municipal governing body found that the project was or would be an improvement, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55:16-18 had to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Long Term Law as providing a tax exemption for improvements only, and not for land. Consequently, the exemptions did not violate the provisions of the Limited-Dividend Law or Long Term Law, as they were for developments and improvements, not the land itself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a complaint alleging that a spot assessment for the 1997 tax year by defendant municipality in New Jersey was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant municipality's last revaluation was in 1988. The Bergen County Board of Taxation, however, subsequently approved a reassessment plan for 1993, which resulted in the review of 11,209 line items. While construction of the subject improvement was not finished as of the 1993 reassessment, the property ultimately received a $ 4,878,000 assessment upon completion. On October 1, 1996, pursuant to an assessment maintenance plan, the $ 4,878,000 assessment was increased. The issue before the tax court was whether defendant's October 1, 1996 revaluation of the subject property constituted an unconstitutional spot assessment. The tax court found that there was no evidence to indicate that the assessor used any factors other than sales of nursing homes in neighboring municipalities in his determination to increase the subject property's assessment for 1997. The assessor did not utilize the &quot;sale of the subject&quot; factor, because no such sale took place. The tax court found that the assessment levied on taxpayer's property was not an unconstitutional spot assessment.</SPAN></P>

Those circumstances arose in 1987. At that time, another entity, the prior owner who sold the lots to the plaintiff, requested defendant defer action on the lots. The prior owner acquired title to the lots along with adjacent property in 1988 although ownership was still at issue. The prior owner filed tax appeals concerning the property up through 1993 at which time it entered into a settlement with defendant. In 1998, the prior owner conveyed the property to plaintiff. The issue of ownership remained unresolved. The prior owner assigned all rights to erroneously paid taxes. The tax court held plaintiff must show the taxes were mistakenly paid in order to be reimbursed. Since plaintiff or the prior owner knew the ownership of the property was in dispute, they could not argue they mistakenly paid the taxes. Their proper avenue was to appeal the assessed taxes and discern ownership. Defendant was not unfairly enriched as the 1993 settlement also covered the adjacent property taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff appealed a judgment of the Passaic County Board of Taxation (New Jersey), which affirmed a tax assessment on plaintiff's property. Defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that, under the definition of tax delinquency in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-67, plaintiff failed to comply with the tax payment requirements found in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:51A-1(b). Plaintiff moved for a judgment declaring the definition of delinquency unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sold plaintiff's property at a tax sale to a third party for an amount that equaled all outstanding taxes on the property.  N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-67 provided that all outstanding taxes had to be paid before a taxpayer could appeal the assessment. Defendant argued that notwithstanding the amounts received, taxes remained delinquent for tax appeal purposes. Plaintiff argued that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-67 violated substantive and procedural due process provisions of the federal and New Jersey Constitutions. The court held a rational basis existed for the tax sale provisions; therefore, substantive due process was not violated. However, the court held the tax sale provisions violated procedural due process. Once a tax sale certificate was sold to a third party, a tax appeal could only be filed if the property owner redeemed the certificate. Municipalities did not retain any portion of the redemption payment. The court held that mandating such payment as a condition to an appeal violated the root requirement of the Due Process Clause, that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before they were deprived of any significant property interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, and granted plaintiff's motion to declare the tax sale provisions of the statute unconstitutional, as the tax sale provisions violated procedural due process requirements.</SPAN></P>
