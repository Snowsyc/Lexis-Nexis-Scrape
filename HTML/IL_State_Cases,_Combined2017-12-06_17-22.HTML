</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) that dismissed as frivolous and patently without merit a petition for postconviction relief from his convictions of armed robbery and attempted murder of police officers, in which he also challenged the legality of the sentences imposed on him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a co-defendant were both tried on charges arising out of a bar hold-up in the course of which defendant was wounded in a shoot-out with police, but only defendant was convicted. The appellate court reviewed de novo defendant's claims of ineffective trial and appellate counsel, but found that trial counsel was not ineffective in making strategic decisions regarding the calling of witnesses, and that appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise an issue of sufficiency of the evidence where the amount and quality of the evidence against defendant and his co-defendant were quite distinct. At the time defendant was sentenced, however, the sentencing ranges in effect for attempted murder of a police officer had been amended by Ill. Pub. Act 88-680 (effective 1995), which was subsequently held unconstitutional. Even though the sentences imposed on defendant would have been legal under pre-existing law, there was no telling how the change in ranges might have affected his sentences, so they were void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed dismissal of the petition for relief from the convictions, but vacated the sentences imposed on the attempted murder counts, and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicted defendant of home invasion, two counts of armed robbery, and two counts of first degree murder, and sentenced him to concurrent sentences of natural life for the murder counts and concurrent 30-year prison terms for the armed robbery counts. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another barged into the home of the victims, robbed them and shot them. Although the State proceeded under a theory of accountability at trial, defendant was also charged with felony murder. The jury was instructed on felony murder and the prosecutor argued felony murder as an alternative theory. Thus, the appellate court found the evidence sufficient under either theory. Felony murder applied as an alternative theory to accountability because it was charged in the indictment, argued by the State at trial, and included in the jury instructions. Next, the prosecutor did not make improper remarks about the victims' children, misstate the law of accountability, or misstate the evidence. Isolated comments that the victims would miss milestones in their children's lives was not reversible error as they were not a material factor leading to defendant's conviction. Also, the prosecutor was permitted to give examples illustrating the application of the law to the facts, and correctly stated the law. Finally, Apprendi did not apply as, when imposing the natural life sentence, the trial court did not increase the penalty for first degree murder beyond the statutory maximum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Additionally, it was directed that mittimus be corrected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two stolen vehicle crimes. He pled guilty to both charges. He was approved to participate in residential treatment and was placed on probation. He was then arrested on a separate charge of possession of a stolen motor vehicle. Shortly thereafter, the State petitioned for violation of probation and warrant alleging the possession of the stolen motor vehicle charge, failure to report to his probation department, and failure to comply with residential treatment rules. After a hearing, defendant stipulated that he previously had been convicted on two criminal charges. Defendant's probation was then revoked. He was sentenced to time in prison, with credit given to him for time he had already served. After the revocation was ordered, the appellate court found that defendant's prior sentence of probation was not void as the trial court had the discretion to sentence him to probation so he could be treated for drug abuse. It also found the mandatory sentencing scheme allowing for enhanced punishment based on prior convictions was permitted based on a narrow Apprendi exception, and that a remand was required to impose the correct credit for time served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of reckless homicide and two counts of aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) sentenced defendant to a four-year prison term on the reckless homicide convictions and a concurrent three-year term on the aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol convictions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the reckless homicide statute,&nbsp;720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/9-3(b) (West 2000), was unconstitutional because it created a mandatory presumption of recklessness. The appellate court held that the language of &sect; 9-3(b) did not equate to a mandatory presumption of recklessness. Defendant also contended that the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court held that the evidence showing defendant's blood alcohol concentration to be 0.13 three hours after the accident was sufficient to establish that he drove under the influence of alcohol. The appellate court also noted that the evidence was not so unreasonable, improbable, or so unsatisfactory as to warrant a reversal of the reckless homicide conviction. Defendant next argued that the trial court erred in failing to provide an interpreter for a witness. The appellate court held that due process did not require the presence of an interpreter since the witness gave appropriate responses to questions. Finally, as for the alleged violation of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 412(a)(ii), the appellate court held that the issue had been waived by defense counsel's failure to object at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant disability pension recipient sought review in the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) of the decision of appellee pension fund board of trustees terminating her pension.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recipient was granted a nonduty police disability pension. The appellate court held the fact that she had to provide three medical evaluations to be found eligible for a pension, under 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-115 (West 2000), and her pension could be terminated based on one evaluation, under 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-116 (West 2000), did not violate due process, as she had an adequate hearing, or equal protection, as the legislature's treatment of potential disability pensioners and pension recipients was a rational distinction that served the legitimate goal of ensuring the pension fund's integrity. It was unnecessary to construe &sect; 3-116 to require three evaluations, as its language was clear. Exclusion of the recipient's evidence of her mental state was not unconstitutional, as she had an adequate opportunity to offer evidence on this subject. If the exclusion was otherwise error, the error was harmless. The manifest weight of the evidence supported termination of her pension, as the pension board could choose which medical evidence to credit. The physician whose evaluation did not favor the recipient was not biased.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested for prostitution-related offenses after an undercover officer entered the nightclub where they worked and one defendant took money from the officer in exchange for the performance of a private erotic dance by the other defendant, in the course of which the officer's genital area was fondled through clothing. On appeal of their convictions, defendants argued that the statutory definition of prostitution, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11-14(a) (West 2000), was vague and overbroad. The appellate court held that the erotic dancing in question was not protected by the First Amendment, because it went beyond expressive dancing to physical touching. It was not vague, either. It was perfectly clear from the plain language, which prohibited any touching of sex organs for purposes of sexual arousal or gratification, that it reached touching through clothing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to sexual assault and was sentenced to 11 years. The appellate court vacated the judgment and remanded the cause with directions that defendant be sentenced to time served under the Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/1-1 et seq. (West 1996). The Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) sentenced defendant accordingly, but ruled he stood convicted of a criminal offense. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that, when a court entered a disposition under the Act, pursuant to 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 405/5-4(6)(c)(ii), the resultant judgment constituted an adjudication of delinquency under the Act. The State argued &sect; 5-4(6)(c)(ii), pertained only to sentencing and that the minor still stood convicted of a criminal offense. The appellate court concluded that, when the charge or charges enumerated in &sect; 5- 4(6)(a) were resolved in the minor's favor, he or she was no longer excluded from the definition of delinquent minor. Thus, the appellate court concluded, by validating the criminal prosecution and verdict, &sect; 5-4(6)(c)(ii) eliminated the need to retry a defendant in a formal delinquency hearing. The State also argued that, even if defendant was correct on the merits, he forfeited review by failing to file a motion to withdraw his guilty plea in the trial court. The appellate court disagreed, noting that defendant was not convicted of an offense mandating criminal prosecution under &sect; 5-4(6)(a), and therefore the trial court had no statutory authority to enter the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court was modified by entering an adjudication of delinquency. Defendant's conviction for criminal sexual assault was vacated.</SPAN></P>

In reaching the conclusion that defendant's postconviction petition was properly dismissed and that this cause should not have been remanded for defendant to allege a lack of culpable negligence, the court of appeals noted that a cause need not be remanded where defendant has not alleged, in the trial court, a lack of culpable negligence. The court of appeals examined 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122/2.1(a)(2) (West 2000) and found that it provided that the court could dismiss a postconviction petition, if the claims of a defendant, sentenced to imprisonment, were frivolous or patently without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) dismissing his petition for conditional release and granting the State's motion for a finding of no probable cause under the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/1 to 99 (West 2000), after a hearing, and a review of the examinations of defendant by defendant's psychologist and the State's psychologist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's contention that it was plain error to fail to appoint neutral examiners was rejected, as was his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to object to the appointment. A hearing on discharge was not required because the trial court determined there was not probable cause to believe that defendant was no longer a sexually violent person. The procedure employed by the trial court comported with &sect; 65(b)(1) ( 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 207/65(b)(1) (West 2000)) and was not equivalent to entry of summary judgment. Defendant failed to show that it was not substantially probable that he would engage in acts of sexual violence if conditionally released. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that defendant was not entitled to a full hearing on conditional release or discharge. The Act did not violate defendant's right to due process. Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to make a constitutional challenge to the Act lacked merit. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel for failing to ensure that defendant's psychologist filed a timely report, as any error did not prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal, inter alia, that under Apprendi, his consecutive sentences for murder and attempted murder were unconstitutional, and that one of the convictions for armed robbery must be vacated since a criminal defendant could not be convicted of both felony murder and the underlying predicate felony. The appellate court agreed with the trial court's determination that defendant failed to raise the gist of a constitutional claim and thus the trial court properly dismissed his postconviction petition. In addition, the appellate court advised that sentences which ran consecutively to each other were not converted into a single sentence, and because consecutive sentences remained distinct, there was no Apprendi conflict inasmuch as Apprendi only addressed sentences for individual crimes. Therefore, the appellate court found that defendant's sentences did not violate Apprendi. However, the appellate court noted that the State conceded that defendant's conviction and sentence on the armed robbery count was improper and should be vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that he was improperly ticketed for gang or unauthorized organization activity when correctional officers seized an Islam-related pamphlet that condemned all correctional officers. This condemnation included a pledge that was signed by some inmates. The inmate sought a declaration that the employees' actions violated the Illinois Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 775 Ill. Comp. Stat. 35/1 et seq. The appellate court found that the inmate failed to show that the seizure placed a substantial burden on his free exercise of religion. The inmate did not show that possession of the pamphlet was required by the basic tenets of Islam. Furthermore, the Muslim chaplain said that the pamphlet was not condoned or disseminated by his office. Even if the seizure of the pamphlet was a burden on the inmate's practice of Islam, the seizure was lawful, because the pamphlet's inflammatory language could have been construed as a threat to the prison's security. Finally, it was the inmate's burden, not the department's, to submit the pamphlet for approval, or the inmate had to run the risk of being ticketed for possession of it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed from an order of the Cook County Circuit Court denying expungement of the record of his drunk driving conviction. He challenged the constitutionality of two amended statutes that prohibited the expungement of his records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time petitioner was convicted of drunk driving, Illinois statutes permitted him to petition for expungement of his criminal record five years after completing probation. During the five-year waiting period, however, the Illinois legislature enacted Ill. Pub. Act 89-637, which amended both 20 Ill. Comp. Stat. 2630/5 and 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-6-3.1 to preclude expungement in the case of drunk driving convictions. Petitioner argued that these amendments violated the federal and Illinois prohibitions against ex post facto laws contained in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The appellate court held, first, that there was no question that the plain language of the statute prohibited the expungement of petitioner's record. It went on to consider whether the amendments unconstitutionally created a new offense or increased petitioner's punishment. By analogy to constitutional case law involving sex offender registration and notification laws, the appellate court concluded that, even though the ban on expungement was clearly intended to have a deterrent effect, its primary aim was not punitive, but the protection of the public, so it was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order denying relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to an agreement in which the State would recommend four-year concurrent prison sentences, defendant pled guilty to seven counts of forgery in three consolidated cases. The Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County, Illinois, rejected the recommendation, sentenced her to concurrent five-year terms of imprisonment, and ordered her to pay restitution and costs. Her motion to reconsider sentence was denied. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before accepting her plea, the trial judge told defendant that he would not be bound by the State's sentencing recommendation, and that she could receive up to 3 consecutive sentences of 10 years' imprisonment. He did not admonish her that she could be ordered to pay restitution. The State argued the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to hear defendant's appeal, as she failed to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d) by not filing a motion to withdraw her guilty plea. The appellate court disagreed. As the trial judge did not sentence defendant within the terms of the plea agreement, defendant was not obliged to file a motion to withdraw the plea, but properly filed the motion to reconsider the sentence under Rule 604(d). Defendant's untimely filing of her motion to reconsider, in violation of Rule 604(d), did not deprive the appellate court of jurisdiction. As the trial court failed to admonish defendant she could be required to pay restitution, its restitution order was improper. Finally, the order that the department of correction (DOC) withhold 50 percent of defendant's prison wages for court costs was unauthorized by statute and therefore void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated those parts of the order that required defendant to pay restitution and the DOC to withhold 50 percent of the defendant's income to pay restitution and court costs, but affirmed the remainder of the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former public employee of defendant city appealed from an order of the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois), denying his petition for writ of certiorari for review of a decision of defendant personnel board terminating his employment for failure to reside in the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a unionized electrical mechanic at a large regional airport located within the city. Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 2-152-340 (1990) required city employees to live in the city. On a tip, city personnel investigators conducted surveillance both at the city apartment where the employee claimed to live and at the suburban home of his family. The personnel board determined that he violated the ordinance and lied to investigators, and it discharged him. The appellate court upheld the action. Even though the airport in question received funding from federal and airline sources, it was still the city airport, and the residency rule had a rational relationship to the civic welfare, so it was not unconstitutional. Furthermore, the board's determination was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The record did not indicate that the employee was threatened with discharge if he failed to testify, which would have violated the collective bargaining agreement. Finally, the exclusionary rule did not necessarily apply in non-criminal settings. In the instant case, the benefit of excluding the evidence would have outweighed the likely social costs.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that Illinois case law had long established that an indeterminate sentence was to be treated as a life sentence, and that life sentences were well within the statutory range for murder. Thus, defendant's sentences did not expose him to a greater possible punishment than authorized by the jury's verdict, and there had been no Apprendi violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two people bought three lots on a street in Urbana, Illinois, when the lots were zoned for multi-family residential use. Four years later, the city passed an ordinance that changed the zoning on the lots to single family residential use.

The appellate court reviewed the criteria set down by the Supreme Court of Illinois in prior decisions and held that (1) the landowners did not have a right to count on an indefinite continuation of the multi-family residential use zoning classification; (2) because the landowners had not applied for a building permit or made substantial expenditures on their lots, they had no vested interest in the multi-family residential use zoning classification; and (3) although property located within two blocks of the landowners' lots was zoned for multi-family residential use, the city had a valid reason for down-zoning lots on the street where the landowners' lots were located.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court for the 13th Judicial Circuit, Bureau County, Illinois, which convicted him, after he pled guilty, to the unauthorized theft of currency in excess of $ 10,000 but less than $ 100,000. The trial court sentenced defendant to 12 years' imprisonment and ordered him to pay $ 20,000 in restitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims of defendant's crime were 71 and 93 years old. Before defendant entered his plea, the trial judge admonished him of the rights he would forego by pleading guilty. The judge also explained the sentencing range for a Class 2 felony and informed defendant he was eligible for an extended sentence due to the victims' ages. Ordinarily, defendant would have been sentenced according to the Class 2 felony sentencing range of three to seven years with the possibility of probation under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3(b)(1) (1998). However, because of the ages of the victims, he was sentenced pursuant to &sect; 5-5-3.2(b)(4)(ii), which carried a sentencing range of a mandatory 7 to 14 years, with no possibility of probation. The appellate court held the penalties for unauthorized theft and theft by deception similarly violated the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 11, since they required the same elements, yet carried significantly different penalties. Defendant failed to include the issue of the propriety of the restitution order in his motions. Thus, he waived the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's extended term sentence was unconstitutional as applied and was vacated. The penalties for unauthorized theft and theft by deception were unconstitutionally disproportionate. The trial court's restitution order with the suggestion that payment be re-directed was affirmed if appropriate. The matter was remanded for proper sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city and director of revenue, appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff restaurants, where the restaurants claimed that the city's litter tax ordinance, Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 3-43-010 et seq., violated state law, violated Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970), and was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litter tax ordinance, Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 3-43-010 et seq., was passed in an effort to control the amount of litter resulting from carry-out food. The ordinance imposed a tax on the sale of food prepared for immediate consumption by a place for eating, Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 3-43-020 (2000). A place for eating was defined as a business engaged in the sale of food at retail, where the business provided for on-premises consumption of the food it sold, Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 3-43-010(A)(5) (2000). The ordinance exempted food that was not carry-out food, Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 3-43-030(A) (2000).  65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-42-5 (West 1998) authorized the city to tax places for eating. Because the ordinance taxed places for eating under &sect; 11-42-5, the appellate court found it did not violate 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8-11-6a (West 1998). The ordinance violated the uniformity clause, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, as it did not bear a reasonable relationship to its object. It taxed items that were not likely to cause litter, food sold for on-premises consumption, while not taxing other items that were likely to cause litter, food sold by carry-out-only businesses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for making a harassing call. Defendant's motion to dismiss was denied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 2(b)(5) of the Communications Act, codified at 720 Ill. Comp.

I, &sect; 11; the trial court had no statutory authority to order restitution for the parking tickets; and only the court, not the circuit clerk, had authority to impose the fine. The appellate court upheld that the legislature's classification of burglary as a forcible felony since there was a reasonable argument in favor of the classification. The appellate court found no violation of the proportionate penalties clause since the offenses pointed to by defendant were similar and contained many of the same elements, and the language of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-8 (West 2000) included in its definition of forcible felonies a clause to include any felony involving the use or threat of force or violence.

The trial court allowed the prosecutor to argue in closing arguments, and instructed the jury in a modification of the standard instruction, that penetration could occur both by contact or intrusion, but erroneously gave the impression that penetration by contact could occur where an accused's finger touched the child's private parts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A patient sued a medical center and named a doctor who worked as a medical resident at the medical center, but who had since left Illinois and established a medical practice in another state, as a respondent in discovery. The doctor filed a motion to quash the summons that was served on him, arguing that, as he no longer resided in Illinois, the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. The appellate court held that: (1) 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-402 (1998) allowed the patient to name the doctor as a respondent in discovery for the purpose of securing discovery and required the doctor to respond to discovery in the same manner as though he had been named as a defendant; and (2) because the patient's action against the doctor arose from the doctor's employment with the medical center in Illinois, the doctor had sufficient minimum contacts with Illinois to satisfy traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice under the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

This was improper. The trial court's responsibility under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402 was not negated by the fact that defendant had negotiated a plea agreement with the State. Ill. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purchasers sued defendants, auto dealership and collection service, seeking damages in connection with the purchase of a vehicle. Count II of the complaint sought a declaratory judgment that certain provisions of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act were unconstitutional. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered judgment for the dealership on count II, and the purchasers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the 1993 and 1996 amendments, Ill. Pub. Act 87-1140 and Ill. Pub. Act 89-144, to section 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/10a violated Illinois' constitutional prohibition against special legislation.&nbsp;Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 (1970) prohibited legislation which arbitrarily discriminated in favor of a select group. The amendments in question imposed penalties on both consumers and car dealers for refusing to settle cases, and limited the ability of the consumer to receive punitive damages and added a notice requirement. The amendments were urged because the legislature perceived that in cases involving new and used car dealers the availability of punitive damages and awards of attorney fees encouraged consumers to file lawsuits rather than attempting to work out a settlement. The appellate court held that in the present case there was not enough evidence that a perceived crisis existed in the auto dealership industry to require the measures. Moreover, even if the appellate court were to assume that the problem existed, there was no basis for distinguishing between fraud committed by auto dealers and others who defrauded consumers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment granting a dealership's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to count II of the complaint was reversed. The denial of the purchasers' motion for judgment on the pleadings was reversed and remanded to the trial court for the entry of an order granting judgment on the pleadings on count II for the purchasers, and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The circuit court's failure to give any admonishments as to defendant's appellate rights failed both the completeness and the accuracy requirements of due process. When a defendant was not given Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 605(b) admonishments and subsequently failed to file a motion to withdraw his plea of guilty, the cause should be remanded for further proceedings. When a trial judge failed to provide the proper Rule 605(b) admonishments and defendant failed to follow Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d), the cause had to be remanded to the trial court so that defendant could be given the correct admonishments and allowed the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) convicting her, at her second trial, of murdering her boyfriend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant and her brothers were questioned in the murder of her boyfriend, the interrogation took place at Area 2, a police district in Chicago, Illinois, in which officers were later determined to have routinely tortured suspects during the time period in question. At defendant's retrial, she sought to re-open the issue of denial of her motions to suppress evidence, but the appellate court held that the first ruling was the law of the case, because it was clear that the original judge had considered all the constitutional issues that defendant sought to raise in her second attempt. Subpoenas regarding incidences of torture in Area 2 were properly quashed, because defendant had never raised the issue of her brothers' torture before, and never claimed that she had been tortured. Since defendant failed to lay a foundation regarding the medical records indicating that the victim had abused her, they could not have been admitted in evidence or taken into the jury room. Since defendant's appeal was heard in an appellate district that applied the Apprendi rule to extended term sentences for heinous or brutal crimes, her 80-year sentence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction, but vacated defendant's sentence and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The right to bear arms was not fundamental, so the correct due process analysis of the ordinance was the rational basis test, and it was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest in regulating firearms and lawfully applied to property lent by an innocent owner to an unlawful user. When the unregistered shotgun entered the city, it was contraband per se, subject to confiscation and destruction. The ordinance appropriately exempted non-resident owners, and its definition of antique firearms was neither arbitrary nor capricious. It clearly stated when the shotgun had to be registered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), in separate trials, convicted defendants of criminal drug conspiracy, 750 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the trial court erred in summarily granting the State's motion for substitution of a judge and other errors. Defendants maintained that the judge to which the case was initially assigned mistakenly believed that it had no choice but to grant the motion and failed to realize its authority to inquire into the actual grounds for the motion. Defendants argued that, because the State's motion was prompted by the original judge's willingness to entertain a defense motion for a bond reduction, the motion should not have been granted. The appellate court held that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/114-5(a) allowed the State to move for substitution of a judge without inquiry by the court. The one exception to this rule was where it appeared that such motions were being used to thwart the chief judge of a circuit court's exercise of independent assignment authority. Defendants did not allege that the prosecution employed such a tactic. The appellate court further held the original judge's indication that he intended to hear a motion to reduce bond was not a substantial ruling that would have precluded the State from exercising its right to automatic substitution of judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, sustained 5 of 25 objections filed by appellee taxpayers challenging the legality of certain property taxes levied by the appellant city. The city appealed the trial court's order and the taxpayers cross-appealed the pretrial dismissal of one of their objections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city contested, inter alia, the trial court's ruling on two objections which claimed that the city (1) unlawfully underestimated revenue for the library maintenance and operation fund; and (2) overestimated the loss in collections for the debt service funds and the public building commission fund. The appellate court held that the transcript showed that the trial court sustained the objection regarding the library maintenance fund based on a pattern of historical underestimation. However, no testimony showed that the city had certainty in regard to the estimate prior to the 1989 appropriations ordinance, and the objection could not be sustained, and while there was testimony that the city had used a five percent estimate for loss of collections for decades, the record showed that the city had relied on financial reports and estimated a rate consistent with the rates shown therein. The increases in second year collections were insufficient to sustain a tax objection. The trial court also erred in dismissing the taxpayers' objection that the city illegally diverted surplus funds for another purpose, because material questions of fact remained regarding the objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That part of the trial court's judgment which sustained the objections as to the underestimation of revenue and overestimation of the loss in collections, and which dismissed the objection as to illegal diversion of funds, was reversed. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, securities salesmen and securities dealer, moved the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois) to quash subpoenas by appellant state securities department for the production of personal banking information of the salesmen. The department moved to enforce the subpoenas. The trial court granted appellees' motion and denied that of the department, and the department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department said it needed the salesmen's personal banking information as their office kept no &quot;business&quot; account into which their commissions were deposited before disbursement to them. The appellate court held the salesmen were not required by 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/8(I)(1), (I)(3) (West 2000), or Ill. Admin. Code tit. 14, &sect; 130.825(c)(1) (2000) to preserve personal banking information, nor did 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/11(D)(1) (West 2000) allow the department to audit such information from them. The documents the department sought were irrelevant to a routine audit. In balancing the department's need for official intrusion, under the Securities Law, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1 et seq., against the salesmen's constitutionally protected interests, the subpoenas violated the salesmen's privacy rights, absent an indicia of fraud. Some bank accounts were held jointly with spouses. Some information sought was available from the dealer's home office, but the department did not seek the information there. Creating a &quot;business&quot; account at the salesmen's office would not lessen an opportunity for fraud or provide greater information to the department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent convicted sex offender appealed from a judgment of the Lake County Circuit Court (Illinois) granting the State's petition, pursuant to the Illinois Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/1 et seq., to commit the offender to the custody of a state agency, after a jury determined that he was likely to re-offend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over the years, the offender had been convicted of several sex offenses against children, most of them involving his young daughter. Although the State of Illinois had not initially petitioned for his classification as a sexually violent person subject to commitment when the offender was first eligible for mandatory supervised release, it filed a petition when his release was revoked for further molestations. The appellate court held that the petition was timely, because the 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/15(b)(2) time limit for filing a petition did not specify a particular release date as the single date near which a petition had to be filed. That court also held that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/25(e), which provided for appointment of a medical expert for an indigent sex offender, did not violate the offender's due process guarantees, even though the State had the resources to pay many experts. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the offender's prior sex offenses, because it was critical to the jury's determination of whether he was likely to re-offend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance and narcotics racketeering, for which he was sentenced to concurrent terms of 30 years' imprisonment, was affirmed on appeal, defendant petitioned the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois) to reduce his sentence. The trial court denied his petition, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his sentence more than six years after he was sentenced. The appellate court held the State waived the issue of timeliness by not raising it in the trial court. The statutory elements of his narcotics racketeering conviction were implicitly contained in his unlawful-delivery-of-cocaine convictions, rendering the unlawful-delivery-of-cocaine counts lesser-included offenses. His convictions of, and sentences for, unlawful delivery of a controlled substance had to be vacated, and his counsel was ineffective for not raising the issue in his petition to reduce his sentence, under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1401 (West 1998), as he would have prevailed on the issue. Defendant could not show he was prejudiced by counsel's failure to raise the trial court's failure to state the basis for his extended term sentence for narcotics racketeering, and there was a basis in the record for finding an aggravating factor justifying defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and sentences for unlawful delivery of cocaine were vacated. His conviction and sentence for narcotics racketeering were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of Winnebago County, Illinois, convicted defendant of first-degree murder. The trial court sentenced him to 80 years' imprisonment, and denied his motion to reconsider his sentence. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant quarreled with, then fatally shot, the victim. In imposing extended-term sentencing, the trial court noted his substantial criminal history, the execution-style manner in which he shot the helpless and wounded victim in the back of the head, and found &quot;brutal and heinous&quot; behavior indicative of wanton cruelty. Defendant claimed that prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel deprived him of a fair trial. The instant court held that as the prosecutor's remarks were reasonable inferences based on the evidence, defendant suffered no prejudice. Defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different had defense counsel objected to any comments made during the prosecutor's closing argument. The trial court's &quot;brutal or heinous&quot; finding did not create a new or independent crime, but was merely an aggravating circumstance. Since defendant's sentence was not beyond the maximum authorized by statute, there was no &quot;sentence enhancement,&quot; and defendant's Apprendi claim failed. In imposing sentence, the trial court considered the statutory factors, and the instant court would not disturb the sentence.</SPAN></P>

The officer stopped defendant and asked if he had any illegal substances and defendant handed over a bag of crack cocaine.

Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence because it was obtained in an illegal seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress because despite the fact that the officer had observed defendant's behavior for two to three days and knew the area to be a high drug-trafficking area, circumstances were not sufficient to make a Terry stop. Because the only evidence of defendant's crime was to be suppressed, the court reversed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) arising from breach of contract claims brought by three plaintiff faculty members against defendant college, two faculty members argued on appeal that the dismissal of their declaratory judgment action was in error. The third faculty member challenged the denial of her motion in the original chancery action for additional relief under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-701(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found the two faculty members were entitled to future damages under Illinois law, but the issue was not solely resolvable through a declaratory judgment. The court could not make a finding on the effect of another case on the claims for damages unless and until the issue was raised by the college. Whether the faculty members were entitled to posttrial damages did not turn solely on an interpretation of the other case, but on an analysis of the rule that damages for breach of contract beyond the date of trial were barred as speculative. The term &quot;future damages&quot; was imprecise.  735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-701(c) empowered the trial court to assess money damages based on the trial court's earlier declaration that a defendant breached the tenure contract. The third faculty member's motion for additional relief under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-701(c) was compensable in a traditional action at law, as the faculty member had more than one remedy, and selecting one of them was not a bar to another remedy as the remedies were not inconsistent and the other party materially changed position in reliance on the manifestation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cases were reversed and remanded with directions that they be transferred to the law division.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant previously convicted of burglary appealed from an order of the Winnebago County Circuit Court (Illinois) denying his 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-4.1 petition for a new sentencing hearing. On appeal, he also sought relief from the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was not present when he was convicted of burglary and sentenced as a prior felon, pursuant to former 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-3(c)(8). He originally sought relief from his sentence and the underlying conviction on grounds that he was unavailable, within the meaning of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-4.1, arguing that he was incarcerated in Indiana, was incapacitated by substance abuse problems, and was terminally ill. The trial court denied the petition. Although defendant had not originally raised the constitutional issue he raised on appeal, whether the sentencing statute violated the proportional penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, the appellate court proceeded to consider the appeal on the merits and found the statute constitutional. Defendant argued that by including two different classes of felony convictions as enhancing factors, the statute risked punishing less serious offenses more harshly than more serious offenses, but the court held that, if the clause applied at all to groups of offenses, the worst the statute did was treat two types of felonies equally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a veteran grant after he received a general discharge, under honorable conditions, from the United States Navy due to, among other things, his refusal to take an anthrax vaccine. On appeal from the denial of his application, the applicant argued that the trial court erroneously upheld the commission's determination that he was ineligible for an Illinois veteran grant because he was not honorably discharged. The appellate court agreed with the commission that 110 Ill. Comp. Stat. 947/40 (1998) did not permit the applicant to receive an Illinois veteran grant because his discharge was other than honorable. The appellate court noted that 32 C.F.R. &sect; 724.109(a) (2002), distinguished honorable discharge from general discharges, and that the language of 110 Ill. Comp. Stat. 947/40 (1998) was clear in stating that an applicant must have received an honorable discharge in order to be eligible for the Illinois veteran grant. As for the applicant's argument that the court should have considered the reason underlying his discharge, the appellate court held that it was not the court's function to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant's father helped the applicant obtain a social security number when the applicant was very young.

Ann. 5/6-106(b) (West 1998), except his social security number. Based on that statutory section and an administrative rule promulgated by the secretary of state, Ill. Admin Code tit. 92, &sect; 1030.63, he requested relief from having to submit his social security number based on the religious beliefs he had developed. The secretary of state issued a final decision that denied his application after it was determined that neither the statute nor the rule allowed him to obtain a license without providing that number. The trial court affirmed. After it did so, the appellate court found neither the statute nor administrative rule violated his state or federal constitutional rights to free exercise of his religion. It found the statute and rule were neutral laws generally applicable to all driver's license applicants and only incidentally affected his particular religious practices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed from a judgment of the Champaign County Circuit Court (Illinois) that dismissed their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 complaint against defendants, the village and local officials, for alleged Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations in towing a van from their driveway under a nuisance ordinance dealing with inoperable motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village's ordinance, aimed at preventing the nuisance of inoperable motor vehicles stored indefinitely in plain sight on private property, provided for a system of notice and hearing before a vehicle could be towed pursuant to the ordinance. The property owners were repairing the brakes on a van used in their contracting business when they received a notice under the ordinance. They explained the situation, received an extension, and fixed the van before the deadline. Nonetheless, at the direction of certain officials, deputies entered their property and towed the van. When it was retrieved from the impoundment facility, the owners' tools were missing. The appellate court held that for purposes of federal civil rights liability, the owners did not state a claim against the village, since the ordinance as written was proper, or against the sheriff or the mayor, since they were not individually involved, but that the individual officials who decided to tow the van could be liable for Fourth Amendment violations, since there was a warrantless seizure from the curtilage of the home, although not for Fourteenth Amendment notice violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal as to the action against the village and against certain officials in their official capacities, and as to all the Fourteenth Amendment claims, but reversed it as to the Fourth Amendment claims against those officials sued as individuals, and remanded the matter for further proceedings on those claims.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 207/65(b)(1), from being present at the probable cause hearing conducted to determine if facts existed to warrant a hearing on the issue of whether he remained a sexually violent person. The appellate court held, while 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/55(a) provided the trial court &quot;may&quot; appoint a qualified expert to examine the inmate, at the time of his reexamination, that was subject to the rights conferred in 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/25(e) to have such an expert appointed upon request. Under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, the inmate had to be allowed to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. The probable cause hearing held under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/65(b)(1) was such a meaningful time, but disallowing the inmate's presence at that hearing, where he could only be present by counsel, was not a meaningful manner, for due process purposes, and the provision of &sect; 65(b)(1) prohibiting the inmate's personal presence at the hearing was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff school principal appealed from that part of a judgment of the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) that dismissed her petition for administrative review of a decision of defendant school board and its superintendent, terminating her employment for cause. She argued that the decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the statute under which the board acted, 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/34-85, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A school principal somehow accessed confidential test scores of children in surrounding schools, and invited them to apply to her school's magnet program. This caused friction and scandal. She took adverse employment action against teachers who cooperated with the investigation. Although her local school council continued to support her, her contract was terminated by the school board after a hearing. The appellate court reviewed the board's action, rather than the trial court's affirmance of the action, and upheld it. There was ample evidence in the record supporting the impropriety of the principal's conduct and her knowledge that the conduct was wrong; therefore, it fell within the exception in 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/34-85 that permitted the board to find her conduct irremediable, and therefore a firing offense, because she knew all along that it was wrong. Because the statutory procedure provided the principal with notice and an opportunity to explain herself (which she failed to do), it did not violate the due process guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff consumer filed an action against defendant car manufacturer alleging breach of written limited warranty and breach of merchantability under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2301 et seq. The Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) granted the car manufacturer partial summary judgment on the breach of warranty count. The consumer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant action arose after a vehicle purchased by the consumer failed to be properly repaired after being brought in for repairs on 14 occasions. On appeal, the consumer argued that the Act did not permit the car manufacturer to require the return of the vehicle as a condition to any remedy for a breach of the express warranty. She further argued that, although the warranty limited her potential remedies to the repair or replacement of defective parts, the limitation was ineffective because it was inconspicuous and the exclusive remedy failed of its essential purpose. Therefore, the consumer contended, incidental and consequential damages were available as a remedy. The appellate court concluded that the new vehicle limited warranty was not a full warranty under the Act because it did not permit the consumer to elect a replacement of the vehicle or a refund as a remedy for a warranty breach. Therefore, the car manufacturer could not demand the return of the vehicle. Finally, the appellate court noted that summary judgment was erroneously granted on the express warranty count because a factual question existed as to whether the consumer received the benefit of her bargain.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the statute was an unconstitutional limitation of his freedom of speech and that territorial jurisdiction was absent because the solicitation took place via computer, from California.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was located in California when, believing himself to be communicating with a 15-year-old girl in Illinois via the Internet, he solicited sex with her. He was actually corresponding with a middle-aged sheriff's deputy. Defendant was arrested when he arrived in Illinois with the announced intent of consummating the relationship, and was convicted of soliciting sex with a child. He attacked the constitutionality of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-6, but the appellate court upheld the statute as a reasonable limitation on defendant's freedom of expression, given the State's obligation to protect children. It noted, further, that defendant would never have been arrested if he had not acted on the plan he had proposed. An actual child did not have to be involved in order to commit the crime of solicitation, but someone had to be solicited. The fact that the target was in Illinois was sufficient to give Illinois courts territorial jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner police officers or firefighters appealed from a Circuit Court of Rock Island County (Illinois) affirmation of the decision of appellee industrial commission that it had no jurisdiction over their claims under 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/22-307 and dismissal of their causes of action. Respondent city cross-appealed from the portion of the trial court's order reversing the commission's order as to one petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found the commission did not err in finding that it had no jurisdiction. The version of 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/22-307 in effect at the time of the petitioners' injuries was unambiguous that an injured firefighter or police officer could not pursue any common law or statutory remedies against his municipal employer except for those provided by ordinance enacted pursuant to 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/22-306. Petitioners had misplaced reliance on the city's jurisdiction stipulation in the case of one petitioner, and it was of no benefit. Review of the amendment of 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/22-307 revealed nothing to indicate an express intent on the part of the legislature that previously barred claims be revived. The contested laws were not unconstitutional. The trial court ruled that, in the case of one petitioner, the city had made a knowing and binding election to proceed under the Workers' Compensation Act (Act), 820 Ill. Comp. Stat. 305/1 et seq. The city's actions could not confer subject matter jurisdiction where it was absent. The trial court erred in entering judgment on the one petitioner's behalf.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property was downzoned by its inclusion in a special district. The appellate court held the applicable level of scrutiny in his facial challenge to the zoning ordinance was whether the legislation bore a substantial relationship to the public health, safety or welfare or was arbitrary, irrational and capricious. The owner's allegations that (1) the district was a hodgepodge of zoning uses surrounded by commercial uses; (2) his property values were substantially diminished; (3) the rezoning did not benefit the general health, safety or morals; (4) an extreme hardship was imposed on him due to an uncompensated taking of his property; and (5) the subject property had been zoned &quot;as is&quot; for over 40 years, adequately pled a constitutional violation. The owner also adequately alleged improper spot zoning. The city's alleged failure to follow the special district amendment could not be reviewed. On remand, the owner had to give notice to all property owners within 250 feet of the district. He did not have to exhaust local remedies as he sought to invalidate the entire special district.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois), denied defendant's motion for postconviction relief in a case where he was convicted following a bench trial of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, and armed violence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A woman was sitting in her car with her three-year-old son, her father, and her brother. She saw defendant &quot;throw gang signs&quot; at her. The woman started to drive away. Defendant fired a gun. The son was shot in the back of the head and soon died. The father was shot twice in the arm and had to be hospitalized for three days. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder for the killing and attempted first-degree murder for the wounding. The trial court imposed an extended-term sentence for the first-degree murder and a consecutive sentence for the attempted first-degree murder. Defendant's convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. After his postconviction relief petition was denied, the appellate court found the extended-term and consecutive sentences were properly imposed. It found any violation of Apprendi was harmless because no dispute existed but that the murder victim was three years old and the jury would have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt even had it been asked to determine the victim's age. It also found the attempted first-degree murder allowed for consecutive sentencing pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a) (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments imposing extended-term and consecutive sentences were affirmed. Also, the State's request for costs in defending the appeal was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued his conviction must be reversed because 1998 Ill. Laws 1307, violated the single subject clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d). Defendant argued that 1998 Ill. Laws 1307, included unrelated subjects such as the insanity defense and drug asset forfeiture proceedings. The appellate court held that the purported subject of 1998 Ill. Laws 1307, on involving the criminal law, was a legitimate subject for single subject purposes. Defendant also argued the amendments to the Illinois Drug Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act were not related to criminal law, and thus, the single subject clause was thereby violated. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating any of the provisions of 1998 Ill. Laws 1307, bear no natural and logical connection to the single subject relating to the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-3.2(a)(2) provided a person of ordinary intelligence with a reasonable opportunity to distinguish between lawful and unlawful conduct so that he or she could act accordingly.  720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-3.2(a)(2) provided defendant with sufficient notice that his conduct was prohibited.  720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-3.2(a)(2) was constitutional as applied to defendant. The conduct prohibited by 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-3.2(a)(2) was not protected by the First Amendment. The overbreadth doctrine only applied when First Amendment expressive rights were implicated. Since the statute at bar did not infringe on a constitutionally protected right, it was not unconstitutionally broad. After reviewing defendant's wife's testimony, the trial court could have concluded that defendant was guilty of domestic battery. The issue of whether the trial court erred when it entered and continued the order of protection was moot, as defendant was granted supervised visitation. There was no error that denied defendant a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal from judgments of the Du Page County Circuit Court (Illinois), defendant appealed from her natural life sentence imposed pursuant to her guilty plea to first-degree murder and from denial of her motion to dismiss, on double jeopardy grounds, her prosecution for an earlier attempted murder of the same victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant faced charges of attempted first-degree murder of her husband and first-degree murder of him, which occurred a few months after the attempt. In a plea bargain to avoid the death penalty she pled guilty to first-degree murder, but specifically did not plead to the facts underlying the attempt charge. The sentencing court found that the murder was aggravated by its heinousness and brutality, and sentenced defendant to natural life in prison pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-1(a)(1)(b). The appellate court held that the sentence did not violate the rule of Apprendi because by her agreement to a natural life sentence at the plea colloquy, a natural life term became the statutory maximum sentence. Defendant also argued her continuing prosecution for attempted murder violated her double jeopardy guarantees, but the appellate court held that jeopardy had never attached on that charge, because counsel explicitly excluded the factual basis for that charge from defendant's guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners sued defendant village, seeking a declaratory judgment that a village ordinance assessing developmental impact fees for school construction was not authorized by statute and was unconstitutional. The Circuit Court of Kendall County, Illinois, granted summary judgment for the village. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance authorized the village to impose school impact fees on new development within the village. Before they could receive a permit to build a home on their property, the owners were obliged to pay almost $ 4,000 in impact fees. Their suit alleged that the ordinance was authorized by neither the Illinois Constitution nor state statute, that it violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions, and that was an uncompensated &quot;taking&quot; in violation of the federal and state constitutions. The appellate court held that authorization, if any, for the ordinance was provided by 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-12-5 (2000). Under that statute, a municipality could implement a comprehensive plan for the municipality's future development. But that statute was concerned with such traditional planning concepts as the location, width, course, and surfacing of public streets and the size of lots to be used for residential purposes. It could not be read to also authorize a municipality to collect revenue to undertake massive capital improvements. As the ordinance was not authorized by state statute, the appellate court did not reach the constitutional arguments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of Kane County, Illinois, found defendant guilty of first-degree murder; he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's accomplice testified that while he and defendant were burglarizing a home he heard a shot and saw the bleeding victim, and that defendant told him his gun had jammed and ordered him to shoot the victim again, which he did. He admitted to being addicted to several drugs, and to the leniency shown him by the State for his testimony. The appellate court held that as the testimony was in part corroborated by other evidence, including one of the murder weapons found in defendant's possession, the evidence was sufficient to convict. The trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant to question the venire about their experiences with friends or family suffering from substance abuse, as it did not prohibit him from questioning them about their views regarding alcohol and drugs. However, the life sentence was invalid under Apprendi. Since the maximum statutory penalty for first-degree murder was 60 years' imprisonment, and the State conceded that there was insufficient evidence to find defendant eligible for the death penalty, in order to obtain a life sentence the State was obliged to prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt the factors of brutality and heinousness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, but the cause was remanded for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his commitment by the Circuit Court of Champaign County (Illinois) after he was found to be a sexually dangerous person pursuant to Illinois' Sexually Dangerous Persons Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 205/0.01 through 12 (2000). Defendant asserted several errors including constitutionality of the Act and juror instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two psychiatrists diagnosed defendant as suffering from a number of mental disorders, including pedophilia and voyeurism with a history of exhibitionism. Both agreed that defendant was a sexually dangerous person with a propensity for committing acts of sexual assault against children. Two police officers stated defendant admitted committing the underlying crimes, as well as confessing a number of other sex-related offenses over a period of several years. The appellate court held the nature of defendant's psychiatric diagnosis, and the severity of the mental abnormality itself, was sufficient to distinguish defendant from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case. There was no issue as to whether defendant committed as least one act of or attempt at sexual assault or sexual molestation. Defendant's remaining contentions were without merit. In particular, his proposed instruction was a misstatement of the law. He was allowed to cross-examine the testifying psychiatrist concerning whether he would commit sex-related acts in the future. The prior acts showed his propensity to commit criminal acts in pursuit of his sexual urges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Du Page County Circuit Court convicting him, after a trial to the bench, of unlawful contact with a gang member in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/25-1.1. He argued on appeal that the statute was unconstitutional and that the evidence was insufficient to convict him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant pled guilty to a drug offense, a condition of his supervision was that he have no contact with several named persons or any other known gang members. Two days later a police gang specialist saw him with one of the named persons and another gang member, so he was prosecuted for knowingly having contact with gang members while under a sentencing order forbidding it, in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/25-1.1. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute, but the appeals court agreed that it was neither overbroad, because it limited defendant's freedom of association only to the extent of illegal association, nor vague, because it was clear exactly what conduct was prohibited, and the statute contained a scienter element. Defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence that the association to which the prohibited persons belonged was a street gang, but the court held that the trial court, as trier of fact, reasonably relied on the expert evidence of the police gang specialist.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of aggravated criminal sexual assault and other crimes. On direct appeal, the appellate court affirmed. Defendant filed a petition pursuant to the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. The trial court dismissed the petition, and defendant appealed. The appellate court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part. The Illinois Supreme Court directed the appellate court to vacate and reconsider the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the dismissal was erroneous because he stated valid claims that: (1) he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel; and (2) his conviction of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child was void because the statute creating the offense was unconstitutional. The State confessed error on the second issue. Defendant asked the appellate court to reverse the summary dismissal of his petition and remand the cause so that the trial court may appoint counsel for defendant and conduct further proceedings on the petition as a whole, including his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective. The appellate court held that partial summary dismissals were not permitted under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. The Act spoke solely in terms of the petition itself being frivolous or patently without merit, and the Act mandated that if the petition was not dismissed, then the trial court was required to order the petition docketed. The appellate court held this doctrine required the entire petition to be advanced to the second stage of the postconviction process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction of predatory criminal sexual assault was vacated, and the denial of postconviction relief was reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cigar company filed a four-count complaint challenging the validity of the Tobacco Products Act of 1995, 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 143/10-1 et seq. Defendants, the state department of revenue and its director and the state treasurer, filed a motion for summary judgment. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted the motion and upheld the constitutionality of the Act. The company appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act imposed a tax on tobacco products other than cigarettes, such as cigars, and allocated the revenues to the Illinois Long-Term Care Provider Fund, 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 143/10-10. The appellate court held the Act did not violate the due process clauses of the Illinois and federal Constitutions. The appellate court found the Act met the rational basis test. The State had a legitimate interest in preserving the health of its citizens. The Act's taxation of tobacco products was rationally related to those interests, as the Illinois General Assembly could have believed that cigars and other tobacco products caused any number of health problems and that those problems required care in long-term health care facilities. The appellate court held it was rational to formulate a tax requiring people who imposed costs on society to pay some of those costs. The appellate court held the Act did not violate Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2. The fact the tax was imposed specifically to fund nursing home care for the poor did not violate uniformity requirements, as the general assembly could fairly have found a connection between tobacco products and long-term care for the poor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Sangamon County (Illinois), denied plaintiff foreign companies' motion to reconsider and entered judgment dismissing their consolidated complaints for administrative review that they filed after defendants, state insurance agency, director, and counsel, notified the foreign companies that the director had no statutory authority to allow refunds of privilege taxes the foreign companies had paid. The foreign companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foreign companies were incorporated under the laws of states other than Illinois. As foreign companies, they were subject to an annual tax of two percent of net taxable premium income, imposed by 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/409 (1996), for the privilege of doing business in Illinois. However, the state supreme court found that statute was unconstitutional. The foreign companies relied on that holding and the tax refund statute of 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/412(1) (1996) to request refunds of privilege taxes paid over the refund period allowed in &sect; 5/412(1), six years. The state insurance agency, director, and counsel notified them that the director had no statutory authority to allow the refunds. After the trial court denied administrative review, the appellate court found the foreign companies relied on &sect; 5/412(1)'s provision that a refund was permitted where the director erroneously interpreted a statute to collect a tax. However, it found the fact that a statute was found unconstitutional did not mean it had been erroneously interpreted. It also found the foreign companies' due process rights were not violated by an unconstitutional &quot;bait and switch.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated criminal sexual abuse and two counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. Pursuant to a fully-negotiated agreement, defendant pled guilty to aggravated criminal sexual abuse and one count of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child. The other predatory criminal sexual assault count was dismissed. Prior to accepting defendant's guilty pleas, the trial court informed defendant of the nature of the charges against him and the possible penalties provided by law. It did not admonish him that he was subject, when his sentences expired, to civil commitment proceedings under the Sexually Dangerous Persons Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 205/0.01 et seq. (1998), and the Sexually Violent Persons Commitment Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 207/1 et seq. (1998). After defendant's pleas were accepted and he was sentenced in part under an amended truth-in-sentencing law, the appellate court found civil commitment under the named acts was a collateral consequence of defendant's guilty pleas about which the trial court was not required to admonish the defendant. It also found the amended truth-in-sentencing law was not constitutionally defective.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to appellee grandmother's petition for letters of administration, the circuit court appointed her administrator and directed the letters be issued. The grandmother petitioned for an order allowing her to execute settlement documents and distribute to heirs at law. The Circuit Court for the 10th Judicial Circuit, Putnam County, Illinois, denied appellant father's petition to revoke the letters. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose after the death of the father's unborn illegitimate child. On appeal, the father argued the trial court erred in determining that he had no interest, standing, or priority to request removal of the grandmother as administrator of the child's estate. The appellate court concluded that under 755 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-3 (1998), the father, a biological parent, had preference over the grandmother for letters of administration. The grandmother argued, however, that the father was not an eligible parent. The appellate court held that the father was an eligible parent after determining that he resided with the mother before and throughout the pregnancy, provided financial and emotion support to the mother, and, through her, to the unborn child, and held himself out as the father. The court also noted that the right to bring the wrongful death action was not the grandmother's right, but that the action could have been brought by the child's father. Thus, the court held that a determination had to be made as to whether the father was the biological father of the child, with such a right.</SPAN></P>

The mother had not carried her burden of clearly establishing that the statute violated Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, the Illinois Equal Protection Clause.  750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 50/1(D)(t) provided a narrowly tailored means of identifying parents who pose a danger to their children's health and safety. The statute was narrowly tailored to meet the compelling state interest of protecting a child from abuse and the legislature used the least restrictive means consistent with the attainment of its goal. Mother had not carried her burden of clearly establishing a due process violation under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From the Circuit Court of Cook County, plaintiff mother filed this medical malpractice action seeking recovery of damages for the death of her infant son. The court granted defendant doctor's motion to certify a question of law for interlocutory appeal regarding the discoverability of mother's prenatal care records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that a medical malpractice defendant was entitled to obtain medical records pertaining to the prenatal care rendered to decedent's mother during the term of her pregnancy with decedent, despite the mother's invocation of the physician-patient privilege and a right to privacy, where: (1) the mother was both the plaintiff who filed the wrongful death cause of action on behalf of the decedent's estate and a beneficiary to the decedent's estate; and (2) where the decedent's death was alleged to have resulted 16 days after the decedent's birth, as a result of doctor's allegedly negligent care rendered in the first three days of the decedent's life. Filing a medical malpractice lawsuit on behalf of a child waived the physician-patient privilege for records when the child was in utero. A mother's medical records for the period when the infant plaintiff was in utero were discoverable. Here, once mother's child's medical condition was placed at issue in the lawsuit, the physician-patient privilege was waived, as to his prenatal medical records, or, in other words, to the only relevant existing medical records, those pertaining to mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered a final judgment of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of two counts of reckless homicide and one count of driving on a revoked license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's speeding car hit the back of another car. That car then blew up, killing the driver. A police officer spoke with defendant and noticed signs he was under the influence of alcohol. A sample of his blood showed his blood-alcohol concentration exceeded .10 percent. The trial court gave a jury instruction stating that if the jury found defendant's blood alcohol level was .10 percent or more, it could presume, but was not required to presume, that defendant was under the influence of alcohol. After defendant was convicted of reckless homicide for operating a vehicle with a blood-alcohol level of .10 percent or more and operating a vehicle while impaired, the appellate court found the statute under which the jury instruction was given, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-3(c) (1996), was not unconstitutional. It found the statute did not contain an impermissible mandatory presumption, but allowed the jury to presume a defendant with a .10 percent or more blood alcohol level was under the influence. It also found photographic evidence was admissible to show the cause of death, but further found that one of the two convictions had to be vacated since only one death occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction for reckless homicide based on defendant operating a motor vehicle in a reckless manner was vacated, but the judgment of conviction for reckless homicide based on an excessive blood alcohol concentration as defined by statutory law was affirmed. The remainder of the trial court's judgment and the resulting sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He challenged the statutory penalties on constitutional grounds and his own sentence as an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's long-past sex offense conviction made him subject to the reporting requirements of the Illinois Sex Offender Registration Act, at 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 150/6, when he was arrested for something else. The law imposed a two-year reporting requirement on him, but he forgot to report an address change when he moved in temporarily with a neighbor. The appeals court held that the penalty provisions of the statute, codified at 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 150/10, did not violate the due process guarantee of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, the guarantee against double jeopardy, or the proportionate sentences guarantee of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, because the penalties related closely to the statutory purpose. The four-year enhanced-term sentence imposed on defendant was an abuse of discretion, however, because it was manifestly unjust in the circumstances of his offense, and he should also have been required to pay a mandatory $ 500 fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the penalty to shorten defendant's sentence and impose a mandatory fine, and affirmed the remainder of the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment and order of the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) finding him guilty after a bench trial of criminal trespass in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/21-3 and sentencing him to a year of supervision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his neighbor had a tense relationship before he wrote to an Illinois state licensing agency to complain that the neighbor's wife was conducting an illegal day care center on their premises. The neighbor claimed to have warned defendant to stay off the property. Defendant received a response to his letter to the licensing agency, and, while standing in the neighbor's driveway, sought to show it to the neighbor, who refused to speak to him. When the empty envelope fell or blew onto the neighbor's lawn and defendant sought to retrieve it, the neighbor initiated a criminal trespass complaint. The appeals court held that the various subsections of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/21-3 simply explained various ways criminal trespass could occur, so no one subsection had to be identified in the indictment. The evidence did not support defendant's 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/21-3(f) defense of entry for emergency purposes, because an empty envelope was not valuable property and defendant had other ways of saving it. Furthermore, defendant was already wrongfully on the property, in the driveway.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) found defendant guilty of first degree murder. The trial court imposed an extended-term sentence. Defendant appealed the conviction and the sentence imposed. The appeal was initially dismissed for want of prosecution. Defendant moved for post-conviction relief, which was denied. The appellate court vacated the dismissal of the direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held the trial court did not err in declining to give a jury instruction on second degree murder. Defendant had the burden of proving there was at least some evidence of serious provocation. The provocation had to be proportionate to the manner in which the accused retaliated. There was evidence that the victim drove his car across the center line to ram the front of defendant's car. Defendant said that in response he grabbed a jack and ran to the victim's car, where he found the victim lying unresponsive. He dragged the victim from the car and struck his head with such force that he fractured the base of the victim's skull. The appellate court held the response was disproportionate. However, the appellate court held the trial court erred in sentencing defendant. The jury's verdict, without any additional finding of fact, authorized the trial court to sentence defendant to a term of between 20 and 60 years in prison. The appellate court held the sentence imposed deprived defendant of the right to a jury determination of a fact crucial for setting the range of appropriate sentences the trial court had the authority to impose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court modified the sentence to a term of 60 years, and the judgment was affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A single incident gave rise to defendant's convictions of felony murder, armed robbery on which the felony murder conviction was predicated, and attempted murder.

Since he did not file within that time, his petition was properly dismissed without a hearing. The appeals court nonetheless considered the issues raised by defendant, holding that imposition of consecutive sentences upon him did not violate the rule of Apprendi, that certain provisions in the post-conviction relief statute were not unconstitutional, and that defendant's conviction and sentence for armed robbery should be vacated because they were encompassed in the felony murder conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff beneficiary brought an action against defendant attorney for legal practice in the preparation of a will and trust for the beneficiary's mother. The attorney filed a motion to dismiss the action as untimely under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-214.3(d) (1994). The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted the motion. The beneficiary appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the beneficiary contended that the circuit court misinterpreted 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-241.3(d), and that the statute was unconstitutional as applied by the court. The appellate court held that the circuit court properly applied the statute. The appellate court noted that while the effect on the beneficiary was to shorten the period of time in which she had to filed her claim, it could neither restrict nor enlarge the meaning of the unambiguous statute. In addition, the court noted that the fact that a repose provision barred the action before it was discovered was an accidental rather than a necessary consequence. As to the constitutionality issued, the appellate court found that any distinction drawn by the statute was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose, and therefore, the statute was not unconstitutional. The court concluded that the statute reflected, inter alia, a policy of law intended to balance several different interests, provided a claimant with a reasonable time after the decedent's death to pursue a cause of action, and balanced the defendant's right to be free of stale claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) that convicted him after trial to the bench of three counts each of attempted murder, armed violence, and aggravated battery and sentenced him to consecutive terms of imprisonment on the first two groups of offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three eyewitnesses identified defendant as the person who shot and wounded several people in the course of a gang fight. Although their identification evidence was inconsistent in some respects, the appeals court upheld the trial court's credibility determination, including its finding that the witnesses' delay in coming forward was attributable to fear of reprisals. Since the trial was to the court, references to defendant's gang moniker were not prejudicial. Defendant's armed violence convictions, and the sentences imposed thereon, had to be vacated, because those offenses were too closely related to attempted first-degree murder, but the appeals court upheld (although it held that they could not be consecutive to defendant's sentence on an unrelated conviction) the imposition of consecutive sentences for attempted murder because the trial court's determination that a victim's bodily injuries were severe within the meaning of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a) was entitled to deference.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the armed violence convictions but affirmed the others; it also ordered resentencing to avoid stacking of sentences with a prior sentence, but upheld the imposition of consecutive sentences as to the attempted murder convictions.</SPAN></P>

He filed a petition to rescind the summary suspension. Following a hearing, the petition was denied, by order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which also denied his motion for reconsideration. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At his suspension hearing, defendant and his girlfriend testified defendant had not been driving when he was arrested for drunk driving. The police officers did not testify, but an officer's reports were received into evidence, over defendant's objections. Based upon the reports, the suspension was upheld by the trial court. The appellate court found that defendant presented a prima facie case for rescission of the suspension. Although the admission of the police officer's reports raised constitutional concerns, the fact that defendant could subpoena the officers generally provided an adequate opportunity for cross-examination, such that the statute allowing the officer's report to be received into evidence, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-118.1 (2000), was constitutional. However, in the instant case there was no showing that the motorist was informed of his right to subpoena the officers or the consequences of failing to exercise his right. There was no showing of a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to subpoena the officers. As such, the trial court erred in denying the petition to rescind the summary suspension based on the officer's official reports.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens sued defendants, board and others, alleging that 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-3.25g was unconstitutional and sought to enjoin the disbursement of public funds to the board until it complied with the statutory requirement of daily physical education. All parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. The citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens argued that (1) the physical education curriculum was protected from waiver by 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/34-8.14(3) (1996)); (2) 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-3.25g (1996) was unconstitutional because it modified existing law without following procedural constitutional formalities; (3) 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-3.25g (1996) constituted an unconstitutional legislative veto; and (4) 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-3.25g (1996) was an impermissible delegation of legislative authority to school boards. The appellate court held (1) the physical education curriculum was not protected by 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/34-8.14(3) (1996) because it was not specifically excluded, (2) 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-3.25g (1996) was not unconstitutional because it was modified in accordance with all procedural requirements for passage of a bill, (3) it had no jurisdiction to address the veto argument, and (4) there was no impermissible delegation of legislative authority since the legislature did not delegate its general legislative powers to school districts, and the school districts could only petition for a waiver. Thus, the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants was not in error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the enhanced-term sentencing part of a judgment of the Lake County Circuit Court (Illinois) convicting her on guilty plea of armed violence premised on aggravated battery, arguing that the sentence violated the rule of Apprendi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted having stabbed an elderly drinking companion more than 50 times, and, pursuant to a plea agreement, pled guilty to armed violence.

The appeals court held that the trial court's action in thereafter imposing an enhanced sentence based on those factors violated the constitutional rule of Apprendi, which required that other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum had to be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant never waived her right to have those issues submitted to a jury, so they could not be used for sentence enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of killing his estranged wife. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that his wife intended to divorce him and leave the state. The appellate court held that other circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish a basis to infer that defendant was aware of her plan, and made the evidence of the wife's intentions relevant both to suggest defendant's motive and to rebut his claim of self-defense. Defendant failed to show plain error when trial court sustained an objection to a question defense counsel asked and when the trial court failed to instruct the jury sua sponte on the lesser mitigated offense of second degree murder. Defendant failed to preserve the objections in a motion for new trial and as he failed in showing the necessity of plain error review, these issues were waived. Under Apprendi, other than a prior conviction, any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum needed to be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  730 Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence by a jury in the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County, Illinois, for aggravated battery with a firearm and aggravated discharge of a firearm, after a conviction for aggravated battery with a firearm in a first trial was vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the joinder of the aggravated discharge of a firearm after defendant's conviction for aggravated battery with a firearm in a first trial was vacated violated the mandatory joinder provisions of the Criminal Code of 1961, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1-1 et seq. (2000). Since the indictment made no attempt to differentiate between one pull of the trigger and another, the State was required to prosecute all of the offenses arising out of defendant's single act of firing the gun at the three victims in a single prosecution, and the State was precluded from amending the indictment after the first conviction was vacated. Defendant's conviction for aggravated battery with a firearm was affirmed because the statute creating the offense did not violate the single subject rule. The statute that enacted the offense was naturally and logically related to a single subject, crime. Thus, defendant failed to rebut the presumed constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that defendant suffered no violation of his rights or of due process when his prior commissions of driving under the influence (DUI) were found to be the functional equivalent of &quot;convictions&quot; for sentencing. Based on a review of caselaw, under the facts presented, 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 11/501(d)(1)(A), (d)(2), as applied to the defendant, merely provide an enhanced penalty based on the commission of prior crimes. Both of defendant's prior commissions of DUI were the functional equivalent of the &quot;convictions&quot;. The defendant's prior disposition of supervision for the commission of one prior DUI in 1983 and a sentence of probation for another DUI conviction in 1985 were the incidents at issue. They were not elements of the crime that needed to be proved to the trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, they were factors in aggravation that had to be proved at sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to first degree murder and was sentenced to natural life in prison.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his sentence violated the constitutional rule set forth in Apprendi and should be vacated. Defendant's primary argument was that the brutal and heinous nature of the crime was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore, Apprendi should control. The appellate court held, however, that the trial court did not sentence defendant based solely on a factor that was not alleged in the indictment or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The court noted that first degree murder while committing the forcible felony of robbery was plainly charged in the indictment. Further, the State presented evidence of the crime in open court, and the trial court found there was an adequate factual basis for the plea. Finally, the appellate court found defendant's guilty plea was a knowing admission of guilt of the criminal acts charged and all the material facts alleged. Thus, defendant was sentenced according to the statute for the offense to which he knowingly pled guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted petitioner State summary judgment, declaring respondent mother was an unfit parent of her two minor children under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. &sect; 50/1(D)(q) (1998). The mother appealed. The mother argued that &sect; 1(D)(q)'s 1998 amendment to create a statutory presumption of unfitness could not be applied retroactively to her 1992 aggravated battery conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother hit the older minor with a cord, and after her guilty plea was convicted of aggravated battery. The mother did not consistently take her required medications for her psychiatric problems. The older minor was in a foster home when the mother delivered the younger minor. The younger minor was adjudicated at risk, based in part upon the mother's conviction for her striking the older minor and the mother's inability and unwillingness to care for the younger minor. The trial court then granted the State's petitions that the mother was an unfit parent to both minors. The appeals court upheld the State's arguments based upon &sect; 1(D)(q). The mother's claim to raise her own child was a liberty interest but not a vested right. Section 1(D)(q) did not violate the Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses under a heightened protection strict scrutiny analysis. Section 1(D)(q) presumed that the mother was unfit, since she was convicted of a crime. Abuse of any child (not limited to the child for whom termination was sought), was a per se (not rebuttable) factor to establish parental unfitness, and could be applied retroactively to effect an overriding State interest.</SPAN></P>

Because the trial had not yet begun at the time of the motion, and because the trial court had allowed the providers sufficient time to respond to the motion despite the representatives' failure to give adequate notice, and because the providers were awarded costs, the representatives were entitled to dismissal as a matter of right under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1009. Because the trial court had clearly found that the representatives sought dismissal only because they had been unsuccessful in challenging various rulings on their pretrial motions, however, it was also proper, under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 219(e), for the award of costs to go beyond court costs, to include many of the providers' litigation expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by indictment with the felony of aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fact of defendant's two prior DUI convictions was not submitted to the jury. At the sentencing hearing, the State offered defendant's two prior DUI violations into evidence, which enhanced the offense from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class 4 felony. On appeal, defendant argued that (1) his conviction for felony DUI should have been reduced to misdemeanor DUI because the State presented no evidence to the jury that he had two prior DUI violations, and 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501(d)(1)(A) was unconstitutional pursuant to Apprendi. The appellate court held that the aggravated DUI terminology used in 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501 simply referred to an aggravated or enhanced sentence for a third or subsequent DUI.  625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-501(d)(1)(A) was a recidivist sentencing statute for repeat DUI offenders.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to several grave felonies, and received a 70-year extended sentence, after being advised that the State of Illinois was seeking the death penalty and that the trial court was disposed to sentence him to up to 120 years. After he pled guilty, the Apprendi case announced the federal constitutional rule that any fact, other than a prior conviction, used to extend a defendant's sentence beyond a statutory maximum required a jury finding beyond reasonable doubt. Defendant's failure to preserve a constitutional issue would not have precluded review even if Apprendi had been decided earlier. In conflict with other Illinois appeals courts, the instant court applied this constitutional rule in cases of guilty pleas. Defendant's sentence did not violate Apprendi, however, because the trial court explicitly found defendant death penalty-eligible and then decided to impose an extended sentence by reason of heinousness. Death was the maximum sentence, so the rule was not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A liquor retailer in Chicago, Illinois, had its license suspended by the local liquor commission. Pursuant to 235 Ill. Comp.

The argument that the retailer's lawyer did not receive timely notice of the suspension failed because it was reasonable, and not a denial of due process or equal protection, to use ordinary mail notice within the city, and the lawyer should have arranged for mail to be monitored while he was out of town.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Marion County Circuit Court (Illinois) convicting him on guilty verdict of residential burglary and from that portion of the sentencing order directing the corrections department to withhold 50 percent of his in-prison earnings until court costs were covered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another entered a family's burned-out mobile home and defendant stole some clothing before he and his friend left, afraid of being seen. The appeals court upheld defendant's conviction of residential burglary in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/19-3, instead of the less serious offense of burglary, because when the family left the mobile home that evening, they attempted to secure it and intended to return, although they never did move back in. The existence of two potential offenses arising out of the same conduct was not unconstitutional because they were mutually exclusive; no defendant could be convicted of both as a consequence of a single act. The trial court had, however, exceeded its authority in directing that half of defendant's earnings in prison be withheld until court costs had been repaid, so that portion of the sentencing order was vacated, but a direction that defendant pay court costs within six months after release was allowed to stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, except that it vacated the portion of the sentencing order that directed that court costs be withheld from prison earnings. It remanded with directions to correct the sentencing order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant non-home rule municipality denied plaintiff owner variances to operate her home day care facility using a non-resident employee after determining her facility was not a home occupation permitted in R-1, R-2, and R-3 residential zones. A Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) judgment granted the owner's partial summary judgment motion in her declaratory and injunctive relief suit. The municipality appealed and moved to stay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court determined that: (1) the municipality's zoning ordinance excluding commercial day care businesses in homes was not valid; (2) the municipality was partially pre-empted by Illinois law from regulating home day care to the extent regulations conflicted with the Child Care Act of 1969, 225 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/1 et seq. (1998), and could not effectively exclude them through zoning. The appeals court summarized the reasons for child-care licensing. The operator was licensed and subject to regulation by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to provide home care. The non-home rule municipality only could exercise powers, including zoning regulations, specifically granted to it, and not reserved by, Illinois. Illinois policy mandated that home care be allowed and not excluded, notwithstanding the municipality's goal of neighborhood tranquility. The allowance of day care facilities in non-residential zones was not a substitute for the requirement to allow home care in residential zones. The appeals court compared other cases involving licensed occupations that had been effectively excluded by municipality regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) judgment adjudicated that respondent minor was delinquent after he was arrested and detained by petitioner State for unlawful use and unlawful possession of a firearm. The minor appealed, contending that the pretrial detention provision of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, particularly 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/5-501 (1998), violated the United States and Illinois Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was first arrested on possession of controlled substance. The State filed for adjudication of wardship on that charge but the proceedings were not finalized before the minor was arrested on the firearm charges. The appeals court noted that no judge had signed a detention order on the controlled substance charges. The minor did not have standing to contest constitutionality of the detention statute for the controlled substance charges but did for the firearm charges. The appeals court summarized the reasons for the differences between the constitutional protections for criminal defendants and the due process protections for juvenile defendants in the non-adversarial civil proceedings. The principal distinguishing factors were related to the primary goal of rehabilitating a juvenile. Therefore, the juvenile did not have to be afforded criminal protections under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 (1990) and U.S. Const. amends. IV, VI (rights to preliminary hearing, effective counsel, and probable cause).  705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/5-501 (1998) satisfied any U.S. Const. amend. IV probable cause requirements. There also was probable cause to detain defendant on the firearm charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vehicle driven by defendant was stopped and searched by police because of defendant's violation of Chicago's sound-device restriction ordinance, Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 11-4-1115 (1996) (ordinance). Defendant was charged with criminal offenses after he was found in possession of illegal drugs. In granting the motion to suppress, the trial court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that a regulation that was content neutral and was a place and manner type of regulation was subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny, while a strict scrutiny test was applied if the ordinance or statute was content-based. The ordinance was content neutral and was a constitutionally permitted time and place regulation. It was narrowly tailored to serve an important governmental interest and it allowed open ample alternative channels for communication of protected speech. Preserving quiet was a significant governmental interest and noise from a vehicle could be regulated. The trial court erred in ruling the ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Police obtained a key from the girlfriend's roommate and used it to enter the apartment. When they did so, they found defendant asleep, woke him, ordered him to dress, and asked him questions. They also searched the apartment and found a handgun. The appellate court held that (1) defendant had no standing to challenge the search because he had been asked to leave the apartment before the search occurred and, as such, was no longer a guest in the apartment; (2) defendant was not in custody when police initially questioned him and answers he gave to their questions were admissible even though police did not read Miranda rights to defendant until they found the handgun and arrested him; (3) the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for use or possession of a weapon by a felon; but (4) the trial court incorrectly calculated court costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of home invasion, aggravated battery, and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. The Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit, Peoria County, Illinois, sentenced defendant to 25 years' imprisonment for home invasion and 5 years' imprisonment for the firearm conviction to be served concurrently. Defendant was not sentenced for aggravated battery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the same person named in a certified copy of a 1992 conviction for attempted armed robbery. The appellate court noted that defendant did not object to the State's introduction of the certified copy of conviction. On the contrary, defendant accepted the judge's suggested manner of handling this evidence. Thus, on appeal, defendant could not contend the trial court was in error by doing what he asked. Defendant also argued the truth-in-sentencing provision of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3(a)(2)(iii) violated his due process and jury trial rights under Apprendi. The appellate court concluded that since the maximum penalty under the statute was not increased, the truth-in-sentencing provision was not unconstitutional under Apprendi. Finally, defendant contended his aggravated battery conviction should have been vacated under the one-act, one-crime principles. Although the trial judge did not use the term, &quot;one-act, one-crime,&quot; he did say that he would not impose a sentence for the defendant's aggravated battery conviction because it was based on the same physical act as the home invasion conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's aggravated battery conviction was vacated. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered the victim in the course of committing armed robbery, and was sentenced to consecutive sentences for each offense. His argument that his consecutive sentences without jury findings supporting them violated the constitutional rule of Apprendi had been rejected by the high court, but two appellate issues remained: whether the scheme violated due process and whether it constituted impermissible double sentence enhancement. The intermediate court found no constitutional impropriety. The armed robbery was a triggering offense within the meaning of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4 and it led to the serious injury, that is, the death of the victim. The sentences themselves were separate sentences, imposed for discrete offenses (since it was perfectly possible to commit armed robbery without physically hurting anyone), not two enhancements of a single sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's consecutive sentencing scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), dismissing his petition for relief, pursuant to the Postconviction Hearing Act (the Act), 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq. (West 1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the defendant had not waived his right to postconviction relief, as he could have raised his ineffectiveness of counsel argument on direct appeal. But the defendant had been examined and declared fit for trial. His counsel was not ineffective for failing to investigate the defendant's psychiatric records after he was released. Besides access to the records would not have changed this case, as no bona fide doubt existed as to the defendant's fitness to stand trial. The defendant failed to set forth the gist of a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The record contradicted the defendant's allegations that he was heavily medicated at the time of his guilty plea and that his attorney coerced him into pleading guilty. Summary dismissal of his petition was proper. The defendant received the required admonishments and made a quintessential waiver of his Apprendi-based sentencing objection by pleading guilty. See 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq. (West 1998). 1983 Ill. Laws 83 did not violate the single subject rule.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the university argued that the cause of action was one for a writ of certiorari and that the cause of action arose in Sangamon County, where the proceedings and decisions of the court of claims sought to be reviewed occurred. According to the university, all transactions, and all parts thereof, between the injured party and the court of claims took place in Sangamon County. The petition for writ of certiorari did not seek the review of any facts or issues in the underlying personal injury lawsuit but only sought a determination as to whether the court of claims' decision violated the injured party's due process rights. None of the issues involved in the underlying cause of action were involved in the certiorari action. The proper venue for the certiorari action did not lie in Pope County, but in Sangamon County, where the principal office of the court of claims was located.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a prison inmate. A correctional officer opened his cell door. Defendant stepped outside and spit in the officer's face. As a result, the State charged him with aggravated battery. Before defendant's trial and out of the jury's presence, the trial court addressed at a hearing the issue of defendant's propensity to spit. It heard evidence about his history of misconduct, including the spitting. It also learned he had two convictions and other charges pending against him. Defendant told the trial court he would not spit in the courtroom. The trial court ordered him to wear a mask at trial. Both parties agreed it would be best not to explain the mask to the jury, but one witness identified defendant as the person wearing the mask. Defendant was convicted. His sentence was made consecutive to other sentences against him. After judgment was entered, the appellate court found: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering him to wear the mask, (2) he was not denied a fair trial when he was identified as the person wearing the mask, (3) he did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel, and (4) the consecutive sentencing was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder, armed robbery, and aggravated battery. A jury found defendant guilty of armed robbery and acquitted him of the other charges. The State moved to have defendant sentenced as an adult. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted the motion and sentenced defendant to 30 years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the sentencing statute under which he was charged as an adult was unconstitutional, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to take into account all statutory factors enumerated in the sentencing statute, and his sentence was disparate to that of his codefendants. The appellate court held that defendant's constitutional claim was waived on review since he conceded the issue. The appellate court next found that the trial court properly evaluated and applied the statutory sentencing factors. Thus, there was no abuse of discretion. Finally, as to defendant's argument that his sentence should have been reduced or his cause remanded due to the disparity of his sentence and his codefendants' sentences, the court found no error. The court noted that although it was the maximum nonextended sentence allowable, defendant's sentence was within the statutorily permissible range. In addition, the record established that the codefendants entered into voluntary negotiated guilty pleas, whereby they pled guilty to the offenses of first degree murder and armed robbery, while defendant declined the plea agreement and chose to proceed to trial.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3 in establishing an unwritten policy denying good-time credit to inmates charged with or convicted of domestic battery. Because the refusal of the inmate's good-time credit was based on an unwritten policy that excluded inmates with domestic battery arrests from eligibility, the director abused his discretion when he refused to award good-time credit based on an unwritten policy, outside the scope of his authority. Because the director did not offer any other standard to deny good-time credit, the court assumed that but for the unwritten policy the inmate would have been entitled to good-time credit. Because it was necessary for the trial court to order the director to exercise his discretion and grant inmate good-time credit before releasing him, he was not entitled to habeas corpus relief. The inmate was entitled to immediate discharge from custody under mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree murder and armed robbery. Defendant waived a jury trial and entered a guilty plea. Defendant was sentenced to an extended term of 70 years' imprisonment based on the trial judge's finding that mitigating factors precluding imposition of the death penalty. Defendant filed a motion for reconsideration. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) summarily dismissed the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant argued his extended-term sentence was unconstitutional under Apprendi. The State argued defendant's failure to raise an Apprendi challenge to his sentence in his postconviction petition waived the challenge. The appellate court held that because the element used to enhance defendant's sentence was never charged in the indictment, defendant could not be said to have waived his right to have the jury determine that element beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, defendant's plea of guilty did not waive his right to have a sentencing factor, except for a prior conviction, which extended his sentence beyond the maximum allowed by statute and which was not charged in the indictment, determined beyond a reasonable doubt, and Apprendi applied. The State next argued that the 70-year sentence imposed was not beyond the prescribed statutory maximum. The appellate court held that the maximum sentence defendant could receive was 60 years since he was never charged with brutal and heinous behavior, and since defendant was sentenced to a term of years, the statutory maximum for murder in Illinois was 60 years.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Denial of defendant's postconviction petition was affirmed. The extended-term sentence of 70 years' imprisonment was modified to 60 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal from the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) respondent child challenged the court's order that required him to register as a juvenile sex offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the sex offender registration statute,&nbsp;730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 150/1 et seq., did not require juveniles to register as sex offenders. Although the statute contained a definition of a juvenile sex offender, it did not explicitly require juvenile sex offenders to register. Under rules of statutory construction, the lower court erred by reading into 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 150/1 et seq. a requirement that children register. Sex offenders and juvenile sex offenders were defined as separate classes, but only sex offenders were required to register. Moreover, requiring a delinquent juvenile to register as a sex offender was inconsistent with the purposes of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/1 et seq. In the absence of a clearer expression of its intention, the court would not assume that the legislature intended to authorize the release of information about a minor and his offense when the same information could not be released under 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/1 et seq.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alarm company sought a permanent injunction preventing defendant village from enforcing an ordinance that required owners of commercial buildings to connect their fire alarm systems directly to the village's fire board for monitoring. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) granted summary judgment in favor of the village. The alarm company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that a municipality had the authority under 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/11-8-2, 11-30-4 (1998) to amend national building or fire codes or draft its own codes as it determined necessary to protect the public safety and welfare. Accordingly, the village had the authority to enact the instant ordinance requiring all fire alarm systems in new and existing commercial buildings be tied directly to the village's fire board. The appellate court noted that there was a reasonable basis for the determination by the village that public safety required the application of the ordinance to existing buildings. In addition, the appellate court held that the ordinance was not a de facto regulation on fire alarm companies, nor was it a violation of the Illinois Antitrust Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/1 et seq. (1998). Finally, the appellate court concluded that although the alarm company failed to raise the issue prior to its appeal, the ordinance was not an unconstitutional infringement upon its right to contract, but rather was a reasonable legislative judgment tailored toward the improvement of the public welfare and safety.</SPAN></P>

Defendant could not properly raise his Apprendi argument on collateral review. Prior case law had concluded that 1983 Ill.

He appealed his convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first degree murder, armed robbery, and home invasion after co-defendants told police they entered a house with defendant to commit a robbery and that defendant killed a person inside the house during the robbery. During his opening statement at trial, the prosecutor described the conversations that police had with the co-defendants and, when he questioned the officers who conducted the investigation, the prosecutor asked them to recount what the co-defendants had told them about the defendant's actions. Defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor's opening statement or the police officers' testimony and, at the close of trial, a jury returned a general verdict finding defendant guilty of all charges. The appellate court held that: (1) the prosecutor's conduct breached the investigative process exception to the hearsay rule, but, as there was other evidence of defendant's guilt, the violation was harmless error; (2) the trial court properly sentenced defendant to consecutive sentences even though the crimes arose from a single course of conduct; but (3) defendant was not given proper credit against his sentence for time already served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Where the tenant was a patient in the hospital when a crime occurred, had no knowledge of its commission, and had no restraining influence over the criminals at the time they committed the crime, the trial court's finding they were not &quot;under tenant's control&quot; was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The fact the one of the criminals was named on the tenant's lease did not warrant her eviction. The lease was ambiguous, and its terms had to be construed against the housing authority as the drafter of the lease. The tenant had to exercise control over household members and guests as well as other persons who engaged in criminal activity in order to allow the tenant's eviction. It appeared that the eviction of innocent tenants was not part of the congressional scheme for housing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged the trial court erred in allowing the submission of other-crimes evidence to the jury because such evidence infected his trial with a prejudice that compelled reversal of his convictions. The appellate court noted that the State possessed overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. The appellate court held that the probative value of the other-crimes evidence was compelling, and under such a circumstance, it was within the trial judge's discretion to admit the evidence, even though the State's other evidence may well have carried the day without it. The appellate court also noted that while the other-crimes evidence demonstrated a penchant for killing and stealing, it had the kind of probative value necessary to outweigh the prejudice to defendant. Finally, the appellate court held that since the life sentence was established as the maximum sentence in lieu of death, the life sentence was imposed in accordance with the procedural safeguards of a jury trial, and there was no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions for first-degree murder, aggravated vehicular hijacking, and attempted murder, and sentences imposed, were affirmed.

The appellate court held that there was no error in sentencing defendant to life because such an imposition could be made based on that fact that the murdered individual was a DOC employee or that defendant previously had been convicted of murder in another state. The court also held that because the exculpatory witness's testimony was unsubstantiated and not credible, there was no violation of defendant's constitutional rights with respect to denial of the witness's testimony. Finally, the appellate court concluded it could not say, as a matter of law, that defense counsel's decision not to call certain witnesses was a matter of trial strategy. The court remanded the matter for an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery, and was sentenced to life imprisonment under the Habitual Criminal Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 33B-1 et seq. (1983). Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County (Illinois), granted the State's 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-615 motion to dismiss. Defendant appealed the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Act was unconstitutional under the Apprendi doctrine. A writ of habeas corpus was available to obtain the release of a prisoner where some occurrence after the prisoner's conviction entitled him to release. In Apprendi, the Supreme Court held that, except for a prior conviction, any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum had to be submitted to the finder of fact and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court held that defendant met all of the conditions for a mandatory natural life sentence under the Act. The appellate court held that the Act did not violate the rule of Apprendi. The Apprendi decision made clear that it did not consider recidivism to be a fact that fell within its holding. Because the Act was not unconstitutional under Apprendi, defendant was not entitled to release from prison. Taking the facts in the light most favorable to the State, the appellate court held that defendant did not allege facts in his petition that would compel the trial court to grant him habeas corpus relief. Therefore, the trial court properly granted the State's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Circuit Court of the 10th Judicial Circuit, Tazewell County (Illinois) judgment dismissed as frivolous defendant's successive post-conviction petition. Defendant appealed and argued that (1) 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-2.1 ( 2000) was unconstitutional; and (2) his 80-year extended term sentence violated the constitutional rule set forth in Apprendi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's 1989 first degree murder conviction had been affirmed, and dismissal by the trial court of defendant's 1994 first post-conviction relief petition had been affirmed. The appeals court had previously held that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-2.1 (2000), enacted under 1983 Ill. Laws 942, did not violate the single subject clause of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d) (1970). The appeals court then determined that Apprendi could be applied retroactively as falling within the second Teague exception as a core due process right. Apprendi held that as a matter of due process, any facts, other than a prior conviction, that increased the penalty for an offense beyond the statutory maximum had to be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant timely filed, under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1(c) (2000), the instant second post-conviction relief petition two months after the United States Supreme Court decided Apprendi in June 2000. The Apprendi due process claim could not have been presented in the earlier proceeding. Accordingly, the appeals court refused to apply the procedural limits of waiver and res judicata to bar defendant's successive petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court found that the imposition of defendant's extended term sentence of 80 years was unconstitutional. The appeals court, therefore, vacated the judgment of the circuit court and modified defendant's sentence to the maximum possible sentence for first degree murder under the applicable statute, which was 60 years in prison.</SPAN></P>

Defendant next argued that the trial court improperly allowed the State to elicit an opinion from a witness that defendant killed a victim. The appellate court noted that although the testimony reflected the witness's opinion, the jury was free to accept or reject that opinion. Defendant next argued that the trial court coerced a verdict from the jury. The appellate court noted that the record reflected that the foreperson informed the deputy that after review of testimony they could ultimately reach a verdict. Thus, there was no error in the trial court's communication to the jury. The court next determined that defendant's motion for a continuance was properly denied based on the circumstances surrounding the request.</SPAN></P>

The housing authority was not only immune from liability for negligence, it was also immune from liability for willful and wanton acts. The &quot;voluntary undertaking&quot; doctrine did not supercede its statutory immunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A former employee challenged his employer's practice, allegedly engaged in with the cooperation of his union and others, of making certain deductions from paychecks that resulted in payment of less than time and a half for overtime, in violation of Illinois wage statutes. After he moved for class certification, but before his motion could be ruled on, the employer and the others offered him a settlement that included everything he asked for. The appeals court held that ordinarily such an offer, which the employee rejected, would have mooted his claim, but that under the circumstances, where there was reason to think the offer was made to prevent him from developing his possible claim on behalf of the class, it was error to dismiss the employee's action for want of jurisdiction before ruling on the class certification motion.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff department filed a complaint to enforce the subpoena. The dentists answered, asserting the physician-patient privilege. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) granted the department's motion. The dentists appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentists contended on appeal that summary judgment was improper because issues of material fact existed; dentists were considered surgeons under Illinois law, and therefore covered by the physician-patient privilege; and the material requested by the department fell under the physician-patient privilege. Upon review, the appellate court concluded that no issues of material fact existed which precluded summary judgment. Further, the failure of the dentists to offer facts to rebut the department's assertion that they were under an investigation was fatal to their argument that summary judgment on this basis was improper. The appellate court found that the issuance of the subpoena alone was sufficient for the circuit court to conclude that the documents were needed, and that there was a sufficient basis for the circuit court to conclude that the purpose of the investigation was to protect the public from risk of harm from the dentists. As to privilege, the appellate court held that the dentists were surgeons, and therefore covered by the physician-patient privilege. The court held that the patient files were protected, but the appointment book records were not privileged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her controlled substance conviction and sentence by the Circuit Court of the 14th Judicial Circuit Henry County, Illinois, claiming that the admission of lab reports violated her constitutional right to confrontation and that her mandatory prison sentence violated Apprendi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle was stopped by the police after it veered off the roadway. After she was placed under arrest for driving with a suspended license, her vehicle was searched and bags of a white substance were discovered. Defendant's signed, written statement and a lab report proving the substance was cocaine were admitted at trial. The appellate court held that not only did defendant fail to object to the admission of the lab reports at trial, she stipulated to them. Therefore, they were properly admitted into evidence pursuant to the stipulation rather than the unconstitutional statutory provisions of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/115-15. Because she was sentenced under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3(c)(2)(D), the amount of cocaine found was a sentencing factor and not an element of the crime. Therefore, the judge could make the finding and impose the mandatory minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) convicted defendant of two counts of armed robbery. The trial court imposed concurrent extended term sentences of 50 years. The convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. Defendant then filed a pro se petition seeking post-conviction or habeas corpus relief. The trial court summarily dismissed the petition. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that, under Apprendi, he was entitled to relief because former Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b)(1), 1005-8-2 (1981) (now codified at 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3.2(b)(1), 5-8-2), pursuant to which his extended term sentences were imposed, were unconstitutional as they allowed a sentence beyond the statutory maximum upon the finding of facts not submitted to the jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court held that the Apprendi Court exempted prior convictions from the category of sentence enhancing facts which had to be submitted to a jury for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant also argued that the extended term sentence violated his right to a jury trial under the Illinois constitution. The appellate court found that a prior conviction did not relate to the commission of the offense with which an accused was charged and that a prior conviction was the result of proceedings in which defendant had the right to a trial by jury and the State was required to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. These safeguards mitigated constitutional concerns regarding due process rights and jury trial guarantees.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, defendant filed a post conviction petition. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) summarily dismissed the petition on the ground that it was time-barred. Defendant then filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not ask to amend his petition, but did claim in his motion to reconsider that he was free from culpable neglect in failing to file on time. Defendant alleged that he was placed in segregation for six months and was denied access to his legal materials until after the deadline. The appellate court held that defendant could be excused from failing to file in a timely manner if he showed that he was not culpably negligent. A post conviction petition did not need to include allegations of lack of culpable negligence, but could be later amended to include them. Defendant should not have been summarily deprived pursuit of post-conviction relief simply because he neglected to label his motion correctly. The trial court erred in not considering the motion for reconsideration as a motion to amend the pleadings. If defendant had been placed in segregation through no fault of his own or otherwise prevented from filing his petition for a period of time after the deadline, his failure to file in a timely manner was not culpable negligence. However, defendant's Apprendi issue was stricken, as Apprendi could not be applied retroactively to cases pending on collateral review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prison warden established controlled-feeding status, whereby inmates received &quot;meal loaf&quot; as a punishment for certain misconduct relating to food.

Former &sect; 3-8-7(b)(1) only prohibited the denial to inmates of nutritionally adequate food for disciplinary reasons. Because the meal loaf was nutritionally adequate, it did not violate former &sect; 3-8-7(b)(1).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, chairman of the holding company, holding company, and acquired company filed an interlocutory appeal of the order of the Circuit Court of McHenry County (Illinois) denying their motion to dismiss plaintiff shareholder's complaint, alleging, among other things, the chairman's improper purchase of stock from the other management shareholders and the contravention of the shareholder's agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holding company was a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois. The holding company's shareholders' agreement contained a choice of law provision choosing Nebraska law. When the stock purchases made by the holding company chairman occurred, leading to this action, none of the parties were residents of Illinois. However, the chairman thereafter became an Illinois resident. The subject of this appeal was whether the Illinois borrowing statute for limitations periods, 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-210, was applicable to this case and whether the Delaware limitations period governed the shareholder agreement. The appellate court found that 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/13-210 was applicable to this case, although none of the parties was an Illinois resident when the cause of action accrued, because the chairman later became a resident before the limitations period of the jurisdiction in which the cause of action accrued expired. The Delaware limitations period governed the shareholder agreement, because Delaware, as the state of the holding company's incorporation, had an overriding interest in regulating the internal affairs of the holding company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the Illinois borrowing statute for limitations period was applicable and a Delaware limitations period applied to the shareholder agreement. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, accused of murdering his wife, appealed an order of the Winnebago County Circuit Court (Illinois) denying bail. He challenged the constitutionality of 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/110-4(b), and also argued that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with murdering his wife, faced a possible sentence of life imprisonment under Illinois law. His request for pretrial release on bail was denied pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/110-4, which precluded bail where the proof of a defendant's guilt was evident or the presumption of guilt was great. The trial court held that defendant had failed to satisfy his statutory burden that he did not fall under that prohibition. The appeals court, after surveying case law from many jurisdictions, determined that the portion of the statute that imposed a burden of proof on defendant violated his due process right, under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, to a presumption of innocence. Once that part of the statute was severed, however, the rest of the statute simply tracked Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, and could be upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order denying bail and remanded for a new proceeding at which the State was to bear the burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and her boyfriend had a 10-year relationship. During that time, the mother was artificially inseminated, conceived, and delivered twins.

The mother terminated the relationship when she discovered that the boyfriend was already married. She sued for paternity and support. The trial court granted the boyfriend's motions to dismiss. The appellate court held that the boyfriend's oral promise to support the children was unenforceable.  750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 40/3(a) (act) required written consent to an insemination procedure. The act did not discriminate against children born through artificial insemination to unmarried women.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of capital murder, residential burglary, robbery, and theft over $ 10,000. After a death penalty sentencing hearing, the jury did not impose the death penalty. The Circuit Court of Williamson County (Illinois), entered judgment and imposed a life sentence for the murder, concurrent 7-year terms for the robbery and theft, and a 15-year consecutive sentence for the residential burglary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the State's peremptory challenge of the sole African-American juror, asserting the removal was racially motivated. The State gave three race-neutral reasons for the challenge. The appellate court found the record supported the State's tendered reasons to challenge the juror, and there was no deprivation of the right to equal protection of the law. The use of defendant's prior fingerprint card did not cause undue prejudice, as the State made no mention of the fact that defendant was under arrest when the inked prints were made, and there were many potential explanations for a government agency to have a person's fingerprints on file. Also, since they were necessary to establish identity, it was not necessarily error to admit them into evidence. As for the sentencing, since a jury determined beyond a reasonable doubt those facts that exposed defendant to a life term, the sentence was proper. The claim challenging the validity of the consecutive sentences was also rejected, as the sentences defendant received were within the statutory range, and Apprendi considerations did not apply to consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>

Consequently, the vehicle was not taken from the immediate presence of the victim as required by the vehicular hijacking statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On October 1, 1998, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered an order granting in part and denying in part plaintiff officers' motion for summary judgment in their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 civil rights action. On April 11, 2000, the trial court entered an order denying the officers' amended motion for clarification and reconsideration of the October 1, 1998, order. The officers appealed. Defendant board cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the officers alleged that: (1) the trial court erred in refusing to adopt a construction of 1989 Ill. Laws 272 that would increase their pension benefits for service after age 63 and thereby avoid an unconstitutional interpretation; and (2) the trial court erred by not limiting the application of its ruling to only the officers whose benefits had been reduced. The appellate court held, first, that the board's conclusion that the three percent annual increases would accrue after age 63, but would not be paid until the officers actually retired, was consistent with the general rule that pension acts were to be liberally construed in favor of a pensioner's rights. Second, the application of 1989 Ill. Laws 272 unconstitutionally diminished the officers' benefits without due process of law, because they were not afforded a predeprivation hearing, as was required by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 5-189 (1989). Third, the officers were not entitled to service credit for years where they made no corresponding contribution. Finally, Ill. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 5, did not provide that a person had a vested right in any beneficial changes in a pension system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The October 1, 1998, order granting in part and denying in part the motion for summary judgment was affirmed with respect to plaintiffs whose benefits were diminished but reversed with respect to those whose benefits increased. The cause was remanded with directions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the trial court's exercise of discretion (1) to allow evidence of defendant's gang affiliation, noting, in part, that testimony regarding gang hierarchy was relevant and admissible to explain an otherwise inexplicable act and to establish an &quot;advancement within the ranks&quot; motive for the crime; and (2) to not allow defendant a 30-day continuance to find non-prison trial clothing for his 450 pound frame since defendant had three years to find clothing and was able to find clothing a day after denial of his motion. The appeals court reviewed 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a), (b) (1994). The trial court imposed consecutive sentences after its finding consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the public from further criminal conduct. Upon remand, the trial court was to determine whether (1) the offenses were part of a single course of conduct, and, if so, apply &sect; 5/5-8-4(a) consecutive sentencing only if all three components of &sect; 5/5-8-4(a) were met; and (2) if the offenses were not part of a single course of conduct, apply &sect; 5/5-8-4(b) consecutive sentencing if it determined such sentencing was necessary to protect the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Defendant-appellant's conviction for reckless homicide was vacated, trial court's judgment was reversed, and cause was remanded.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Circuit Court of the 12th Judicial Circuit, Will County (Illinois), defendant was convicted of two counts of reckless homicide. The trial court vacated one count and sentenced defendant to a term of 14 years' imprisonment on the remaining count. The trial court also ordered that half of defendant's monthly income be withheld for application to costs. Defendant appealed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the reckless homicide statute and the accompanying jury instructions mandated a presumption of recklessness that relieved the State of its burden of proving recklessness beyond a reasonable doubt, and other errors. The charges arose from an incident in which defendant caused a fatal auto accident while intoxicated. Defendant claimed that his brakes malfunctioned.  720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-3(b) stated that in cases involving reckless homicide, being under the influence of alcohol or any other drug or drugs at the time of the alleged violation would be presumed to be evidence of a reckless act unless disproved by evidence to the contrary. A mandatory presumption was one in which the finder of fact had to presume certain facts and was not free to reject the proffered presumption. All mandatory presumptions violated defendant's due process rights under both the Illinois and United States Constitutions. The court held the statute and jury instructions in question created a mandatory presumption which compelled the jury to presume that defendant was acting recklessly, thus effectively removing the burden of proving that element from the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reckless homicide conviction was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a religious organization and the people, appealed from decisions of the Circuit Court of Du Page County (Illinois) dismissing their suits for nuisance arising out operation of the airport owned by appellee, a city. The trial court dismissed the suits based on the city's immunity under the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/1-101. The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act (Act), 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/1-101, gave the city immunity from liability for nuisance, as a tort. The Act applied only to tort actions and did not bar actions for constitutional violations. Sections 1-204, 2-201, of the Act, codified at 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/1-204, 10/2-201, were not unconstitutionally vague. Finding immunity was proper even where no specific employee of the city was identified as causing the injury, because a municipal corporation can act only through the actions of its agents and officials. The nuisance alleged resulted from the airport's existence, location, and the manner in which the runways are laid out. These could only result from acts of discretion by city agents in policy-making positions. Therefore, the city's actions were discretionary in nature. Dismissal of the claims for nuisance was affirmed. However, as the Act did not protect the city from claims for injunctive relief, the trial court's orders were modified to dismissal of the claims without prejudice to afford the parties the opportunity to seek equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgments were affirmed, but modified to dismissal of the claims without prejudice. The matters were remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of misdemeanor retail theft after he stole merchandise valued at $ 22 from one store and merchandise valued at less than $ 150 from another store. The trial court accepted evidence that defendant had a 1993 conviction, and pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/16A-10(b) (1998), it used that conviction to elevate both offenses to Class 4 felonies. After hearing evidence that defendant had a drug problem, was HIV positive, and had an extensive criminal history, the trial court ordered defendant to serve the maximum period of confinement authorized for each offense and that he serve his sentences consecutively. The appellate court held that (1) the trial court was allowed to use defendant's 1993 conviction to enhance both charges because those charges were separate and factually distinct; (2) the trial court was required to impose consecutive sentences once the charges were enhanced because defendant committed his second offense while he was out of jail on bond awaiting trial for his first offense; and (3) defendant was not sentenced in violation of the United States Supreme Court's Apprendi opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty, in the Circuit Court of the 21st Judicial Circuit, Kankakee County (Illinois) to one count each of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child and child pornography. He was sentenced to consecutive prison terms of 15 and 7 years, respectively. Those terms were subsequently reduced to 12 and 5 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that his prison sentences should have been modified to run concurrently and that his aggregate sentence was unconstitutionally increased without proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the two offenses were committed as part of a single course of conduct. Prior to imposing sentence, the trial court had determined that the offenses were committed during a single incident. The appellate court held that the mandatory consecutive sentencing provisions of 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4 did not increase punishment exceeding the statutory maximum for each discrete offense, but only controlled how multiple sentences were served. Accordingly, sentences imposed pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4 did not violate the rule of Apprendi. Since the trial court determined that the two offenses were committed during a single course of conduct, it properly imposed mandatory consecutive sentences. However, the trial court proceedings in ordering forfeiture of a computer and digital camera were error as no forfeiture complaint was filed and no forfeiture hearing was held. The State's first mention of forfeiture did not come until the prosecutor's sentencing recommendation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of forfeiture was vacated, and the remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Williamson County (Illinois) convicted defendant of home invasion. The trial court found the victim of the crime suffered great bodily harm, and the court ordered defendant to serve 85 percent of his sentence, pursuant to section 3-6-3(a)(2)(iii) of the Unified Code of Corrections, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3(a)(2)(iii). Defendant moved to reconsider, the trial court denied the motion, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statutory provision under which he was required to serve 85 percent of his term of imprisonment is unconstitutional under the Apprendi doctrine. The Apprendi doctrine stated that other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court held that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3(a)(2)(iii) did not violate the Apprendi doctrine. Whether defendant served all or part of the term of imprisonment to which he was sentenced, that term would not be in excess of the prescribed maximum penalty for home invasion. The Apprendi doctrine did not constrain the legislature's ability to define the manner in which a sentence imposed within the statutory range must be served. The statutory scheme under which defendant was required to serve a minimum portion of his term of imprisonment neither altered the maximum penalty for the crime committed nor created a separate offense calling for a separate penalty, it only limited the sentencing court's discretion in selecting a penalty within the range already available to it.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed. Although the law was to be treated as if it had never existed, defendant's conviction and time served in prison existed and could not be treated otherwise.

The appellate court held that para. 1005-8-1 did not distinguish between first- and second-degree murder. It reviewed the laws of both states and found that they were similar. The similarity was not found in the statutory labels, but in the shared mental state requirements needed to support a conviction.

Comp. Stat. 505/13a, from commercial vehicles using the Illinois Tollway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At &sect; 13a of the Illinois Motor Fuel Tax Law, 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/13a, the legislature imposed a tax on commercial motor carriers for use, on Illinois highways, of fuel purchased outside the state. A national association of truck owner-operators, and some individual members, challenged the practice of collecting the tax from users of the Illinois Tollway as violative of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The appeals court held that the association lacked standing to pursue the constitutional challenge, because in Illinois associations could not sue on their members' behalf unless the organization was also directly injured. It then sustained the tax as satisfying a four-prong test of constitutionality, since the owner-operators' activity had a nexus with Illinois, the tax was fairly apportioned, it did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to services provided by Illinois, which included more than mere tollway use.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested, and crack cocaine was found near defendant in the vacant lot. A police investigator measured the distance between where defendant was arrested to the nearest school, and it was 752 feet.

Another victim was hit by gunshots and was severely injured. The trial court imposed an extended-term sentence for the murder on the basis that the murder victim was 71-years-old. The trial court also determined that defendant was eligible for consecutive sentences because defendant inflicted severe bodily harm on the attempted murder victim. Defendant argued that the extended-term sentence and consecutive sentences were unconstitutional under Apprendi, and that the sentences were excessive. The appellate court held that although an Apprendi violation may have occurred where the age of the victim was not submitted to a jury, such violation amounted to harmless error where, had the issue of the victim's age been submitted to a jury, a jury would have still found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Apprendi explicitly disclaimed any holding regarding consecutive sentencing. The record showed that the trial court did consider factors in mitigation and allowed the mitigation testimony. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Stat. 5/33B-1 et seq. (2000) were unconstitutional. The victim of the robbery testified on both direct and redirect examination that defendant used a knife in the attack and that she saw a knife. She specifically testified on redirect examination that she got a good look at the knife. Further, she identified an exhibit offered by the State as that knife. The appellate court held that the trial court properly admitted the knife. Regarding the sentencing, the maximum prison sentence for defendant's crime was 30 years, but since the trial court adjudged defendant a habitual criminal, he was sentenced to life. The appellate court held that in the context of a sentencing under the act, Apprendi did not require the fact of prior Class X convictions to be submitted to a fact finder and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brothers convicted in Madison County Circuit Court (Illinois) of murder and hijacking challenged the sufficiency of evidence and admissibility of certain evidence, and alleged prosecutorial misconduct, disparate sentencing of various participants in the scheme, and unconstitutional imposition of enhanced sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant twin brothers operated a hijacking scheme with two accomplices. After a hijacking ended in a brutal murder, one accomplice considered testifying against them, and eventually the other accomplice, courted by prosecutors, did. Despite his own checkered past, the accomplice received almost no jail time. The appeals court upheld defendants' convictions. The accomplice's uncorroborated testimony was sufficient to convict them, if the jury found him credible. The trial court's rulings on the admissibility of relevant evidence and keeping in check prosecutorial excesses were correct. The disparity in outcome for the four participants was logically related to their degrees of cooperation with the prosecution. The only issue on which defendants' appeal was successful was their constitutional challenge to the non-jury imposition of greater than maximum enhanced sentences based on the crime's brutality. The court modified one brother's sentence to the statutory maximum and remanded for resentencing of the less culpable brother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions, but modified one defendant's first-degree murder sentence and vacated the other defendant's sentence, remanding for resentencing in accordance with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence of Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois), imposed after vacation of a death sentence previously imposed, challenging, in particular, the imposition of extended-term and consecutive sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to murder and related offenses after shooting a hostage in a hold-up. His initial death sentence was vacated by the Supreme Court of Illinois. He appealed the sentenced imposed after remand, but the appeals court affirmed. It held that trial court after remand had properly considered only the murder conviction and sentence, because that was the only judgment vacated. The trial court had supported its findings of brutality and heinousness in determining that defendant was death eligible, and because it found those factors beyond reasonable doubt, a second finding was not required when the trial court sentenced defendant to an extended term in prison instead. That term was not beyond the statutory maximum, because the maximum sentence was death. However, imposition of consecutive sentences was improper, under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-4, because it resulted in more prison time than the original sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs state citizen and political watchdog organization sued defendants former state secretary of state (SOS), and now governor, his political committee, and certain SOS employees to, inter alia, impose a constructive trust on funds and benefits allegedly illegally received while the SOS was the SOS. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed the action. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, inter alia, alleged that defendants used the SOS's position to issue commercial drivers licenses to non-qualified drivers in exchange for political contributions. The dispositive issue was whether plaintiffs had standing to sue and thus whether the circuit court had jurisdiction. The appeals court agreed that plaintiffs did not have standing.  735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/20-104(b) (that provided a private citizen could sue to recover the damages authorized by 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/20-102 to 20-104 on behalf of the affected government unit) was declared unconstitutional to the extent it purported to confer standing. Section 5/20-104(b) conflicted with the inherent powers of the state attorney general as the proper person to direct the legal affairs of the state and to sue in cases where the state was the real party in interest. The appeals court stated that the Illinois Supreme Court had consistently held that the public interest was not served by allowing certain government agencies or private persons to assume the inherent powers of the attorney general. Dismissal was properly granted, so the courts declined to consider the merits of plaintiffs' claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder after a bench trial and was sentenced to consecutive terms.

The appellate court held that defendant's counsel was not ineffective based on the record before it. Because counsel had impeached a witness with inconsistent statements, he was not required to use the witness's earlier testimony as substantive evidence. In addition, because defendant was initially tried in a bench trial, there was no possibility of jury confusion. Defendant's sentences were each within the statutory range.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs, the president of a county board of commissioners and a registered voter, appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) that denied their motion for a preliminary injunction and granted the defendants', the regional transportation authority (RTA) and two of its divisions, motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs brought an action for injunctive and declaratory relief against the defendants alleging that certain provisions of the Regional Transportation Authority Act (RTA Act), 70 Ill. Comp. Stat. 3615/1.01 et seq., violated certain principles of the Illinois Constitution. On appeal, the plaintiffs argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by concluding that the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; guarantee embodied in Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and Ill. Const. art. III, &sect; 3 did not apply to appointed bodies, such as the RTA boards. Upon review, the appellate court reversed the judgment. The allegations of plaintiffs' complaint revealed that the directors were not appointed on the basis of one man-one-vote as required under 70 Ill. Comp. Stat. 3615/3.01(h) (1998). In light of traditional statutory construction, which ascribed meaning to all provisions of a statute, the appellate court found the trial court's analysis insufficient to dispose of the plaintiffs' action on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to an extended term of 80 years for the murder based on findings that the offense was accompanied by heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty, and it was committed against a person 60 years of age or older. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant waived the issue as to whether he was improperly denied a jury trial, because he did not raise the issue in a posttrial motion. The issue was not subject to plain error review. Although the age of the victim was not presented to the trier of fact as part of the indictment and subjected to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, any error was harmless, because a jury would have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of killing a 60 year old man.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated kidnapping after stealing a van that contained two children. Under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 150/2(B)(1.5) of the Illinois Sex Offender Registration Act aggravated kidnapping of children by a non-parent subjected him to registration as a sex offender. The appeals court held that the statute as applied did not violate defendant's due process rights, because it survived rational basis scrutiny. Inclusion of kidnapping, a common precursor to sexual violence against children, was rationally related to the statute's purpose of preventing violence against children. The statute, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 152/120, that made aggravated kidnapping a Class X felony, for which a long prison term could be imposed, was not invalid by reason of its enactment in 1989 Ill. Laws 707, which amended several different statutes. The single-subject rule of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d) was not violated because all the provisions dealt with criminal law.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held defendant had not demonstrated the trial court abused its discretion in failing to continue the dispositional hearing to obtain more information on suitable placement as the trial court clearly indicated that it had sufficient information to make its decision. It also held the trial court did not err in finding he was not an appropriate candidate for conditional release. Given the testimony of the three expert witnesses, the nature and circumstances of defendant's behavior, his prior and present mental condition, and what arrangements were available to ensure he had access to and would participate in necessary treatment, the trial court did not err in committing him to institutional care.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A grandmother obtained an order allowing visitation with her granddaughter pursuant to 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/607(b)(1), and maintained a successful contempt proceeding with an award of attorney fees when her former daughter-in-law refused to comply with it. Although the trial court erred in failing to rule on the grandmother's fitness, the mother waived that error by failing to appeal it. The mother's subsequent contempt for the order was evident on the record, and the fee award was not an abuse of discretion. The mother's constitutional challenges failed. The best interests standard was not unconstitutionally vague, because other Illinois statutes listed many factors for consideration in applying it. There was also no denial of due process protections of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, because the statute was narrowly drawn to reach only situations in which the State had a compelling interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen filed an action for false light after he was identified in a newspaper article as having been questioned in a recent rape case. The citizen twice voluntarily dismissed his case, and twice refiled it. The corporation moved to dismiss the claim on the grounds that the citizen's claim violated the single-refiling rule. After significant argument, the trial court certified the question for consideration by the appellate court. The appellate court was also asked to consider whether identification of the citizen as a suspect in a criminal case in newspaper articles could be innocently construed as true so as to bar a false light cause of action. The appellate court found that nothing in the article charged the citizen with the commission of a crime. The appellate court found further that the article did not state that the citizen was questioned as a suspect, nor did it imply a sinister motive to the interview. Finally, the appellate court found that the citizen's claim was barred because the state supreme court declared the statute allowing multiple re-filing of pleadings unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a Champaign County Circuit Court (Illinois) judgment on verdict convicting him of weapons offenses. He argued counsel ineffectiveness in failing to stipulate to prior convictions and in failing to move to vacate the unlawful use conviction, due process violations, and that one felony offense was really a misdemeanor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of weapons by a convicted felon and unlawful weapons use. The appeals court held, first, that his trial counsel had not been ineffective in failing to stipulate to defendant's prior convictions before the jury heard about them, because at that time, the State of Illinois was not required to accept stipulations which, in any case, defendant had not offered. Counsel was also not ineffective in failing to move to vacate the unlawful use conviction, because it was not a lesser-included offense of unlawful possession. There was no plain error in allowing jurors to find defendant guilty under an accountability theory, because he could also have been convicted under a constructive possession theory. Finally, the statute making unlawful use a felony instead of a misdemeanor was an amendment to a statute that had later been held unconstitutional. Therefore, a shorter sentence was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed most aspects of the judgment, but modified it to reduce defendant's felony conviction of unlawful weapons use to a misdemeanor, appropriately modified his sentence on that offense, and remanded for issuance of an amended judgment of sentence in accordance with its instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois Child Protection Division order changed the permanency goal for respondent mother's son to substitute care pending court determination on termination of parental rights pursuant to 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/2-28(3) (1998) of the Juvenile Court Act. The mother appealed. Petitioner State moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue presented in the appeal was whether 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/2-28(3) (1998) of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, which provided for immediate appeals from permanency orders as a matter of right pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 304(b)(1) violated the separation of powers clause found in Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 (1970). A circuit court's order setting a permanency goal was not final because it did not finally determine a right or status of a party but instead looked at the anticipated future status of the child. The portion of 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/2-28(3) that allowed a party to immediately appeal a nonfinal permanency order was unconstitutional because it unduly encroached upon the exclusive power of the Supreme Court of Illinois to regulate matters of appellate practice and procedure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) defendant was convicted of two counts of home invasion and four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault. He was sentenced to six years in prison for each aggravated criminal sexual assault, with the terms to run consecutively, and one year in prison for home invasion, to run concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant, who had attacked a woman in her apartment, argued that the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the second of the four charged sexual offenses because the victim's testimony as to the second alleged sexual offense did not prove the element of penetration. Under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-12(f) (1998), &quot;penetration&quot; did not require physical penetration but merely contact. The victim testified that defendant exposed both her sexual organ and his own and, then, while she was face up and he was on top of her with his knees on either side of her, he tried to put his penis in her while he was choking her. The appellate court held that based on such testimony a rational trier of fact could have found that the elements of aggravated criminal sexual assault, including sexual penetration by way of contact, were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant also argued that Apprendi required his sentences to run concurrently because he was not afforded a jury determination of the aggravating factors used to enhance his sentence. The appellate court found no sentencing error because Apprendi did not apply to consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder and was sentenced to prison. The trial court dismissed defendant's post-conviction petition and denied his motion for reconsideration. On appeal, defendant argued he was not culpably negligent in filing his post-conviction petition late because of his reliance on his counsel's advice. The State responded that defendant's petition was properly dismissed because defendant's assertions that he was not culpably negligent were insufficient as a matter of law under Rissley, in which the court rejected reliance on advice of counsel as a sufficient excuse to negate culpable negligence for delay in filing. The appellate court agreed with the State. The appellate court determined that defendant's post-conviction petition was untimely filed pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1(c). Further, the court noted that under Rissley, a petitioner was responsible for the errors of his counsel which resulted in a late filing. Accordingly, a petitioner could not claim that he was not culpably negligent because his petition was filed late due to his counsel's mistakes rather than his personal mistakes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reduced the length of defendant's sentence to four years after hearing defendant's motion to reconsider his sentence, but reiterated its order that defendant serve his sentences consecutively. The appellate court held that (1) the only true factual inquiry involved in &sect; 5-5-3.2(b)(1) was whether defendant had a prior conviction of at least the same or similar class felony within the previous 10 years and, because defendant's prior conviction was not an essential element of the underlying offense and was unrelated to that offense, the imposition of an extended term sentence was not unconstitutional; and (2) the imposition of a discretionary consecutive sentence under &sect; 5-8-4(b) did not violate defendant's rights to due process and a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sheriff's deputy observed defendant driving over the speed limit and running off the side of the road and then back onto the road. By the time the deputy caught up with and stopped defendant, they had crossed over the line into a different county. The deputy noticed that defendant smelled of alcohol. When defendant got out of the car, the deputy saw a bag sticking out of defendant's pants at the waist, which defendant admitted contained drugs. After arriving at the county correctional facility with the deputy, defendant refused a field sobriety test and blood testing. The deputy cited defendant for, inter alia, driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol. The deputy failed to notify officials of the other county of the arrest of defendant. Defendant argued this failure invalidated his arrest and entitled him to a rescission of his statutory summary suspension. Although the deputy was obligated to notify the officials of the other county of the arrest pursuant to 725 Ill. Com. Stat. 5/107-4(a-7)(2000), the court held that an otherwise valid arrest could not be invalidated for a lack of notice of that arrest to another law enforcement agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possessing a look-alike substance in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570/404(b), an offense for which fines were potentially higher than for offenses involving controlled substances, within 1,000 feet of a school, which called for heightened penalties under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570/407(b)(3). This offense was not probationable under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3(c)(2)(D). Despite this potential for greater punishment, the appeals court held that these statutes did not violate the due process guarantees of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. An earlier version of the statute creating the look-alike substance offense articulated two constitutionally permissible rationales for the penalties, and these rationales continued to justify successor statutes' application, and application of related statutes, to defendant. Defendant's challenge to sufficiency of the evidence was meritless; looked at in the context of drug transactions, the evidence was more than adequate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, insurance companies, sued defendants, insurance director and state treasurer, alleging they were subject to an unconstitutional tax. Earlier, the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed that the tax was unconstitutional and remanded the case. On remand, the defendants asserted the pass-on defense. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) ruled that the pass-on defense applied and certified four questions for interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Insurance companies did business in Illinois but were incorporated in other states. The suit challenged a tax that was imposed on foreign insurers. At trial after the initial remand, defendants for the first time raised the pass-on defense, which stated that in order to be entitled to a tax refund, the insurance companies were required to show that they bore the burden of the tax and did not pass it on to their policyholders, thereby receiving a windfall. The certified questions were: (1) whether the pass-on defense applied as a matter of law, (2) whether the plaintiffs had the burden of establishing that they bore the burden of the tax and did not receive a windfall, (3) whether defendants waived the issue of windfall, and (4) whether further proceedings were required with respect to the amount of the windfall. The appellate court found that there was a general policy against unjust enrichment through the refund of illegal taxes and the proper party to recover a tax illegally exacted was the person actually bearing the burden of the tax. The pass on defense applied, and was a refund issue properly considered, and initially raised, at the remedy phase of an action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed. The certified questions were answered as follows: (1) The &quot;pass-on defense&quot; applied, (2) since the pass-on defense was raised by the defendants, the insurance companies had the burden of establishing that there was no windfall, (3) the issue of windfall was remedial and thus not waived, and (4) further proceedings were appropriate with respect to determining the amount of windfall.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A forest preserve district passed an ordinance which authorized the district's executive director, his staff, and the district's attorneys to enter into negotiations for the acquisition of property owned by a family trust. When negotiations failed, the district passed a second ordinance which authorized the executive director, his staff, and the district's attorneys to &quot;take necessary steps, either by negotiation or condemnation,&quot; to acquire the land. The appellate court held that, because it did not vest the district's staff with the power to determine the political propriety of condemning the property, but merely authorized the staff to effectuate an already approved condemnation action or to negotiate further with the property owner within definite guidelines set by the district, the second ordinance was not an improper delegation of the power of eminent domain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was charged with making a false report and insurance fraud after he reported the theft of a vehicle to police and allegedly filed a claim for loss with his insurance company. Evidence showed that he obtained paper title to an automobile owned by someone else, that he registered and insured the vehicle, that he reported the vehicle stolen, and that his insurance company received a claim for theft and issued a check in the defendant's name. The trial court acquitted the defendant of insurance fraud because the prosecution failed to prove that the defendant submitted the claim to his insurance company or that he cashed the company's check. The appellate court held that (1) the legislature supplied knowledge, and not criminal knowledge (i.e., knowledge plus criminal purpose), as the mental state for a violation of 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/4-103(a)(6); (2) the evidence was sufficient to uphold the defendant's conviction for false reporting; but (3) the trial court improperly ordered the defendant to pay restitution under 730 Ill.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents sought additional visitation rights with their grandchildren after their son passed away. The mother wanted supervised visitation of the children, because she witnessed the grandfather shower with the oldest child, who was born in 1995. The trial court found that all the parties were responsible, moral, and caring people. The mother did not object to visitation, but only requested supervised visitation.  750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/607(b)(1) permitted a court to grant visitation to the grandparents. The mother's right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her children was a fundamental right. Section 607(b)(1) did not satisfy strict scrutiny, because the mother was fit to parent, the mother did not seek to terminate visitation, and the trial court failed to give special weight to the mother's determination of her children's best interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Circuit Court of Macon County (Illinois) convicted defendant of home invasion, armed robbery, and armed violence, 720 Ill. Comp. Stats. 5/12-11, 18-2(a), 33A-2. The trial court sentenced him to 45 years in prison for armed violence, 25 years for home invasion, and 25 years for armed robbery, with all sentences to run concurrently. The trial court denied defendant's motion to reconsider, and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he inflicted great bodily harm upon the victim, that the truth-in-sentencing provision in 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3(a)(2)(iii) was unconstitutional pursuant to the Apprendi doctrine, and other errors. The victim testified that after breaking into her house, the defendant tried to intimidate her into giving him money or drugs. Defendant then beat the victim with a gun, and choked her. The victim was treated for lacerations, and suffered bruises. The victim testified that she had scars and damage to one of her hands from the beating. The court held this provided sufficient evidence to support the finding that defendant inflicted great bodily harm under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/12-4(a). The appellate court held that the Apprendi doctrine did not render 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/3-6-3(a)(2)(iii)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The trial court's finding that defendant's conduct leading to his convictions resulted in great bodily harm did not increase the maximum penalty. Instead, the finding of great bodily harm simply had an impact upon the amount of time by which defendant could decrease his sentence.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner's claims that his consecutive sentences were unconstitutional or were otherwise imposed in error were not cognizable under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/10-124.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client was charged with a multiple homicide. The law firm represented him along with another defendant, claiming there was no conflict of interest. The client was convicted. After years of appeals, it was determined a conflict of interest did exist in the law firm's representation of the client. The client's conviction was overturned. Approximately 20 months after his release the client filed suit. The appellate court held the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the client's conviction was overturned since the damages were speculative until a final mandate was issued. However, the client's suit was barred by the six year statute of repose. Since, the repose statute was enacted after the alleged malpractice and the period would have expired prior to the statute's enactment, the client had six years from the date the repose statute was enacted in which to file suit. The repose statute was constitutional as there was a legitimate state interest in limiting the time in which suits could be brought.</SPAN></P>

His conviction of aggravated criminal sexual assault fell within the second of the named exceptions to the consecutive sentencing bar in 730 Ill. Comp.

The jurors indicated they could keep an open mind and were not confused about the burden of proof. Minor equivocations were rehabilitated. Because defendant's intent to kill the rival gang member was clearly established, that intent was transferable to the injured victims. The trial court did not have to hold a hearing on the alleged ineffectiveness of counsel when there was no clear basis for the allegation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) entered an order, which: (1) granted appellee wife's petition for interim attorney's fees under &sect; 501(c-1) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/501(c-1); and (2) held appellant husband in civil contempt and subjected him to a term of incarceration for refusing to pay $ 19,000 in attorney's fees to the wife, in violation of the court order. The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the husband contended that the circuit court was without statutory authority to award interim attorney's fees under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/501(c-1), because 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/501(c-1) applied exclusively to pre-dissolution decree proceedings. In the alternative, the husband contended that the application of 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/501(c-1) was unconstitutional, and that the wife's petition for interim attorney's fees was insufficient to support an interim fee award. The appellate court held, first, that the plain language of 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/501(c-1) was unambiguous, and that the legislature intended 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/501(c-1) to apply in post-decree proceedings. Second, because 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/501(c-1) did not foreclose the opportunity of an evidentiary hearing, but still allowed for a hearing where good cause was shown, it did not violate procedural due process. Finally, it was not an abuse of discretion for the circuit court to grant the interim fee award to the wife, in view of the uncontradicted representations concerning the husband's ability to pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order compelling the husband to pay interim attorney's fees was affirmed. The order of contempt against the husband was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of murder and death sentence were affirmed. He then petitioned for postconviction relief claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) dismissed defendant's petition regarding the guilt-innocence phase without an evidentiary hearing, but held a new sentencing hearing and sentenced him to life in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that where a defendant took a direct appeal, the judgment of the reviewing court was res judicata as to all issues actually decided by the court, and any other claims that could have been presented, if not presented, were waived. The waiver rule could have been relaxed where the evidentiary basis for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim was outside the record or was newly discovered, but the record contained information upon which a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel could have been made on direct appeal. Thus, that claim was waived. In any event, defendant failed to show either that his representation fell below a standard of reasonableness, or that the claimed ineffective assistance so harmed him that the result would have been different. There was nothing to indicate that a motion to suppress filed would have been successful, so it could not be said that defendant was harmed by the failure to file such a motion. Defendant waived his claims of error regarding sentencing by failing to file a written motion following his resentencing. The lower court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sentence, so there was no plain error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a partner robbed a used-car dealership and shot two people. A jury in the Circuit Court of St. Clair County (Illinois) found defendant guilty of armed robbery, two counts of aggravated battery, and two counts of attempted murder. Upon finding that defendant was a habitual criminal, the trial court imposed life duration as punishment pursuant to 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/33B-1. Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 33B-1, which empowered the trial judge to impose life imprisonment based on the fact that defendant had two prior convictions of a certain classification, was unconstitutional. He argued that, pursuant to the rule of Apprendi, the facts that mandated his punishment had to be alleged in the charging instrument and submitted to the jury. Specifically, he argued that &sect; 33B-1 was unconstitutional because a State officer rather than the jury determined that the requisite prior convictions existed and because that finding was not made under a reasonable doubt standard. The appellate court found that &sect; 33B-1 was not unconstitutional because, under the rule of Apprendi, the fact of a prior conviction was not the type of fact that had to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt in order to increase the penalty for a crime beyond the usual statutory maximum. Accordingly, defendant's prior convictions, which were not elements of the later crimes, did not have to be alleged in the charging document, submitted to the jury, or proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to be the basis for enhancing his punishment. The sentence was valid.</SPAN></P>

The disabled mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disabled mother was adjudicated disabled under the Illinois Probate Act of 1975, 755 Ill. Comp.

At the subsequent hearings, the juvenile court judge chose to proceed despite being advised that the plenary guardian was neither named in the petitions nor served with notice of the motions. The appellate court held that the order adjudicating the child a ward of the court was void for lack of jurisdiction. The plenary guardian was a necessary party to the proceedings under 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/2-22, however, he was neither named in the wardship petition nor served notice of the proceedings. Therefore, the disabled mother was deprived of due process in the exercise of her rights under 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/1-5(1). Due process dictated that the plenary guardian was equally a necessary party to the termination proceedings, and he was neither named as a party in, nor served notice of, those proceedings.

Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-2(a)(1), 5-5-3.2(b) (1998). Defendant claimed that his 100 year sentence was unconstitutional, because the sentence was beyond the statutory maximum, requiring the trial court to submit to the jury the question of whether the murder was exceptionally brutal. The trial court was not required to submit the exceptionally brutal question to the jury, because the maximum sentence in a first degree murder case was natural life in prison. In addition, the statute used to impose an extended-term sentence upon defendant involved a consideration of the evidence regarding the particular offense in question after he was tried on the elements of that offense. Therefore, no new evidence was considered by the trial court in sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery and a hate crime after he and another yelled racial slurs at the victim and hit him with their car. He was sentenced to consecutive prison terms. His motion for a new trial was denied, and he appealed. The appellate court held that even though no probable cause was found for the hate crime at the preliminary hearing, the State could subsequently seek and obtain an indictment for it. Since the testimony at the preliminary hearing was not knowingly false, it was not perjured. The State was not obligated to tell the grand jury that the testimony was hearsay. Since both charges resulted from defendant's act of hitting the victim with his car, the lesser charge had to be vacated. The evidence at trial sufficiently supported and proved the charges against him. Consecutive sentencing was proper since defendant had prior unrelated convictions.</SPAN></P>

The administrator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient and the decedent were involved in an automobile collision. The decedent died of the injuries he sustained in the accident. The decedent's estate was being administered by the administrator. The issue in the pending arbitration proceeding (proceeding) between the administrator and the patient's liability insurer was the patient's sobriety at the time of the accident. The administrator contended that the patient's medical records should be discoverable in the proceeding. The appellate court held that the physician-patient privilege (privilege) was not waived, and that the patient's medical records were not available to the administrator. The proceeding did not fall within the exception to the privilege set forth in 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/8-802(4), because it was not brought by the patient, his representative, or his beneficiary. The patient, who was not a party in the proceeding, did not waive the privilege merely because he previously made a claim against the decedent's estate. The patient's medical records were protected by the privilege even though the result was to bar information about the patient's sobriety at the time of the accident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove to a correctional facility to visit an inmate and he followed a guard's instructions when he parked his car on facility grounds. Defendant locked his car and was walking towards the visitors' entrance when a guard asked if he could search defendant's car. Defendant gave his consent to search and the guard discovered a paper bag in the back of defendant's car with four unopened cans of beer inside the bag. The appellate court noted a prior precedent that equated bringing items of contraband into a prison with bringing those items onto prison grounds, but also noted that the legislature had greatly expanded the list of items identified as contraband and had amended the definition of &quot;penal institution&quot; since that case was decided, and held that, as amended, the statute used to convict defendant did not prohibit possession of contraband in areas not dedicated to captivity. The court also held that a broader reading of the statute would present a serious question of constitutionality because most people of common intelligence would not think to empty items that are routinely kept in a car, but which are defined as contraband under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed by an officer walking the same section of a street several days in a row in a high drug activity area. The officer stopped defendant and asked if he had any illegal substances and defendant handed over a bag of crack cocaine. At the time he approached defendant, the officer had not observed defendant committing a crime and defendant did not appear about to commit a crime. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence because it was obtained in an illegal seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress because the officer had observed defendant's behavior for two to three days and knew the area to be a high drug-trafficking area. The officer's suspicion that defendant had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime, specifically, trafficking in unlawful drugs, was reasonable. Defendant argued that the appellate court should reverse his conviction because the only evidence that he possessed drugs was a lab report. Defendant forfeited this argument by failing to challenge the admissibility of the lab report at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was in jail at the time of the crimes, was convicted as a result of calling elderly women from jail, pretending to be a relative, and asking them to wire him money. At trial evidence of three other prison telephone scams with the same modus operandi were admitted. The appellate court held the other crimes were overwhelmingly similar to the crimes for which defendant was charged and there was a resulting logical inference that the same person committed both the charged and uncharged offenses. Therefore, the probative value of the evidence outweighed the risk of unfair prejudice. The appellate court also held the evidence was not so unreasonable, improbable, or unsatisfactory as to leave doubt of defendant's guilt. The appellate court did vacate the reimbursement order, as no appointed-counsel hearing had been held, and it vacated the $ 20 fine imposed by the clerk. Finally, it affirmed his extended-term sentence, finding that although the jury was not asked to rule on whether the victim was over 60, since the witness testified she was 93 the error was harmless. In addition, defendant's sentence was predicated upon a prior offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court, Cook County (Illinois) which convicted defendant of armed robbery, armed violence, aggravated kidnapping, and aggravated battery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction, defendant was sentenced to 50 years imprisonment. On appeal, defendant contended that (1) he was denied due process because the State failed to tender material prior to trial relating to the victim's immigration status and any pending investigations by Immigration and Naturalization Services; (2) defendant's trial counsel was ineffective for failing to uncover the victim's immigration file prior to trial; (3) the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to consecutive sentences because 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a) was unconstitutional, and (4) he was improperly sentenced on the charge of armed violence. The appellate court found that it was reasonably probable that the outcome of neither the trial nor the sentencing hearing would have been different had defendant had additional information regarding the victim's immigration status. However, it was unclear from the record whether the trial court considered the increased minimum of 15 years' imprisonment when sentencing defendant, and whether that minimum had any impact, whatsoever, on the trial court's decision to sentence defendant to 25 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part as to the conviction of defendant. Defendant's sentence, however, was vacated to provide the trial court an opportunity to affirm that it sentenced defendant in accordance with current law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the imposition of consecutive sentences by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for first degree murder of one victim and second degree murder of another victim. Defendant asserted &sect; 5-8-4(a) of the Unified Code of Corrections, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-4(a) (1998) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended defendant had waived the issue of &sect; 5-8-4(a)'s constitutionality because he did not challenge the charging instrument prior to the conclusion of his trial or challenge his sentence in a postsentencing motion. The appellate court held a party could challenge the constitutionality of a statute at any time. It also held Apprendi concerns were not implicated by consecutive sentencing, as consecutive sentences remained discrete and therefore a determination that sentences were to be served consecutively could not run afoul of Apprendi, which only addressed sentences for individual crimes. Thus, &sect; 5-8-4(a) of the code passed constitutional muster. Defendant's sentences which ran consecutively to each other were not transformed into a single sentence, but were discrete sentences each within the statutory range established by the legislature. None of the penalties for any of the individual sentences had been increased. Accordingly, there was no Apprendi violation.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of La Salle County (Illinois) granted a motion to dismiss filed by state supreme court and supreme court justice. Employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Employee alleged that after she began work for state supreme court, her promised salary was reduced. Employee's count against supreme court justice alleged that he directed her salary reduction in furtherance of his bias against her as an older employee, a female, and as a former employee of a political rival. The appellate court held that the State Lawsuit Immunity Act, 745 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/1 et seq. (Act), provided that the court of claims was the exclusive forum for lawsuits against the state. As the alleged acts of supreme court justice arose out of his duties as a state employee, the claim against him was also governed by the Act. Although a claim of malice could have been brought in the circuit court, employee had not pled the specific facts needed to take her claim outside of the scope of sovereign immunity. Employee's age and gender discrimination claims were civil rights violations and thus preempted by the Illinois Human Rights Act, which provided an exclusive remedy before the Illinois Human Rights Commission. Finally, the trial court did not err in denying employee's request to amend her complaint, as even after the amendment no cause of action could be stated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's arraignment was conducted without objection by closed circuit television. Upon the convictions, the trial court imposed consecutive sentences totaling 59 years. The issues on appeal were whether (1) the closed circuit television arraignment procedure violated due process, (2) the trial court mistakenly believed that consecutive sentences were mandated for all three offenses, and (3) the consecutive sentence imposed for home invasion was an unconstitutional violation of Apprendi. The appellate court found that since defendant did not object to the use of the arraignment procedure, he was obligated to show plain error on appeal. The appellate court did not find that the closed circuit procedure prejudiced defendant or impaired any substantial rights, so there was no plain error. Based on review of the record, the appellate court found that the trial court imposed consecutive sentences for residential burglary and home invasion pursuant to its discretionary authority under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5-8-4(b). Finally, the appellate court held that the consecutive sentencing provided for in 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5-8-4(b) did not violate the rule of the Apprendi case.</SPAN></P>

Because defendant failed to object to her testimony at trial or to raise the issue in his post-trial motion, he waived it on appeal. The child was not required to testify at the reliability hearing, only at trial. The consecutive sentences were constitutional since the trial judge made no factual determinations. In addition, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-8-5 mandated consecutive sentences if one of the charges against involved sexual abuse of a child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant forced his former co-worker (victim) into a secluded place and raped her. The trial court admitted victim's mother's prior statements to police. Although the content of this statement went beyond the scope of the exception for early reports of rape, the appeals court found no plain error, because there was so much corroborating evidence. Therefore, counsel was not ineffective in failing to object. The offense of forcing victim into an area where her cries could not be heard was sufficiently separate from the assault to constitute kidnapping, which was properly used to upgrade defendant's offense to aggravated criminal sexual assault. Finally, defendant's prior conviction of the same offense was properly the basis for imposing a statutory term of imprisonment for defendant's natural life because prior convictions were the exception to the rule that aggravating circumstances affecting sentences had to be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. There was enough corroborative evidence to negate erroneous admission of evidence, kidnapping of victim was a separate aggravating circumstance, and prior convictions were the exception to the rule that aggravating circumstances had to be proven to support sentence increases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary and given an enhanced sentence based on two prior convictions. Defendant contended his enhanced sentence was unconstitutional because the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the prior felony convictions that were the basis of the enhanced sentence. Defendant's presentence report showed two prior convictions for burglary. At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor informed the court that defendant was eligible for an enhanced sentence based on those two convictions. The enhanced sentence did not violate defendant's right to due process because the state did not prove the basis for the enhancement, his prior convictions, beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court noted that prior convictions are typically undisputed matters of record and requiring the state to prove prior convictions at trial would greatly prejudice the defendant with little corresponding benefit. The presentence report was all that was necessary to establish defendant's eligibility for an enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>

The facts upon which the trial court relied to increase defendant's murder sentence were never charged in the first-degree murder count, nor were the extended-term facts submitted to the jury in the instructions.

This sentencing scheme violated the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription of the deprivation of liberty without due process of law and the Sixth Amendment's right to trial by jury.

Part of the taxpayers' complaint alleged that 73 taxing districts accumulated improper surpluses. The Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois) granted defendants', state and municipalities, motion to dismiss as to some funds, and approved the parties' stipulation setting forth the amount of tax to be refunded. Plaintiffs appealed the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court dismissed the taxpayers' claims alleging unlawful accumulation of surplus funds in firemen's pension funds, policemen's pension funds, the Illinois Retirement Fund, Social Security, and Medicare, and in the levies of two home-rule municipalities. The municipalities also moved to reconsider and for leave to file a motion to dismiss the motion for leave to file an amended notice of appeal. The appellate court held that the taxpayers' motion to file an amended notice of appeal was untimely. The appellate court held the trial court properly dismissed the claims of unlawful accumulation of surplus funds in police and firefighter's pension funds. General rules prohibiting unnecessary accumulation did not apply when a statute authorized accumulation, and the accumulations were justified to account for unfunded accrued liability as required state law, 40 Ill. Comp. Stats. 5/3-125, 5/4-118. The trial court also properly dismissed the claims against home-rule municipalities, because the home-rule municipalities could exercise the power to tax, and no statutory limitations on the taxing power applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State filed a petition for adjudication of wardship of the appellant mother's four children. Following an adjudicatory hearing, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Child Protection Division (Illinois), found the allegations of abuse and neglect proven, and held a dispositional hearing. The trial court adjudged the children wards of the court. Mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mother had not been personally served with notice of the hearing and was not present, although she was in court when the hearing was scheduled and her attorney was given notice of the hearing. The petition alleged that one of the children had been born with cocaine in his system, while the evidence at the hearing showed it was in fact a different child. On appeal, mother argued that the trial court should have been reversed because: (1) there was lack of proper notice of the hearing, (2) the evidence of the drug exposed child was different than that alleged in the petition, and (3) the finding of abuse was erroneous since the relevant incident was an accident. The appellate court found that mother had been given actual notice of the hearing in the prior court proceeding and her constitutional challenge to the notice provisions had been waived. The defect in the name of the drug-exposed child had been waived as well, but neglect toward one child could be taken as evidence of an injurious environment for the child's siblings. Finally, even if the incident in question was an accident, it could have, in conjunction with other evidence, supported a finding of abuse.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to driving while license revoked, and was sentenced to probation. Plaintiff State sought to revoke probation, alleging that defendant tested positive for drugs. Defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude from a probation revocation hearing the results of a urine test by means of a certified laboratory report. The Circuit Court of Christian County (Illinois) granted the motion, and plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The probation order contained a provision stating that the results of drug testing were admissible in any proceeding to revoke the probation. Defendant argued that admission of the laboratory test results was hearsay, and that the waiver she signed in the probation order was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that at a probation revocation hearing, the State had the burden of going forward with the evidence and proving the violation of probation by a preponderance of the evidence, while using only competent evidence. Hearsay evidence was not competent evidence in probation revocation proceedings. The court held that the waiver in the probation order was not provided by statute. The appellate court held that defendant did not knowingly waive her right to confront the witnesses against her at a probation revocation proceeding. The appellate court held that the waiver condition of probation was outside the range of permissible conditions, absent a voluntary and knowing waiver. Therefore, plaintiff was required to introduce the urine test results by means other than introducing any written or printed laboratory result from a certified laboratory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated battery with a firearm and aggravated battery. He moved for acquittal or a new trial. His counsel withdrew because he was uncooperative. Defendant alleged ineffective assistance of counsel because no fitness hearing had been requested. The trial court found defendant fit for both sentencing and trial. The appellate court agreed because defendant understood the charges against him, participated in his defense, and recalled details about the trial. Because defendant failed to raise doubts as to his fitness to stand trial, he also failed to show that trial counsel's performance was unreasonable. Charges resulting from a single act were to be sentenced according to the most serious offense.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court, Will County (Illinois), which convicted defendant of unlawful possession of a look-alike substance with intent to distribute on public housing property in violation of 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 570/404(b), 407(b)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction, defendant appealed contending (1) his trial counsel was ineffective for not challenging his arrest on probable cause grounds, (2) his conviction should be reduced to simple possession, and (3) 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/5-5-3(c)(8), under which he was sentenced, was unconstitutional. Defendant's conviction stemmed from a substance found in his pocket during a search incident to an arrest. The appellate court found that the defendant did not establish the prejudice required to sustain his ineffectiveness claim. The circumstances supported a finding of probable cause. As such, there was no reasonable likelihood that a motion to quash his arrest for a lack of probable cause would have been granted. Further, the evidence seized from defendant consisted of 58 small bags containing a white rocklike substance. In light of that evidence, a reduction of the defendant's conviction to simple possession was not warranted. Finally, defendant's prior convictions were reliable sentencing enhancement factors because they were entered in proceedings where he received due process protections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal of the denial, by the Marion County Circuit Court (Illinois), of his petition for post-conviction relief, petitioner added a claim that imposition of a greater than maximum sentence, upon the sentencing court's findings of brutality and heinousness of the murder committed, violated the constitutional rule articulated in Apprendi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder. The longest prison sentence that could be imposed without special findings was 60 years, but the trial court imposed a 75-year sentence upon finding brutality and heinousness. While petitioner's unsuccessful post-conviction relief petition was awaiting review, he added a claim that his sentence was invalid pursuant to Apprendi, the constitutional rule that guaranteed a defendant's right to a jury determination of guilt beyond reasonable doubt of every fact (except prior convictions) that increased his penalties. In the face of divided case law in its Illinois appellate district, the court reviewing dismissal of petitioner's claims considered whether the new rule fell within the narrow exception to the general rule of non-retroactivity in collateral proceedings reserved for watershed rules of criminal procedure. It determined that Apprendi fell within the exception, and that petitioner's sentence was invalid. The court therefore modified his sentence to run 60 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed dismissal of defendant's original claims as frivolous, but agreed that the new constitutional rule applied retroactively to petitioner, and modified his sentence to the longest sentence that could have been imposed without an enhancement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for murder, attempted murder, and aggravated discharge of a firearm by the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) objecting to the imposition of consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder, attempted murder, and aggravated discharge of a firearm. The trial court ordered consecutive sentences. It based its decision on its findings that defendant had committed a Class X felony, the offenses were part of a single course of conduct, and defendant had inflicted severe bodily injury. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to reconsider the sentences. The appellate court found ample evidence to support a guilty verdict. Even if there was not enough evidence for a jury instruction on accountability, the error was harmless. Because the State failed to properly apportion the gunshots into a separate count of aggravated discharge of a firearm, and because it was a less serious offense, defendant's conviction of aggravated discharge of a firearm had to be vacated. Consecutive sentences did not extend the convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction of aggravated discharge of a firearm was vacated. All other convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of the 21st Judicial Circuit (Illinois), Kankakee County, which summarily dismissed defendant's pro se petition for postconviction relief as frivolous and without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of home invasion. The trial court dismissed defendant's petition for postconviction relief. On appeal, the appellate court noted the sole issue was whether 1983 Ill. Laws 83-942, which amended the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/122-1 et seq. (1998), violated the single subject clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d) (1970). The appellate court noted that another single subject challenge to 1983 Ill. Laws 83-942 had been rejected. The appellate court noted that another appellate court had found all seven sections of 1983 Ill. Laws 83-942 concerned criminal law or the administration of criminal justice. Therefore, it ruled that all of the provisions had a natural and logical connection to a legitimate single subject-the criminal justice system. Accordingly, the appellate court concluded the prior opinion upholding the constitutionality of 1983 Ill. Laws 83-942 was soundly reasoned, and the stated subject and the separate provisions of 1983 Ill. Laws 83-942 withstood &quot;single subject&quot; analysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon notice of impending discharge, plaintiff teacher sought a 105 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/34-85 (1998) dismissal hearing, prevailed therein, but was terminated by defendant education board anyway. Plaintiff sued for administrative review, mandamus, and declaratory and injunctive relief in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois); and won remand, then reinstatement. Defendants, including State Board of Education and administrators, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, belatedly, paid a theatre and restaurant some field trip costs, and a police officer alleged gambling took place in his classroom. The dismissal hearing officer, which found for plaintiff, gave him due process in a hearing with cross-examination, and submitted a well-reasoned detailed 13 page report with factual findings and legal analysis. In contrast, defendant board, which found against plaintiff, produced an unsigned, undated, uncaptioned half page conclusory document with an out-of-synch certification, and did not indicate that it conferred with the hearing officer. Plaintiff won in circuit court. The appellate court held that as credibility was the determining factor, as defendant Chicago School Reform Board of Trustees of the Board of Education for the City of Chicago had final termination authority under &sect; 5/34-85, and as defendant board had reversed all the hearing officer's credibility findings, it should have conferred with him. Although the statute was ambiguous and contained mistakes, which the appellate court corrected, the legislative intent was clear.</SPAN></P>
