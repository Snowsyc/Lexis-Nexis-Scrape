</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals found no error in the denial of defendant's motion to suppress. An officer who was investigating an altercation between defendant and another individual did not exceed the level of force permissible under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7 during an investigatory stop. When the officer arrived, he faced a difficult and dangerous challenge. The scene was dark, and the officer was not able to tell if others, besides defendant and the other individual in the altercation, were present. The situation worsened when the officer saw defendant toss aside a guitar case and defendant told the officer that there was an unsecured shotgun at the scene. The officer drew his gun and ordered defendant and the other individual to lie face down on the ground and waited less than a minute for another officer to arrive. The court also held that defendant was not in custody during a patrol car interview, and therefore that U.S. Const. amend. V did not require suppression of his statements. The officer explicitly told defendant that he was not under arrest and asked whether defendant wanted to sit in the back of the patrol car because it was cold.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction, reversed the trial court's denial of a portion of defendant's presentence confinement credit, and remanded with directions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into an agreement to conduct an oil shale research and development project on the property, which they jointly owned. An amended provision gave the buyer an option to purchase the seller's interest in the property. After the buyer attempted to exercise the option more than 21 years later, the seller contended that it was unenforceable. The trial court found that the option violated the common law rule against perpetuities because it named no life in being and could be exercised more than 21 years after the parties entered into the amendment. The trial court further found that although the buyer had breached some of its duties under the agreement, the breaches were not material. The court concluded that the record supported the trial court's finding that the breaches were not material because the oil shale industry had become unprofitable. Reformation of the option was authorized under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15-11-1106(2) (2009), which was not limited to probate instruments. The application of &sect; 15-11-1106(2) was not unconstitutionally retrospective. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the seller's unclean hands defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff licensee appealed an order of the District Court of the City and County of Denver, Colorado, upholding the nonrenewal of its hotel and restaurant liquor license by defendant city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the city's director of excise and licenses abused her discretion by applying a strict liability standard for violations of the Colorado Liquor Code. Each provision of the Code cited by the director as a violation by the licensee, which formed the basis for good cause not to renew, contains the word &quot;permit,&quot; which requires some level of knowledge, rather than strict liability. There was no competent evidence in the record to establish that the licensee had actual or constructive knowledge of an undercover narcotics transaction inside the premises. However, there was competent evidence concerning the regular presence of overserved, intoxicated patrons loitering in front of the establishment in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-901(5)(a) (2009). The licensee did not dispute incidents of serving underage customers in violation of &sect; 12-47-901(1)(a.5). The court rejected the licensee's argument that the renewal process under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-302 (2009) is parallel to the sanction process under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-47-601 (2009). It also rejected the licensee's argument that &sect; 12-47-302 is unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed as to the findings of serving underage customers and intoxicated patrons but was otherwise reversed, and the case was remanded to the district court with orders to remand to the director for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a first degree murder case, the State appealed an order of the Arapahoe County District Court, Colorado, excluding the testimony of defendant's sister under Colo. R. Evid. 807, the residual exception to the rule against hearsay. As a result of that order, the case was dismissed at the prosecution's request. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sister testified that their mother had told her that defendant had confessed to killing his wife. The State wanted to appeal an evidentiary ruling of a kind other than that allowed under the interlocutory appeal provisions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-12-102(2) (2009) and Colo. App. R. 4.1. The appellate court concluded that lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The trial court's granting of the State's request for dismissal of the case did not constitute a final judgment from which an appeal of a question of law could be taken under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-12-102(1). The State's remedy, if any, from the trial court's evidentiary ruling lay in an original proceeding, brought pursuant to Colo. App. R. 21 in the Colorado Supreme Court prior to any dismissal of the case. The State unsuccessfully attempted that route. Because the State was not entitled to review from the appellate court, the appeal was subject to dismissal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Clear Creek County District Court, Colorado, denied appellant father's Colo. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion for relief from the March 25, 2009, order terminating his parental rights after the child's birth mother relinquished custody of the child pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-5-103.5 (2009). The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that he was denied due process when the district court declined to consider his request for relief from the termination of his parental rights. The appellate court did not have to consider his argument that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-5-105(4) (2009) was unconstitutional on its face because he did not make it in the district court. It could consider his contention that applying the ninety-day limitations period set forth in &sect; 19-5-105(4)&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived him of due process in the circumstances of the case. The appellate court found that the statute should not be interpreted so as to bar a due process challenge to the termination of a parent's rights when the parent alleged a lack of notice or insufficient notice of the proceedings resulting from the other parent's failure to refusal to identify him as a possible parent. Nothing the father did or did not do deprived him of the right to be given notice that the mother had initiated a proceeding in which his parental rights could be terminated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded for a hearing on the father's motion for relief from the order terminating his parental rights.</SPAN></P>

The organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization argued that, because the patient copy rule did not comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the trial court erred in entering summary judgment for the Board and against the organization. The appellate court noted that because HIPAA was not in effect until 2003, the Board's 2001 rule amending the patient copy rule was not subject to HIPAA's rules regarding copying patient records. When HIPAA took effect in 2003, the portion of the 2001 rule that applied to HIPAA-covered individuals was required to come into compliance with HIPAA. The Board's proposed amendment did not show that the copy fees charged to HIPAA-covered persons were cost-based and excluded ancillary costs. Because the General Assembly used the phrase &quot;payment of the reasonable costs,&quot; Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 25-1-801(1)(b)(I) and 25-1-802(1)(b)(I) (2009) only authorized health care facilities and individual providers to charge patients for the reasonable costs of providing the copies. The Board's 2001 and 2008 patient copy rules did not support the Board's summary judgment motion because they did not indicate that the copy fees reflected costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proponent attempted unsuccessfully to place an initiative on the city's municipal ballot. The proponent argued that the city's single subject ordinance was unconstitutional because it was adopted without first holding a public election to allow voters to decide the matter through a state constitutional amendment, and because it violated the right to petition. The appellate court ruled that Colorado Springs, Colo., City Code &sect; 5.1.503, the city's ordinance requiring a single subject to be expressed in ballot initiatives, did not offend the Colorado Constitution. The city, as a home rule city, was authorized to enact ordinances establishing the manner in which municipal legislation was exercised, which included ordinances that required initiatives submitted for voter approval to contain only single subjects. Also, the appellate court agreed with the trial court that the proposed initiative contained more than one subject with two distinct and separate purposes. Furthermore, the motion to disqualify the trial judge was insufficient to warrant recusal. The allegations of bias and prejudice were based largely on the trial judge's prior rulings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Jefferson County District Court (Colorado) found defendant guilty of aggravated incest under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-302 (2009) and sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-405.3 (2009). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before trial, the prosecution moved to admit separate hearsay statements that the victim, defendant's daughter, had made about the assault to her mother, a physician, and a social worker. After a hearing, the trial court found that the statements were admissible under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-25-129 (2009). They were presented to the jury, although the victim also testified at trial. Defendant contended that the trial court erred by admitting the child victim's hearsay statements under &sect; 13-25-129. Defendant asserted that the statute should be interpreted as applying only to victims who were less than 15 years of age at the time of any unlawful sexual offense under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-411(1) (2009). The victim was 16 years old when defendant allegedly assaulted her. Because the phrase &quot;when the victim was less than fifteen years of age at the time of the commission of the offense&quot; in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-25-129(1) applied only to a victim of incest under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-301 (2009), which defendant was not charged with, the appellate court concluded that the trial court did not err by admitting the victim's hearsay statements under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-25-129 (2009).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An administrative law judge (ALJ) with the Colorado Office of Administrative Courts entered an order determining that respondent organization was not an &quot;issue committee&quot; within the meaning of Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(10)(a), with respect to a right-to-work ballot initiative and that the organization had not violated Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-45-108(1)(a)(I) and (3) (2009) of the Fair Campaign Practices Act. Appellant complainant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the facts in the record demonstrated that the organization had a major purpose of supporting the initiative. The ALJ erred in her analysis in three ways: (1) she placed undue weight on the fact the organization had purposes other than supporting the initiative; (2) she gave too much weight to activities that the organization merely considered undertaking while giving too little weight to what it actually did; and (3) she failed to give weight to other facts relevant to the inquiry. Because the organization was created at the same time the ballot issue was conceived of, was operated and represented by individuals otherwise intimately involved in drafting and promoting the ballot issue individually and through other organizations, spent its entire first year promoting the ballot issue to the exclusion of almost all other activities, and spent three-fourths of all of the funds it had ever expended promoting that ballot issue, the conclusion was inescapable that the organization had a major purpose of supporting the ballot issue. The phrase &quot;a major purpose&quot; in Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(10)(a)(I), was not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings on whether the organization was an &quot;issue committee&quot; under Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(10)(a), and if necessary, for the imposition of appropriate penalties if the ALJ were to determine that the organization was an issue committee and failed to comply with the Act's registration and reporting requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit alleging claims of defamation and malicious prosecution, plaintiff, the wife of a decedent, appealed a judgment of the City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado) against defendant, the decedent's sister, arguing that the district court erred in reducing the jury's award of exemplary damages and in denying her motion to increase exemplary damages under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-102(1)(a) and (3) (2009).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the decedent's final illness, his wife and sister became embroiled in a bitter dispute. Following the decedent's death, his sister accused his police sergeant wife of murder, fraud, theft, and misuse of police authority. The wife filed suit alleging claims of malicious prosecution and defamation. The district court found in favor of the wife as a matter of law but submitted the issue of damages to the jury. In seeking additional punitive damages, the wife pointed the fact that her husband's sister continued her defamatory and malicious conduct during the pendency of the present litigation. On review of the judgment entered, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to increase the exemplary damages award because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-102(3) did not require the trial court to increase the exemplary damages beyond the statutory amount that could be properly awarded by the jury as compensatory damages. Further, the trial court did not err under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-102(1)(a) in reducing the jury's award of exemplary damages because it properly capped the exemplary damages award at the amount of the compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole a cell phone and a wallet while at a nightclub and made withdrawals from a victim's bank account using stolen debit cards. Bank surveillance video captured defendant making the unauthorized withdrawals, and the cell phone was found during a search of his car when he was arrested on an unrelated charge. On review, the court held that, under the U.S. Supreme Court's recent Gant ruling, the police violated defendant's Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, rights when they searched defendant's car incident to his arrest because defendant had already been secured and was beyond reaching distance of the car's passenger compartment when the search was conducted. However, although the court recognized that, under the retroactive application of Gant, the police violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, it declined to apply the remedy of suppressing the evidence because the statutory good faith exception under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-308 supported the denial of defendant's motion to suppress, as the court found it reasonable for the police to act according to Supreme Court precedent as it existed on the date they conducted the search.</SPAN></P>

XXVIII, &sect; 2(8). Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents were tax-exempt political organizations. During the 2008 election cycle, respondents paid for and distributed advertisements discussing certain candidates for the state legislature. Appellant alleged that respondents had engaged in advertising for the purpose of expressly advocating the election of certain candidates. Appellant contended that this rendered both organizations &quot;political committees&quot; pursuant to Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(12)(a) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-45-103(14) (2009). Appellant claimed that respondents were required to register as political committees with the secretary of state and comply with restrictions as to the amount of contributions that they could accept. The ALJ granted respondents' motion to dismiss, finding that the advertisements in question did not constitute &quot;express advocacy&quot; as the ALJ construed that phrase. The Court of Appeals of Colorado upheld the decision. Respondents' advertisements merely stated that local leaders endorsed a particular candidate. These advertisements did not meet the definition of express advocacy under Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(8), because they did not contain the &quot;magic words.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order of the City and County of Denver District Court, Colorado, denying his motion for postconviction relief under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) following the entry of guilty pleas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to three counts of theft over $ 15,000, each a class three felony in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-401(1), (2)(d). In postconviction proceedings, appellant's double jeopardy claim was not waived by his entry of a guilty plea. Section 18-4-401(4) designated all instances of theft within a six-month period as a single theft offense; because two of the theft counts occurred within a single six-month period, his conviction violated his right to be free from double jeopardy. The Court of Appeals of Colorado held that he was entitled to have two of the convictions merged. The felony complaints tracking the language of section 18-4-401(1) were sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the county court, which had power to bind felony cases over to the district courts. Appellant's admission that the substantive crimes of theft occurred in Denver was sufficient to prove a factual basis for the court's jurisdiction. By entering a guilty plea, appellant waived his equal protection challenge to the theft statute. The district court had the power to sentence appellant to the custody of the department of corrections.</SPAN></P>

The case was remanded for the district court to merge appellant's two convictions in 05CR5321 and to resentence him to two six-year terms, running consecutively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in Missouri on an armed robbery charge. The police believed that they could link him to another robbery, and defendant consented to give a DNA sample. After noting that defendant had a Colorado arrest record, the police contacted Denver police and forwarded defendant's DNA profile to them. Based upon that DNA profile, defendant was charged with kidnapping, rape, and robbery stemming from an attack upon a woman four years earlier. Defendant moved to suppress, but the trial court denied his motion. On review, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion because his consent was voluntary even though Missouri law enforcement officials did not expressly advise him that his DNA would be used for purposes other than determining whether his DNA matched DNA associated with the Missouri robbery charge; defendant consented to provide a DNA sample and failed to limit his consent in any way. Under the totality of the circumstances, defendant's consent was not rendered involuntary merely because the Missouri authorities did not expressly inform him that his DNA sample might be used to implicate him in other crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the trial court did not give special weight to her determination of the child's best interests. The appellate court found that when a non-parent sought allocation of parental responsibilities contrary to the wishes of a parent, the court may not allocate parental responsibilities to the non-parent unless it complied with the requirement to accord &quot;special weight&quot; to the parent's determination of the best interests of the chid. The court had to consider all relevant factors including those listed in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-124(1.5)(a) and (b) (2009). A parent's liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of his or her child was not infringed when the parent's determination regarding the best interests of the child was overcome by clear and convincing proof of relevant factors and the court's determination of the best interests of the child. The trial court's finding that the couple were psychological parents was not sufficient to accord special weight to the mother's parental rights. The record did not demonstrate that the court accorded any &quot;special weight&quot; to the mother's liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of the child.</SPAN></P>

Because that figure did not exceed defendant's $ 75,000 settlement offer, the trial court ordered plaintiff to pay defendant's costs of $ 25,721 pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13-17-202, 13-16-105 (2009). On appeal, plaintiff contended that the offer of settlement statute was unconstitutional. Plaintiff's brief did not comply with Colo.

Having thoroughly examined the 834-page record, the Court of Appeals of Colorado found no indication that plaintiff presented to the trial court any constitutional challenge to the validity of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-17-202. Therefore, the issue was not properly preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with distribution of marijuana and possession of eight ounces or more of marijuana. The trial court did not err in failing to suppress the evidence found in a search of the building adjacent to defendant's residence, because he lacked standing to challenge the search. The information tracked the statutory language and provided surrounding factual details sufficient to vest jurisdiction over the possession of marijuana offense. The trial judge was not required to recuse himself, because he had acted as a prosecuting attorney in a case against defendant seven years earlier. The trial judge had no knowledge of evidentiary facts concerning the current proceeding. The trial court committed constitutional error by giving the jury a predeliberation instruction several times during the three-day trial; the People did not point to any evidence to overcome the predeliberation presumption. The Court of Appeals of Colorado held that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Because defendant's challenge required the court to consult the facts underlying the plea, it did not fall within the exceptions to the general rule that guilty pleas barred the right to raise constitutional questions.

The appellate court ruled that the evidence at the revocation hearing was sufficient to support the hearing officer's conclusions that there was reasonable suspicion to justify the initial traffic stop and probable cause to justify defendant's arrest. Since the arresting officer did not testify, his assertions in the documentary evidence were hearsay, and there was no indication in the documentary evidence whether his assertions that the licensee was weaving were based on his own observations of the licensee's driving as the stopping officer or whether they were based instead on information from fellow police officers making the initial stop.

The appellate court disagreed with the prosecution's contention that there was no actual conflict of interest because the record showed that when trial counsel became aware of defendant's allegation, he was very upset and that both trial counsel and his partner recognized the significant impact of the allegation. Moreover, trial counsel's actual conflict of interest adversely affected his representation of defendant. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police received a tip that defendant's residence had &quot;come and go&quot; traffic. When a detective executed a search warrant, he noticed a strong scent of marijuana. The detective found 44 marijuana plants, cash in defendant's bedroom, and 67 medium-sized zip lock jeweler's bags. Defendant told the detective that she grew four different kinds of marijuana plants because she suffered from headaches. At issue on appeal was whether defendant qualified as a primary care-giver under Colo. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 14. The appellate court concluded that defendant was required to do more to manage the well-being of a patient who had a debilitating medical condition than merely supply marijuana. The act of supplying marijuana for medical use, by itself, was insufficient to constitute significant management responsibility for a patient's well-being, and consequently was insufficient to constitutionally qualify a person doing so as a primary care-giver. Also, the appellate court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-406(8)(b)(I) (2009) because the phrase &quot;intent to distribute&quot; was a term that a person of ordinary intelligence could understand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant petitioner's second degree kidnapping as a class two felony and 24-year sentence was affirmed on direct appeal. The petitioner sought postconviction relief, alleging that his conviction of a class two felony based on a crime of which he was acquitted violated his constitutional rights, and his counsel was ineffective for not raising the issue. The Weld County District Court, Colorado, denied the petitioner relief, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the petitioner contended the enhancement of his kidnapping conviction violated double jeopardy; the jury instruction for the kidnapping charge was constitutionally deficient; and his constitutional right to have a jury determine the facts used to aggravate his sentence was violated. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the plain language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-302(3)(a) (2009) specifically required only that the person kidnapped be a victim of sexual assault, not that the kidnapper have perpetrated that crime. Contrary to defendant's argument, he was not being punished for the crime of which he was acquitted; rather, he was being punished for the kidnapping, and such punishment was enhanced because the victim of the kidnapping suffered some additional harm during the kidnapping. As the instruction tracked the language of the statute, the jury was properly instructed. Because the rule announced in Blakely and Apprendi only applied when an offender received a sentence outside the presumptive range, and defendant's 24-year sentence was within the presumptive range for the class two felony of which the jury convicted him, Blakely and Apprendi were not implicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed, but the case was remanded to the trial court to remove a reference from the mittimus.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also did not abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecution to refer to defendant by his nickname, as the nickname was relevant to the issue of identification. The trial court also did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony that defendant possessed a gun or in allowing a witness to testify that defendant threatened to kill his codefendant if the codefendant talked to the police about the murder.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court focused its analysis on the constitutionality of the city's special review procedure, under a strict scrutiny standard of review. The appellate court concluded the special review procedure did not provide adequate procedural safeguards. The murals were signs as that term was defined by the sign code, Englewood, Colo., Municipal Code &sect; 16-11-2, and thus constituted speech protected under U.S. Const. amend. I. The appellate court noted that no part of the sign code or the special review policy provided a specific period within which the city manager or designee was required to determine whether to approve a permit after receiving the sign committee's recommendation. The essential procedural safeguard was a constitutionally impermissible prior restraint on protected free speech. Attorney's fees were not available under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 because the shop owner did not bring a cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

It was not necessary for the prosecution to prove anyone in particular intended the pistol be capable of discharging bullets or the like. Under Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence was introduced that defendant had sexually assaulted his 12-year-old stepdaughter over a seven month period while she was living with him. The victim also testified that defendant had sexually assaulted her while they were living elsewhere. The appellate court concluded that the earlier incident was properly admitted because the incident occurred within 10 years prior to the predicate offenses charged under Colo. Rev.

Defendant argued that he lacked notice of another incident that allegedly took place in an apartment; however, the appellate court did not discern a clear abuse of discretion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim told her great-grandmother and others that defendant had touched her vaginal and anal areas.

Stat. &sect; 16-10-301 and Colo. R. Evid. 404(b). The appellate court rejected the contention that the witness's allegations were not logically relevant to the issue of the intent. The evidence of the prior acts satisfied a Spoto analysis. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence of defendant's prior sexual assaults on the witness. The trial court also did not err in excluding evidence under Colorado's rape shield statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-407 (2009). The appellate court found defendant's due process right of confrontation arguments were unavailing. Further, the rape shield statute also did not deny the equal protection of the law because &sect; 18-3-407 was a rational attempt by the legislature to protect a complainant. As to the sentence, the appellate court agreed with defendant's contention that the 15-year lower limit of his indeterminate sentence exceeded the maximum authorized by law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation initiated condemnation proceedings. At the immediate possession hearing, the Weld County District Court, Colorado, found that the corporation proved by a preponderance of the evidence that it was entitled to immediate possession. Respondent landowners appealed the trial court's order granting immediate possession of the landowners' properties and its judgment determining the properties' values.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation requested landowners to amend an easement over their properties to allow the corporation to install within the easement a pipeline adjacent to a previously installed pipeline. After negotiations, the corporation and landowners failed to reach an agreement. The landowners contended that the trial court erred by finding that the corporation had legal authority to condemn the properties because the corporation did not qualify as an entity granted the power of eminent domain under either Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-4-102 (2009) or Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-5-105 (2009). The corporation was a foreign corporation that operated and maintained the pipeline on landowners' properties; it conveyed petroleum products through its pipelines; and it would be responsible for the construction, cost, operation, and maintenance of the pipeline. The corporation was a pipeline company for the purposes of &sect; 38-5-105. The appellate court did not construe Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 7-43-102 to define a pipeline company. Further, the trial court properly found that the pipeline would serve a public purpose. Finally, the landowners' properties were not unconstitutionally taken without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that, because appellee employer did not initiate the division-sponsored independent medical examination (DIME) process to challenge the authorized treating physician's (ATP) findings as to maximum medical improvement (MMI) and permanent impairment, the ATP's opinion that the employee sustained a work injury was binding and the administrative law judge (ALJ) was divested of jurisdiction to consider the issues of causation and compensability. The appellate court found that the employer did not challenge either the MMI determination or the impairment rating. Contrary to the employee's position, the applicable statutory scheme granted no authority to the ATP to determine causation as it pertained to compensability. Because compensability remained a factual question for determination by the ALJ without application of an enhanced burden of proof, the employee's inability to procure a DIME posed no disadvantage to her. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-107.2(2)(b) (2008) was not vague and the employee did not show a due process violation. Any errors in the ALJ's evidentiary rulings were harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the El Paso County District Court (Colorado) that convicted him of first-degree murder after deliberation and felony murder under Colo.

The victim refused to allow defendant to speak with the friend, and a fight ensued. As defendant departed, he threatened to return and made a threat to the friend that she interpreted to mean that defendant planned to destroy belongings that she stored in a storage unit rented to defendant's wife. Defendant returned with an accomplice the following day, broke into the victim's home, and attacked the pair, killing the victim. At trial and over defendant's objection, the trial court permitted the State to introduce evidence that defendant had broken into his wife's storage unit and destroyed the victim's property. On review, the court held that the evidence was properly admitted under Colo. R. Evid. 403 and 404 because the evidence showed defendant's motive and plan to carry out the threats made after fighting with the victim on the previous day. Further, the reasonable doubt jury instruction was not improper for containing the word &quot;should,&quot; as the instruction clearly informed the jury of its obligation to acquit defendant if the prosecution did not prove every element of each offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The El Paso County District Court, Colorado, granted judgment in favor of appellee parents, who obtained a multi-million dollar negligence verdict against appellants, doctor and medical group, for post-natal injuries to their minor daughter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the parents could rely on the amended statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-64-205(1)(f) (2008). The amended statute was intended to apply as it directed that the new provisions applied to civil actions pending on or after the effective date of August 3, 2007. The amended statute was remedial in that it extended to incapacitated plaintiffs the ability to obtain a form of damages. They did not eliminate any substantive right formerly vested in appellants. Appellants' special argument did not raise a reasonableness challenge nor would any such challenge have merit. The amended statute was not unconstitutional special legislation,&nbsp;Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 25, because, by covering all minor and incapacitated persons who received large medical malpractice verdicts, it had general future applicability. The trial court's consideration of lack of prior earnings as one factor in evaluating good cause/unfairness did not deny equal protection to the child. The trial court properly allowed appellee insurer to recover its prior payments on behalf of the parents from appellants. The insurer's subrogation rights were not limited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was undisputed that the victim (a female student who attended the same school as the juvenile) became extremely intoxicated while at a party with the juvenile. The trial court found that the juvenile accompanied the victim to a private room where he had sexual intercourse with her even though he knew that she was too intoxicated to appraise the nature of her conduct, or to consent. In addition, the court relied on the testimony of a nurse who examined the victim soon after the assault and observed vaginal tearing and bruising consistent with recent intercourse. Based on these and other findings, the court concluded that the prosecution had proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the juvenile violated Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-402(1)(b), (1)(h). Next, the trial court did not conduct a sentencing hearing until eighty-eight days after the expiration of the forty-five-day mandatory deadline. The appellate court concluded that, because the juvenile had a statutory right to be sentenced within forty-five days of adjudication pursuant to Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant met the murder charge against him by claiming that he acted to protect himself and his companions. At trial, the district court rejected defendant's proposed instructions and gave an instruction that tracked the language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-704(4) (2008). The jury convicted defendant of first-degree extreme indifference murder. On review, the court concluded that the trial court committed reversible error in instructing the jury that the prosecution did not have the burden of disproving self-defense or the defense of others. The element of malice was negated by conduct that constituted self-defense or the defense of others under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-704 if defendant reasonably believed that he or another was about to suffer unlawful physical force and responded with the appropriate force; if defendant was acting in self-defense or defense of another, then he was not acting under circumstances that evidenced an attitude of universal malice manifesting extreme indifferent to human life.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that downloading and saving sexually exploitative material in a share-capable computer file did not constitute the felony offense of sexual exploitation of a child as defined in Colo.

The trial court erred in allowing the case to go to the jury on the theory that defendant &quot;arranged for&quot; the pornographic images to be distributed and erroneously construed the term &quot;arranged for&quot; as encompassing either arranging for the distribution of material or arranging to obtain material; because the Colorado General Assembly did not proscribe arranging for obtaining or distributing pornographic material in the plain language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-403(3)(b), such conduct was not proscribed by the prohibition against arranging for sexually exploitative material. Because the State failed to establish that defendant published, promoted, sold, financed, offered, exhibited, advertised, dealt in, or distributed child pornography, the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for the sexual exploitation of a child.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that he was under the influence of prescription medications when the offenses occurred. The trial court did not err by denying his requested instruction for mistake of fact as an affirmative defense; defendant in essence sought to add an element, &quot;knowingly&quot;, which was already contained within the offense. The Court of Appeals of Colorado held that the trial court did not violate defendant's right to testify or privilege against self-incrimination under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25 by requiring him to testify on the first day of trial. Defendant made his decision to testify before there was any discussion about the timing of his testimony, so the court's decision concerning the timing of his testimony could not have influenced his decision. Defendant failed to prove that the trial judge was not impartial simply because he barred defendant's expert from answering a question asked by defense counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Douglas County District Court (Colorado), which convicted him of first-degree burglary in violation of Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for first-degree burglary, third-degree assault, menacing, second-degree criminal tampering, and first-degree criminal trespass, but the appellate court affirmed. The Miranda warnings delivered to defendant at the start of his second station-house interview were effective in accomplishing their object. The second interview was not a continuation of the first and defendant's choice not to assert his right to remain silent was not a product of ineffective Miranda warnings. Additionally, the jury instructions did not imply that the prosecution had been relieved of any burden to prove defendant's mental state. There was no double jeopardy violation under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-408(1)(a) (2008). Neither criminal tampering nor menacing was a lesser-included offense and neither therefore merged with the burglary conviction. Element number five did not require the prosecution to prove all of the elements of either criminal tampering or menacing in order to prove that defendant committed burglary. Rather, the prosecution needed only to prove that defendant intended to commit tampering or menacing when he entered the victim's home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an inmate in the custody of appellee, the Colorado Department of Corrections (DOC), appealed an order of the El Paso County District Court (Colorado) that dismissed his complaint challenging the DOC's classification of him as a sex offender under former Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-22-103(2)(d), arguing that the DOC abused its discretion when it classified him as a sex offender because he had not been convicted of a sex offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A DOC hearing panel classified the inmate as a sex offender, basing its determination on the inmate's alleged sexual assault of his ex-girlfriend. The inmate filed a complaint under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4) seeking judicial review of the DOC's classification. On review of the district court's order of dismissal, the court held that the DOC properly classified the inmate as a sex offender because there was evidence in the record establishing that he sexually assaulted his ex-girlfriend. The victim's statements and police reports enabled the hearing panel to conclude that the inmate behaved in a sexually violent and abusive manner by subjecting an adult female victim to unwanted sexual contact through threats, intimidation, and physical force; therefore, the competent evidence in the record supported the classification of the inmate as a sex offender. The fact that the prosecution did not believe that it could prove a sexual assault charge beyond a reasonable doubt did not preclude the hearing panel from determining that the same evidence established, by a preponderance of the evidence, each of the prerequisites for classification as a sex offender within the DOC.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a personal injury action involving a joint use utility pole, defendant telephone company appealed the judgment of the City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado) that entered judgment on a jury verdict in favor of plaintiffs, a lineman and his wife, and third-party defendant electric company, and denied the telephone company's post-trial motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The telephone company argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by increasing the exemplary damages award without granting it a hearing. The court of appeals agreed. Without a hearing concerning conduct during the pendency of the case, the trial court could not have determined whether &quot;willful and wanton manner&quot; under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-102 had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The telephone company did not have an opportunity to develop a complete record during trial on the reasons for its failure to implement a periodic pole inspection program. The lack of a hearing severely limited review of the order increasing exemplary damages. It was not known what additional evidence might have been offered concerning factors relevant to the due process implications of the ratio of any increased exemplary damages to compensatory damages, which were high. The telephone company had a substantial interest in any increase to exemplary damages because a post-trial hearing was its only opportunity to further develop a record for de novo review of an increased award. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in not granting the telephone company a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order increasing exemplary damages was vacated and the case was remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the lineman's motion to increase exemplary damages.

Appellee Civil Service Commission, reversing an administrative hearing officer, upheld the suspension. The officer sought judicial review, and City and County of Denver District Court, Colorado, affirmed the Commission. The officer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the officer contended the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction or abused its discretion in upholding his suspension and argued that the &quot;highest standard of efficiency and safety&quot; provision in the police department's operations manual was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court disagreed, finding that a provision requiring officers to use the &quot;highest standard of efficiency and safety&quot; survived a vagueness challenge as this standard could have been applied to evaluate the reasonableness of officers' actions in light of their training; the standard was an objective one providing fair notice, and judicial review was available to ensure it was applied fairly. Contrary to the officer's contention, review was authorized under Denver, Colo., Municipal Code &sect; 9.4.15(F) as the hearing officer's decision reasonably could have been determined to have rested on an erroneous interpretation of departmental or civil service rules and policy considerations that may have had effect beyond the case at hand. The department was not legally precluded from using its operations manual to review the propriety of its officers' tactical decisions preceding an actual use of force.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant sustained an admitted injury to her bilateral upper extremities and suffered from bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. A physician opined that her impairment did not extend beyond her extremities and rated the right arm at seven percent impairment and the left arm at four percent impairment. The ALJ concluded that claimant had failed to meet her burden of proving that she was permanently and totally disabled. The Court of Appeals of Colorado upheld the decision based on claimant's refusal to undergo surgery, and her failure to prove she had no ability to earn wages. The ALJ acted within his discretion in sustaining respondent employer's objection to irrelevant testimony. Given the exclusivity of the remedy under Colorado's Workers' Compensation Act, claimant had no right to proceed against her employer in the district court; an express waiver or surrender of any common law rights was not necessary. Claimant was not entitled to a remand, because the Court of Appeals failed to act within thirty days. The 30-day time limit set forth in Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Jefferson County District Court (Colorado) convicting him of one count of securities fraud in the course of business, in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-51-501(1)(c) (2008), and one count of computer crime, in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5.5-102(1). The People cross-appealed certain aspects of a restitution order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant worked as a salesperson, seeking investors for children's television programming. He sold units, which the jury found to be securities. There was evidence that defendant knew that cease and desist orders prohibited the sale of units in various other states and that defendant was culpable for misrepresentations in the brochure. The trial court denied defendant's motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that defendant committed securities fraud in the course of business, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-51-501(1)(c) (2008). However, the court found insufficient evidence to convict defendant of computer crime, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5.5-102(1), because defendant's use of a computer was sparse and his interaction with computers at his employer's place of business was remote and attenuated at best. The jury was properly instructed on the concept of reasonable doubt. The district court did not err in ordering defendant to pay restitution to specified victims, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-205 (2008), and by ruling that co-defendants were not jointly and severally liable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for securities fraud, reversed his conviction for computer fraud, vacated defendant's sentence for computer fraud, and otherwise affirmed. The restitution order was affirmed, as modified to not require the Attorney General to distribute the restitution monies among the victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was injured in an admitted, work-related accident. The employer and its insurer paid temporary total disability (TTD) benefits and, later, benefits for permanent partial disability (PPD). The employer also admitted liability for permanent total disability (PTD) benefits. The employer discovered that it had overpaid the claimant. The claimant asserted that recovery of an overpayment arising from an employer's error was barred by caselaw. Nevertheless, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-303(1) &amp; (2)(a) permitted reopening of an award because of overpayment. Further, the meaning of the statutory definition of &quot;overpayment&quot; in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-40-201(15.5) was clear and unambiguous. The claimant argued that the ALJ failed to account for the employer's deduction of the lump sum award from the total overpayment calculated; however, the ALJ had discretion to fashion a remedy. The ALJ's calculations made clear that the amount of overpayment was determined by adding the excess benefits actually paid to claimant. The claimant was entitled to have his benefits for PTD capped at 91 percent of the state average weekly wage that was in effect at the time of his disablement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was set aside as to the amount of PTD benefits claimant was entitled to receive, and the case was remanded to the ALJ for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district and the charter school entered into a charter school contract that contemplated funding for a long-term facility based on sharing proceeds of future mill levies or bond issues. To obtain specific long-term facility funding, the charter school initiated non-binding third-party arbitration under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-30.5-107.5 (2008). An arbitrator agreed with the charter school that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-30.5-105(2)(c)(II) (2008) required a charter school contract to include funding, and ordered the school district to provide funding. The appellate court concluded that the charter school was subject to the political subdivision doctrine; therefore, the charter school lacked standing. Moreover, &sect; 22-30.5-107.5 precluded judicial review of the decision because the charter school's dissatisfaction with the contract arose out of implementation of the statutorily required portions and was reserved for resolution by the State Board. Further, the parents rights were not violated under the Colorado Constitution because the parents did not cite to any case interpreting the phrase &quot;thorough and uniform&quot; to require that a school district equitably allocate expenditures.</SPAN></P>

The employer failed to respond and the director issued an order finding it in default and imposing a fine. On appeal, the employer appears to argue that service of the notice to show compliance by mail was insufficient. Nevertheless, the record indicated and the employer did not contest that it received actual notice. The service was not constitutionally deficient. The employer next contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-409 violated due process because it did not mandate that an evidentiary hearing occur prior to the issuance of a default order. The appellate court concluded that it was reasonable to condition the occurrence of an administrative hearing on an employer's timely request to participate in a prehearing conference.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State brought a forfeiture proceeding before the Adams County District Court, Colorado. Appellant surety appealed the district court's judgment forfeiting a $ 20,000 bond posted for a defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surety posted an appearance bond promising to pay $20,000 to the State if defendant, who was charged with felonies, failed to appear. When defendant failed to appear, the district court ordered the bond forfeited. The surety moved to limit bond liability to the amount of fees collected from defendant. Defendant was a Mexican national who had been in this country illegally, and who had been deported to Mexico prior to the arraignment at which he failed to appear. The surety argued the bond forfeiture judgment violated Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-503(1)(c). The legislative history of this statute confirmed the appellate court's reading of subsection (1)(c) as intended to limit professional bonding agents' liability to the actual fees collected. The appellate court also concluded that the new provisions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-503 did not apply to this case. Applying subsection (1)(c) would change the consequences for two contracting parties -- the surety and the State -- after defendant had failed to appear for a required court proceeding. In sum, the surety was not entitled to relief because &sect; 16-3-503(1)(c) did not apply retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six days after the effective date of the repeal of the Colorado Auto Accident Reparations Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 10-4-701 to -725, the parties were involved in a collision. The injured party was a named insured on a policy that had been renewed prior to the repeal of the Act. The policy provided a basic level of personal injury protection (PIP) benefits that included wage-loss reimbursements and payment of medical expenses. In a subsequent negligent trial, no damages were awarded. This appeal followed. In partially reversing, the appellate court held that the district court did not err by prohibiting the injured party from presenting evidence of past medical expenses or in denying her request for a continuance to seek additional medical treatment and recovery of damages therefor. However, the district court erred by applying the repealed Act and instructing the jury to subtract from the injured party's lost earnings wage reimbursements that she received from her own PIP insurance. The repeal of former Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10-4-713(1) was presumed to be prospective in nature, and the driver had no vested right to assert &sect; 10-4-713(1). Finally, a collateral source exception applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the judgment relating to lost earnings was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial on that claim. The rest of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a school district, its board, and two individuals, sued defendant State, challenging the constitutionality of Part 5 of the Colorado Charter Schools Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22-30.5-501 to 22-30.5-516 (2008). The District Court of the City and County of Denver, Colorado, granted the State's motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found Part 5 to be constitutional. Although plaintiffs argued that Part 5 is unconstitutional because Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, and 15, collectively prohibit the legislature from establishing schools that are not part of the local school district system, the court disagreed with this argument. The general arrangements of Part 5 maintain a balance between the competing interests of local school districts and the State. Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, does not prohibit the State from establishing institute charter schools that are not controlled by school districts. The creation of institute charter schools, which are funded exclusively from state-controlled funds, does not exceed the State Board of Education's general supervisory powers under Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2, or infringe on a school district's right of local control under Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 15. Regarding plaintiffs' claim that Part 5 violates the right to local self-government under Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 35, the court disagreed with plaintiffs' argument that the functioning of the public schools primarily affects only those within the geographic boundaries of a school district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During hunting season, the licensees drove across private property adjacent to public lands open for hunting, while in possession of hunting firearms and licenses, and dressed in hunter safety orange. The licensees were charged with hunting on private property without permission in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-6-116 (2008). Ultimately, each licensee pled guilty to a reduced charge of criminal trespass and the original charges were dismissed. The licensees argued that since their license suspensions were based on the same facts as the criminal charges against them, the suspensions were barred by Double Jeopardy. The appellate court ruled that the license suspensions did not constitute multiple punishments in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The primary goal for the civil sanction was not the imposition of punishment, but the remedial purpose of protecting the public's interest in the State's wildlife. Also, a person of ordinary intelligence would know that if his criminal conviction had a close and logical connection to his hunting or fishing activity, such conduct fell within the ambit of potential license suspension under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-6-106.</SPAN></P>

The People granted defendant use-and-derivative-use immunity to compel his testimony at a codefendant's trial. By granting defendant use immunity before his own prosecution, the People bore the burden of proving that the trial evidence derived from sources wholly independent of the immunized testimony. In this case, the trial court's ruling was made without a transcript of defendant's immunized testimony. Without knowing the particulars of the immunized testimony, the Court of Appeals of Colorado held that the trial court could not have made the required finding that the People's evidence derived entirely from sources other than the immunized testimony. Because defendant consented to a trial outside the normal six-month time limits, his speedy trial claim failed. Where the prosecution conceded two discovery violations, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing two counts instead of granting a mistrial as a sanction. The prosecutor's rebuttal closing argument attacking the credibility of defendant's post-arrest denials was not plain error.</SPAN></P>

The Douglas County District Court, Colorado, held that the home builder was the worker's statutory employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker was a sole proprietor and an independent contractor who did trim work on a home under a contract between the worker and a subcontractor, which had agreed to do the work for the home builder. The worker alleged that the scaffolding had been negligently constructed, causing it to fall. At issue was whether damages were capped at $ 15,000 by operation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-41-401(3). On appeal, the worker challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The appellate court did not agree that the statute was special interest legislation. Further, the statute did not violate the equal protection guarantee because the classification was reasonable and rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. The appellate court also rejected the worker's argument that amount of the statutory cap was unreasonably low, arbitrary, and not rationally related to the purpose of encouraging participation in the worker's compensation system. The appellate court concluded that the trial court properly determined under the undisputed evidence in the record that the home builder was the worker's statutory employer within the meaning of Colo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a bounty hunter, was convicted for entering the victims' home in an attempt to locate a man who was out on bond but had failed to appear in court. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's burglary conviction. The evidence showed that defendant unlawfully entered the victims' home because, even though the common law bonding agent's privilege permitted a bond recovery agent to enter a principal's house to seize the principal, it was not necessary for defendant to enter because whether the man lived at the home was a disputed question, as defendant did not see the man at the home during the one hour of surveillance and he did not make any other efforts to locate him. A reasonable juror could conclude that defendant knew that his entry was unnecessary to seize the man because he did so after little investigation, when the man was not there, and using a ruse. There was also sufficient evidence that defendant committed the crime of menacing while in the home because two victims testified that they believed defendant pointed a gun at one victim after entering the home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For tax year 2001, the group filed a combined return. In 2002, three weeks after the deadline, the group filed an amended return, seeking to change its combined return to a combined-consolidated corporate income tax return. In 2005, after undergoing a tax audit, the group received a letter from the DOR denying its claim for an $ 8 million refund and rejecting its amended return. The issue presented was what the group knew and when did it know it, regarding the existence of a combined-consolidated income tax return filing option for certain Colorado corporations. The DOR argued that the trial court erred in reversing the director's decision to reject the group's amended 2001 return because the then existing statutory and regulatory scheme permitted the filing of combined-consolidated corporate income tax returns under the Colorado C Corporation Income Tax Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 39-22-300.1 to 39-22-310 (2008). The appellate court ruled that the published statutes and regulations in effect for tax year 2001 clearly allowed combined and consolidated returns together.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a proponent of a proposed ballot initiative, appealed from an order of the El Paso County District Court (Colorado) that denied his request for relief against defendants, a city, its initiative title-setting board, and the members thereof in their official capacities. The proponent argued that the city misapplied state law in restricting the ballot initiative to a single subject.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The title board concluded it was unable to determine, or convey in a title, the true meaning and intent of the proponent's petition, because the initiative contained multiple subjects in violation of the single subject requirement set forth in Colorado Springs CO. Code &sect; 5.1.503. The proponent wanted the court to set the ballot title to contain the entire text of the initiative verbatim. In reviewing the Colo. R. Civ. P. 57 declaratory judgment claim as a matter of law, the court of appeals concluded that the case must be remanded to the trial court for a determination on the constitutionality of the city's single subject ordinance. The city's single subject ordinance was substantially similar to the constitutional and statutory single subject rule. The ordinance, and not State constitutional provisions, applied to the initiative, and the proponent had not waived his challenge. Therefore, any determination whether the title board abused its discretion in finding that the proposed initiative violates the single subject requirement was premature, and the court declined to address that issue. Accordingly, the case was remanded for resolution of the constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded for a determination whether the city's ordinance was constitutional.

XXVIII, &sect; 2(10)(a), was neither facially vague nor overbroad. Art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(10)(a), did not sweep a substantial amount of protected speech within its application. The organization did not prove that the definition of &quot;issue committee&quot; was invalid in all respects and could not be constitutionally applied in any circumstances. The court rejected the organization's argument that the definition of &quot;a major purpose&quot; in art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(10)(a), was facially overbroad. Art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(10)(a), did not burden a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech. The court also concluded that the FCPA's disclosure requirements did not violate the right to engage in anonymous speech and association and that requiring the disclosure of the identity of contributors to ballot measures was constitutional.

As part of its operations, the company bought other tobacco products (OTP) directly from a tobacco manufacturer. The manufacturer, made, marketed and sold smokeless tobacco products to unaffiliated distributors. The company sought refunds for what it asserted were excess OTP excise taxes. The company had filed a prior action in which it alleged that the statute violated the Commerce Clause and sought a refund for tax years 1990 through 2001. In the current action, the company sought a refund for tax years 2002 through 2004 alleging violations of due process and equal protection. The appellate court found that the trial court conflated the requirements of issue preclusion with those of claim preclusion. The present suit involved only OTP excise taxes paid during various periods between 2002 and 2004. Although the current case and the prior action concerned the discriminatory nature of the OTP tax statutes in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, the equal protection claim in the current case and the equal protection claim adjudicated in the prior action were distinct.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed, stating that it rejected the mother's contention that the trial court violated her fundamental rights to parent her children by imposing on her the statutory burdens of establishing grounds to terminate the guardianships at issue and to modify the existing allocation of parental responsibilities. Moreover, the record clearly demonstrated that the district court appropriately applied the statutory standards contained in Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the plea agreement, the People agreed not to object to a direct sentence to community corrections, and the parties agreed to a six-year cap on any prison sentence imposed. Defendant argued that the nine-year prison sentence violated her right to due process because it was inconsistent with her understanding of the agreement. Because it was undisputed and defendant admitted that she was on probation for another felony at the time of the offense and the trial court held a hearing under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-301(1)(h) (2008), the nine-year DOC sentence was appropriate and within the range of sentences that could originally have been imposed for defendant's aggravated felony theft offense under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(A), (6), (8)(a)(III), and 18-4-401(2)(c) (2008). Furthermore, because defendant's agreement contained no explicit language covering the contingency of her termination from community corrections and, following her termination, a different factual predicate existed upon which the trial court could base its sentencing determination, the trial court was no longer bound by the terms of the agreement, including the six-year sentencing cap.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony theft and second-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft. The trial court determined that he was a habitual offender with two prior felony convictions in the 10 years leading up to the current crimes. The trial court sentenced him to 18 years in prison for his theft conviction, a class four felony, and four and one-half years in prison for the motor vehicle theft conviction, a class six felony. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not have the authority to sentence defendant as a habitual offender for the class six felony of aggravated motor vehicle theft. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(A) (2008) provided that the maximum sentence for a class six felony was 18 months. Because second-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft was a class six felony, it did not fall within the purview of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-801(1.5). However, even assuming that the offense of felony theft and the two predicate offenses were not individually grave or serious, in combination, they were sufficiently grave and serious to support a conclusion that defendant's 18-year sentence was not extreme and grossly disproportionate to his crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed. The habitual criminal sentence for the felony theft conviction was affirmed. The habitual criminal sentence for the aggravated motor vehicle theft conviction was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for resentencing on that conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Believing that the condominium association was overcharging condominium owners for services, the condominium owner requested records documenting housekeeping services and subsequently filed suit to compel production. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the association, holding that, because the association did not produce or maintain the records at issue and because they were created and maintained by the management company that provided services, the owner was entitled to no relief. On review, the court held that, because the management company was the association's agent, the records were subject to production if they constituted a part of the association's &quot;financial and other records&quot; under former Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-33.3-317. Summary judgment was improper because the record was insufficient to permit a determination of whether the records at issue contained information pertinent to the association's exercise of its responsibilities under the statute. While the trial court afforded greater weight to the evidence produced by the association in making its conclusion, weighing evidence was improper when passing upon a summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised many issues. The court reversed the first degree aggravated motor vehicle theft conviction and remanded with directions, but otherwise affirmed. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence. While the knowingly mens rea in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-409(2) (2008) did not necessarily apply to each of the eight aggravators, it did not follow that there was no mens rea requirement associated with the aggravator at issue in this case, &sect; 18-4-409(2)(h). Attaching or displaying unauthorized license plates was not unlawful unless it was done knowingly, for purposes of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-3-121(1)(b) (2008). The trial court's response in telling the jury that defendant did not have to know the plates did not belong to the truck was incorrect, and its subsequent reminder that all the elements of the relevant jury instruction had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt was inadequate. The evidence was sufficient to establish defendant's liability for second degree aggravated motor vehicle theft. Whether to retry defendant on the original charge or ask for resentencing on the lesser charge was left to the discretion of the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendant's constitutional right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment and Colo. Const. art.

The parties stipulated to a four-year prison sentence on one count consecutive to four to ten years imprisonment on the other count. A county court judge, sitting by assignment, sentenced defendant to 14 years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 48-year-old man, had five prior felony convictions for attempted sexual assault of a child, pandering, attempted theft, attempted first degree criminal trespass, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Because defendant was on parole for another felony, the presumptive term of imprisonment increased to four to twelve years per count under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(8)(a)(II) (2007). On appeal, he challenged the authority of the county court judge to impose the sentence and the proportionality of his sentence under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The chief judge of the Boulder district court had assigned the county court judge to sit as a district judge for one week. The court held that the Chief Justice's authority to assign judges under Colo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 5(3) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-6-218 (2007) could be delegated to the district judge. Further, defendant's sentences gave rise to no inference of gross disproportionality. Defendant tried to minimize his offense as simply providing beer and cigarettes to a 17-year-old boy; however, the trial court found that he was trying to lure the minor into a sexual encounter, a grave and serious offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Archuleta County District Court (Colorado), which denied his Colo.

P. 35(c) motion for postconviction relief following the revocation of his probation and which sentenced him to an indeterminate term of six years to life pursuant to the Colorado Sex Offender Lifetime Supervision Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-1.3-1001 to -1012 (2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's probation was revoked based on his failure to complete treatment and his possession of a knife. Although the district court agreed that the evidence as to the knife was insufficient to support the revocation, it rejected his remaining arguments in his motion. The court held that the condition of defendant's probation requiring him to attend and actively participate in sex offender evaluation and treatment program approved by his probation officer and to complete the treatment program and treatment contract to the satisfaction of his probation officer was not unconstitutionally vague either on its face or as applied to defendant. Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant's probation officer and treatment provider followed the requirements of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-1010 (2007) and in revoking defendant's probation. Finally, because there was ample support for the findings regarding defendant's violations independent of the alleged deficient performance of defense counsel, there was no error in the trial court's finding that defendant failed to establish the requisite prejudice to support his ineffective assistance claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the City and County of Denver, Colorado, entered a final judgment in favor of plaintiffs, a church and two of its parishioners, against one of two defendants on plaintiffs' private nuisance claim and against both defendants on plaintiffs' conspiracy to commit private nuisance claims. The trial court also issued a permanent injunction against both defendants. Defendants appealed the judgments and the injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants had led anti-abortion demonstrations at the church. The instant court concluded that there was evidence in the record to support the trial court's findings and conclusions that one of the defendants created a private nuisance and that both defendants engaged in a civil conspiracy to create a private nuisance. The injunction was content-neutral. Entering the church's property and obstructing access to the church were not inherently expressive acts; therefore, the injunction's prohibitions of such conduct were not restrictions on speech. The time limitations on defendants' speech burdened no more speech than necessary to serve the interests protected by the injunction. The time restrictions applied only during worship and preparation for worship at the church. However, it could not be determined from the record whether the place and manner restrictions burdened more speech than was necessary. The place restrictions were not defined by a perimeter drawn a given distance from the protected facility, but were defined by a map attached to the injunction order. The trial court did not make specific findings justifying the scope and extent of the manner restrictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments were affirmed. The injunction order was vacated as to the restriction on defendants' entry onto the church's property. The case was remanded for specific findings and, if necessary, amendment of the injunction as to the place and manner restrictions on picketing and noise in each buffer zone. The injunction was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former husband sought review of post-decree orders of the Arapahoe County District Court (Colorado) finding that the husband had not fully disclosed the value of a retirement pension, awarding the entire marital portion of the pension to appellee former wife, and ordering the husband to pay one-half of the master's fees to investigate the wife's allegations of non-disclosure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a marriage dissolution, permanent orders were entered after a hearing before a retired judge, who was selected by the parties pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-3-111 (2007). The parties agreed to share the husband's pensions equally. The wife filed a motion to adopt a qualified domestic relations order. In a non-jury action, the trial court appointed a special master to investigate the facts. The husband's appeal of the trial court's order to appoint the master and the trial court's order requiring each party to pay one-half of the master's fees to investigate the wife's allegations were premature. The orders were not final for purposes of appeal because the rights of the parties were not completely determined. The husband had failed to object to the initial appointment of the master, and therefore he did not preserve the issue for appeal. Finding that the special master's factual findings were not clearly erroneous, the court accepted the master's findings of non-disclosure and that the husband's omission of the value of his portion of the pension materially affected the division of assets, pursuant to Colo. R. Civ. P. 53(e)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the part of the trial court's judgment adopting the special master's factual findings and in determining that the husband's omission of the value of his marital portion of his pension materially affected the division of assets. The court dismissed the part of the husband's appeal relating to the orders continuing the appointment of the master requiring the parties initially to share the payment of his fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered a decree of legal separation in March 2005 that incorporated the parties' separation agreement. The separation agreement provided that the husband retained his separate property including the entire interest in a limited liability company that owned certain stock. In January 2007, the wife filed a motion to set aside the separation agreement on the ground that the husband had failed to make a full disclosure of his assets in violation of former Colo. R. Civ. P. 26.2(a)(1)(A), (e), (g)(1), which was repealed and replaced by Colo. R. Civ. P. 16.2. The stock owned by the limited liability company substantially increased in value during the marriage. The court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to rule on the wife's motion. Colo. R. Civ. P. 16.2(e)(10) applied to post-decree motions filed on or after January 1, 2005, that sought to reopen a property division or to set aside a separation agreement based on alleged misstatements, omissions, or nondisclosure of assets or liabilities that materially affected the division of property. The rule change was not unconstitutionally retrospective simply because it expanded the remedy afforded to the wife.</SPAN></P>

The People argued that the appellate court was without jurisdiction because a deferred judgment and sentence agreement was not subject to direct appellate review unless and until such time as it was revoked. The appellate court agreed with the People. Colo. R. Crim. P. 35 established postconviction remedies, and no conviction entered when a deferred judgment and sentence agreement remained unrevoked. It was undisputed that appellant's stipulation to the deferred judgment and sentence agreement was the event that triggered the applicability of the statutory mandate. Because appellant stipulated to genetic marker testing, the appellate court was without jurisdiction to review an order which did nothing more than hold appellant to the stipulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected defendant's arguments that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in trash placed curbside for collection, that the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony under Colo.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-401, was unconstitutional. However, the court agreed that defendant's conviction for manufacturing methamphetamine should merge into his conviction for manufacturing that substance in the presence of a child. A comparison of the two statutes showed that child abuse based on manufacturing a controlled substance included all of the elements of manufacturing a controlled substance. Because proof of child abuse based on manufacturing a controlled substance necessarily proved the elements of manufacturing a controlled substance, manufacturing a controlled substance was a lesser included offense of child abuse based on manufacturing a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant challenged the order of the Jefferson County District Court, Colorado, affirming the suspension of her driver's license by appellee Colorado Department of Revenue, Motor Vehicle Division (Department), for the claimant's failure to provide proof of financial responsibility for the future, as required under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-7-103(14) and 42-7-406(1.5) (2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant's son was involved in two separate alcohol-related car accidents. In both accidents, he was driving the claimant's car. After the second accident, the Department sent a notice of suspension to the claimant, requiring proof of financial responsibility in the form of an SR-22. The hearing officer ultimately suspended the claimant's license, and she appealed. The appellate court ruled that the hearing officer did not err in requiring the claimant to submit an SR-22 in her name as such proof. The policy the claimant submitted, an SR-22 in her son's name, applied to the driver only, thus, she did not provide an assurance that someone would be responsible for damages regardless of who was driving. Also, the standard liability insurance policies the claimant submitted to the Department could be cancelled at any time without the Department being notified, and those policies did not provide an assurance that someone would be responsible for damages for future accidents, an assurance that would have been provided by an SR-22. Furthermore, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-7-103(14) and 42-7-406(1.5) were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A house in Castle Rock, Colorado was built in 1875. It was one of the last remaining structures from the town's founding era. Plaintiff purchased the property in 1998. When she applied for a demolition permit, the town council voted to approve an ordinance designating the property a historic landmark. Plaintiff filed suit asserting claims under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4) for review of a governmental body's decision and Colo. R. Civ. P. 57 for declaratory relief. The district court correctly concluded that the town's historic preservation code was not unconstitutionally vague. Its terms had a clear meaning to a person of ordinary intelligence. The Court of Appeals of Colorado held that the town council did not exceed its jurisdiction by allowing its staff to usurp the preservation board's authority by researching the history of the property, submitting a report, and advocating the adoption of a historic designation ordinance. The doctrine of equitable estoppel did not prevent the town from enacting an ordinance designating the property as a historic landmark. Plaintiff failed to establish an economic hardship.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the district court found that a prison sentence was more appropriate than a community corrections sentence and imposed a three-year term of incarceration. Defendant sought appellate view. On review, the appellate court held that the harsher sentence imposed on remand did not comport with the statutory resentencing requirements because the trial court did not rely on defendant's conduct occurring after the imposition of the original sentence or any other subsequent aggravating factors but imposed a sentence based upon what it would have done if it had been the original sentencing court; Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and several confederates agreed to steal money and drugs allegedly hidden inside the home occupied by the two victims and their parents.

While the kidnapping was occurring, another confederate entered the home, brandished a gun, and demanded that the second victim give him money. The confederate eventually shot the second victim, who suffered serious bodily injury. At trial, defendant's theory of the case was that he participated in the agreement and attempt to commit the robbery in which the group sought drugs and money, but that he did not intend or consider kidnapping the first victim. The appellate court ruled that because the jury unanimously agreed that defendant intended to commit aggravated robbery upon entry into the victims' home, any error in the failure to give a unanimity jury instruction was not plain error since there was no reasonable possibility that any error contributed to defendant's conviction. Also, the trial court misapprehended the applicable sentencing range.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Mesa County District Court (Colorado), defendant was convicted of possession with intent to distribute 1000 grams of a schedule II controlled substance (cocaine) under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-18-405(1)(a), (2)(a)(I)(A), and (3)(a)(III) (2007), and was sentenced as a special offender under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-407(1)(d) to enhanced incarceration of 16 years and one day. Defendant appealed the verdict and the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a police officer pulled defendant over for a traffic offense, the officer requested to search the vehicle. The search revealed the cocaine. The search was not unconstitutional because the circumstances indicated that it was consensual. Under the balancing test of Colo. R. Evid. 403, purported drug-courier-profile evidence was properly admitted because the evidence was testimony regarding how drugs were transported and it aided the jurors' understanding of an activity with which they were not likely to be familiar. Assuming, without deciding, that Crim. P. 16(I)(a)(1)(I) imposed a duty to disclose witness statements given to another governmental authority, the court concluded that any error in not disclosing an admitted statement made by a codefendant to federal investigators inculpating defendant was harmless because defendant knew of the statement but failed to request disclosure. Defendant's sentence was the minimum that could be imposed because (1) the special offender sentence was greater under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-405 than under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-407; and (2)&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-405(3)(a) required that the regimen producing the greater sentence apply.</SPAN></P>

The information put defendant on notice that she was charged under the theory that she accessed the system with the purpose of obtaining money from the Department, and she argued at trial that she believed the money she obtained belonged to her as it had been withheld from her paychecks.

The director's interpretation of soliciting, found in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-55.5-102(5) (2007), did not give effect to each word in the phrase in which the term was found. Giving effect to each word, a person who solicited on behalf of others who provided outfitting services was not an outfitter. The director exceeded her statutory authority by promulgating Colo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury awarded plaintiff damages for personal injuries resulting from defendant's negligence. Plaintiff moved for a modified judgment and an award of postjudgment interest. The Pueblo County District Court, Colorado, denied the motion for postjudgment interest calculated from the date of the accident. Plaintiff was awarded postjudgment interest, calculated from the date judgment was entered to the date of satisfaction. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue the court had to resolve was when postjudgment interest began to accrue on a personal injury judgment for money damages pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-101(1) (2007), in a case where a plaintiff was not entitled to prejudgment interest because it was not requested in the complaint. The plain language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-101 (2007) was ambiguous and contradictory with respect to the date postjudgment interest began to accrue. The court found that where a plaintiff was not entitled to prejudgment interest and the judgment debtor appealed the judgment, the plaintiff was entitled to an award of postjudgment interest calculated from the date judgment was entered to the date of satisfaction. Plaintiff failed to request prejudgment interest in her complaint. Thus, the court rejected plaintiff's contention that she was entitled to postjudgment interest calculated from the date of her accident. The trial court did not err in awarding plaintiff postjudgment interest calculated from the date the judgment was entered to the date of satisfaction. The trial court had no jurisdiction to award interest accruing before the date judgment was first entered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Adams County District Court (Colorado) found defendant guilty of two counts under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-405(1) and (2)(a)(I)(A) (2007) (manufacture of methamphetamine), and of one count under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-401(1)(c) (manufacture of methamphetamine with a child present). Defendant was sentenced to 12 years of intensive supervised probation and 90 days in jail. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived with his three-year-old daughter. After receiving a tip that defendant was manufacturing methamphetamine, a detective arranged to have an empty trash truck pick up defendant's trash so that the detective could inspect its contents. On pick-up day, defendant's roommate deposited the trash at the curb for collection. Police inspected the trash and discovered many items that are commonly used to manufacture methamphetamine, leading to their obtaining a search warrant. The court held that defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his trash once it was left at the curb despite the fact that defendant kept his trash locked up until trash day, kept it in sealed opaque bags, and relied on the fact that the trash truck used a mechanical arm to throw the trash in the truck. A chemical expert's testimony was properly admitted under Colo. R. Evid. 702. Defendant did not have standing to argue that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-401(1)(c) was overbroad because he was not charged under the portion of the statute contended to be overbroad. Section 18-6-401(1)(c) did not unconstitutionally infringe on parents' right to raise their children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of conviction entered in the Arapahoe County District Court, Colorado, on a jury verdict finding him guilty of harassment by stalking, violation of a protection order, and violation of a bail bond condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, defendant was charged with harassment and domestic violence based on telephone calls he made to the victim. That case was resolved by defendant's plea of guilty to violation of a restraining order. He argued that his conviction for harassment by stalking in the second case violated his right to be protected against double jeopardy. The Court of Appeals of Colorado disagreed. Under the Blockberger test, the elements of the harassment by stalking offense were different from the elements of violating a restraining order. The testimony regarding defendant's repeated threats and their effect on victim's mental state was sufficient to support the harassment by stalking conviction under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-111(4)(b)(II). The trial court properly declined to instruct the jury on the offense of misdemeanor telephone harassment. The trial court did not err in refusing to give an instruction requiring the jurors to agree unanimously as to which communications established harassment by stalking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's probation on an enticement of a child conviction was revoked by the Douglas County District Court (Colorado) on the grounds that he had violated several probation conditions. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of two years to life. Defendant appealed the order revoking his probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had authority to order a deferred sentence because until defendant was sentenced for child enticement, the Lifetime Supervision Act did not apply. The claim that the trial court could only order a deferred sentence if defendant was represented by counsel was rejected as Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-102 (2007) required the written consent of defense counsel only if a defendant was represented. Because defendant was pro se, counsel's consent was not required. The reliance on double and triple hearsay at the revocation hearing deprived defendant of his due process right to confront adverse witnesses where there was no good cause to deny confrontation or to find that the hearsay evidence was substantially reliable. Moreover, the evidence did not fall within a recognized hearsay exception, lacked meaningful detail, and contained material inconsistencies. Defendant was deprived of an opportunity to rebut as the prosecution did not disclose the declarants' identities until the day of the hearing. Defendant was entitled to a new hearing because without the hearsay evidence, the trial court could not have found that he knowingly violated several probation conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed. The case was remanded for a new evidentiary hearing to determine whether defendant committed the alleged violations or whether to revoke probation solely because he failed to maintain employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff theaters appealed a judgment of the City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado) denying their request for a preliminary injunction and a declaratory judgment against the enforcement of the Colorado Clean Indoor Air Act (Smoking Ban), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 25-14-201 to 25-14-209 (2007), by defendants Colorado Department of Health and Environment and its executive director as applied to theatrical productions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The theaters alleged that the Smoking Ban violated their constitutional rights under the First Amendment and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 10 because it precluded conduct that could be presented as part of certain theatrical productions. On appeal of the district court's judgment, the court affirmed. The court held that the Smoking Ban did not violate the theaters' right to freedom of expression because, under the intermediate level of scrutiny: (1) the Colorado legislature had the authority to enact statutes designed to promote the public health under Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1(4); (2) the Smoking Ban served an important governmental interest by protecting the health of Colorado's citizens; (3) the Smoking Ban was content neutral because it was justified by health concerns unrelated to expression; and (4) it was narrowly tailored, as it focused directly on the one form of conduct, smoking, upon which Colorado's announced interest in protecting public health depended. The Smoking Ban allowed other channels of expression, such as outdoor theatrical performances, and there were alternative channels for expression within indoor theaters, such as fake and prop cigarettes.</SPAN></P>

After observing the vehicle pull away with an inoperable headlight, the officers stopped it. While behind the vehicle, both officers observed defendant reach his right hand over the rear of the front seat and drop a small black object. When defendant opened his glove box, both officers observed a box of ammunition. One officer also observed a handgun on the floorboard where defendant had earlier dropped the black object. The officers arrested defendant for carrying a concealed firearm, and because there was no one to retrieve the car, the officers impounded the car and inventoried its contents, including the trunk, where one officer observed a knife with blood on it lying along the fender well. The other officer uncovered a gym bag containing ski masks, handcuffs, a baton, and other items. Both officers observed what appeared to be bloodstains inside the trunk.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the property division award, remanded for further proceedings, and affirmed the remainder of the judgment. The appellate court agreed with the husband's argument that the trial court erred in classifying a log cabin owned by his parents as marital property and dividing part of its value between the parties equally. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-113(1) and (2) (2007), the wife's objection to the husband's giving the logs and the cabin shell to his parents during the marriage did not preserve the wife's right to have the property classified as marital property under the Uniform Dissolution of Marriage Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-10-101 to 14-10-113 (2007). Further, the husband's father's intent to bequeath the cabin to the husband did not prove that the father had gifted his ownership interest in the cabin back to the husband and wife.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that Colorado's legislature had made it clear that, for the purposes of Colo. Rev.

It was undisputed that the set-aside conviction was for a felony in Michigan. Under Michigan law, the resident was not to be considered convicted of the set-aside felony, unless he fit within a specified exception. The set-aside conviction was for a drug offense, not for an offense involving weapons. Thus, none of the exceptions recognized by statute or in the Michigan attorney general's opinion applied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he had both a due process and a Sixth Amendment right to counsel before signing the consent to extend probation and waiver of his right to a hearing. He argued that because he was not aware of that right and the probation department did not advise him of it, his consent and waiver were unconstitutionally obtained, and the district court lost jurisdiction to extend, and subsequently to revoke his probation. The appellate court found that an extension or modification of probation was not analogous to a probation revocation proceeding. A consent to extend probation merely continued a defendant's status on probation, and, should the defendant eventually be faced with revocation proceedings, he would then be entitled to the limited due process requirements attendant to that procedure. Due process did not require that a defendant be advised of, or receive counsel, before requesting an extension of probation and waiving a hearing. There was no Sixth Amendment right to counsel at this stage in the process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Weld County District Court (Colorado) convicting him of aggravated driving with a revoked license in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-206(1)(b) (2007), driving under the influence (DUI) in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1301(1)(b) (2007), and driving without insurance and sentencing him to three years in community corrections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after a trooper observed him drinking a can of beer in a parked car and attempting to start the car once he saw the trooper. On appeal, the court held that even though the trial court did not instruct the jury that it had to find that the vehicle was reasonably capable of being rendered operable, it did not err because there was undisputed testimony that the vehicle's alleged inoperability was a result only of a lack of fuel and a dead battery. These circumstances, as a matter of law, did not render a vehicle not reasonably capable of being rendered operable. Because defendant did not raise the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 42-2-206(1)(b), 42-4-1301(1)(b) (2007), before the trial court, the court did not consider the issue on appeal. The court held that the trial court did not violate his right to due process in imposing an aggravated sentence of three years based on his five prior misdemeanor DUI convictions because a sentencing court could aggravated a sentence based on prior misdemeanor convictions pursuant to the prior conviction exception set forth in Blakely.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, parents and school districts, brought an action against defendants, the State and others, that questioned the adequacy of Colorado's school finance system under the state constitution. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under Colo. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(5). The City and County of Denver District Court, Colorado, dismissed the complaint for lack of standing and failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The districts contended that the trial court erred when it concluded that, as political subdivisions, they lacked standing. The court found that the districts were properly dismissed for lack of standing because the Local Control Clause, Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 15, did not give them authority to challenge how the Colorado General Assembly appropriated state funds to finance education. The parents had standing. The parents' claims were properly dismissed as a nonjusticiable political question because (1) the fashioning of a constitutional system for financing elementary and secondary public education in Colorado was not only the proper function of the Assembly, but this function was expressly mandated by the constitution; (2) the contours of a &quot;quality&quot; public education could not have been ascertained by judicially discoverable or manageable standards because the Education Clause, Colo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, provided no principled basis for a judicial definition; and (3) finding and enforcing the parents' standard of a constitutionally adequate, quality public education presented a substantial risk of judicial intrusion into the powers and responsibilities of the Assembly.</SPAN></P>

The mittimus was not revised to reflect a later restitution order. However, the state department of corrections (DOC) began garnishing defendant's inmate account.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion sought only to compel the DOC to show why it was garnishing defendant's account. The trial court ruled that the motion was without merit because the file contained the restitution order. On appeal, defendant contended that the restitution order increased his sentence after he had begun to serve it and, thus, violated double jeopardy principles and that the trial court violated his due process right to be present at sentencing when it entered the restitution order in his absence. The appellate court did not reach the merits of defendant's claims. According to the appellate court, (1) because defendant's challenges were to the constitutionality of his sentence, he should have filed a timely motion under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35; (2) nothing in the record showed that the trial court treated defendant's motion as having been filed under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35, as the trial court ruled only that there was no merit to the show cause motion and did not rule on any substantive claim regarding the propriety of the restitution order; and (3) accordingly, the motion was not a substantive postconviction motion and the order denying it was not a final appealable order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in 1992. In 1997, defendant was assigned a public defender to assist him in filing his postconviction petition. In 2004, the public defender filed a supplemental motion. The trial court held that the doctrine of laches applied and therefore dismissed defendant's petition due to the seven-year delay between defendant's letter seeking relief and the filing of the supplemental motion. On appeal, the court held that the doctrine of laches applied to defendant's case, as his letter was timely filed under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402. Even though the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the elements of laches had been satisfied, the court held that the ineffective assistance of the public defender, by failing to supplement the original Rule 35 motion for seven years, constituted excuse or excusable neglect. Because the court was unable to determine with particularity whether defendant acceded to the delay and waived his right to effective assistance of counsel, the case was remanded for a hearing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed, finding first that contrary to the trial court's determination, the attorney fees in this case were not part of the substance of the homeowner's breach of contract action against the tenants, nor were they sought as a legitimate consequence of that breach of contract. Further, the fee-shifting provision at issue was valid: the fees sought by the homeowner were based on the work performed during the underlying litigation; and the homeowner was &quot;required&quot; to initiate legal action against the tenants to obtain the relief she sought because the tenants denied that they were liable to her for the asserted damages. It was also indisputable that the homeowner was the prevailing party, as evidenced by the jury verdict. Nor was the attorney fee provision at issue a penalty and therefore void, as argued by the tenants. The trial court also erred in failing to address the homeowner's request for prejudgment and postjudgment interest, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5-12-102 (2007).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A few months after entering a plea agreement, the Mesa County District Court (Colorado) revoked appellant inmate's probation for retaliating against the victim and resentenced him to concurrent terms of one and two years in the Colorado Department of Corrections (DOC) for the felony menacing and criminal extortion counts, and one year in jail on the failure to leave the premises count. His motion for postconviction relief was denied. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was involved in an altercation with his live-in girlfriend, the victim. He pointed a gun at the victim and ordered her to undress. The victim responded by saying, effectively, that she would rather be dead. He then fired a shot next to her. Accepting the inmate's plea when the criminal complaint did not include an annotation indicating that the underlying factual basis for the charges involved an act of domestic violence or, in the alternative, requiring the prosecutor to represent that he or she could not make a prima facie case on the original charge, was a violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-801(3) (2007). However, because there was no dispute that the underlying factual basis included an act of domestic violence and the inmate was appropriately advised concerning the nature and consequences of his plea such that the placement of a domestic violence designation on the complaint would not alter his understanding of the agreement, the appropriate remedy for the trial court's technical violation of &sect; 18-6-801(3) was to remand the case to allow the prosecution to amend the complaint to include a domestic violence designation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's order denying the inmate's motion for postconviction relief, but remanded the case to the trial court to allow the district attorney to amend the complaint to comply with Colo.

On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's challenge to a prospective juror for cause on the ground that the juror had previously worked for a victim advocacy organization because the record indicated that she was not a compensated employee of a public law enforcement agency under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-10-103(1)(k) or Colo. R. Crim. P. 24(b)(X)(II), she had no familiarity with the facts of the case, she was not closely acquainted with the prosecutor, she did not have regular working relationships with law enforcement officers, and she was not familiar with any of the officers who would testify in defendant's case. The juror also made clear statements that she would be fair and impartial and follow the law. The fact that one victim cried before the jury when her sister carried her into the courtroom was not cause for reversal. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the victim's teenage sister to sit near her while she testified because there was nothing about her quiet presence that would unduly district the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a guilty plea to a felony sexual offense. He was given probation, but later violated the terms of such by drinking alcohol and staying out past his curfew. Defendant admitted the violations and requested a community corrections placement. The trial court accepted defendant's admission and imposed a sentence of 4 years in prison. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the five day time limitation in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-206(5) was not jurisdictional in nature because time was not of the essence, there was no negative language denying the exercise of authority beyond that time, and there was no injury to public or private rights. Further, defendant consented to a hearing outside of the relevant time period. Next, there was no viable Blakely challenge because the trial court unmistakably identified defendant's prior felony conviction as a basis for imposing an aggravated range sentence. Defendant's 4-year sentence was within the range authorized under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(A), (6) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-405.3(1) (2007), and the trial court considered the appropriate factors during sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant's appeal was pending from his attempted sexual assault on a child convictions, he received sex offender intensive supervision probation. After defendant refused to admit to any guilt in conjunction with the crimes for which he was convicted, his therapist recommended that the treatment program be terminated. The Arapahoe County District Court, Colorado, denied the State's request to revoke probation. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended defendant's probation should have been revoked as he refused to admit guilt to any of the crimes for which he was convicted, contrary to the rules of the treatment program. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendant had a reasonable fear of prosecution sufficient to pass constitutional muster concerning any admission to his therapist because the admission could have been used against him on retrial. In addition, he could have been subjected to charges of perjury because he had testified and denied the charges at trial. Hence defendant validly invoked his right against self-incrimination. Because of these circumstances, the State could not revoke defendant's probation and sentence him to imprisonment for an indeterminate term for, as a maximum, the duration of his life, based on defendant's invocation of his U.S. Const. amend. V right to remain silent. Defendant faced the &quot;classic penalty situation&quot; that the Fifth Amendment was designed to prohibit. Furthermore, defendant was in compliance with every other condition of probation except as related to an admission that he committed the acts for which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner association challenged a decision from the Colorado Division of Administrative Hearings, which assessed a penalty against it in a case involving an alleged violation of Colorado's campaign finance law. Respondent objector also appealed the method of calculating the penalty assessed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association paid for an advertisement regarding a political candidate. The objector contended that this violated Colo. Const. art. XXVIII. After it was determined that the payment and sponsorship of the advertisement transformed the association into a &quot;political committee&quot; under Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect; 2(12)(a), a penalty was imposed. The association contended that its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments were violated. Both parties sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that the fact that the association's activities here involved expenditures, rather that contributions, meant that the restrictions upon it were subject to strict scrutiny. The construction of the term &quot;political committee&quot; as applied to a non-candidate organization was known as the &quot;major purpose&quot; test under the Buckley case. This test was not included in the definition of &quot;political committee&quot; under &sect; 2(12)(a). A remand was necessary because, unlike the federal decision in Colorado Right to Life Committee, Inc., this record did not permit the appellate court to determine whether the &quot;major purpose&quot; test required by Buckley had been satisfied as to the association.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed, the penalty was vacated, and the case was remanded to an administrative law judge (ALJ) for further proceedings as guided by the federal decision. The ALJ was directed to determine if the association's &quot;major purpose&quot; was the nomination or election of candidates. It was also directed to make findings as to whether the association was a &quot;political committee&quot; and any other necessary findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Jefferson County District Court, Colorado, which convicted him after a jury trial of extreme indifference first degree assault, second degree kidnapping, and five counts of sexual assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his conviction for extreme indifference first degree assault had to be vacated because extreme indifference assault required proof of universal malice against human life generally, and not conduct directed against a single individual, and that his conduct was directed at a single individual. The instant court concluded that a finding of universal malice was not required to convict defendant of extreme indifference first degree assault under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-202 (2007). The trial court did not err when it admitted evidence that, seven years before the sexual assault charged in this case, defendant committed a sexual assault on a different victim in New Mexico, nor did it err when found the assault on the New Mexico victim occurred without providing defendant an opportunity to cross-examine her. There was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the victim in this case suffered serious bodily injury. However, the jury's finding of a class three felony aggravator had to be vacated because the evidence did not establish that defendant caused the submission of the victim by threatening to retaliate in the future against her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury's finding of the class three felony aggravator under Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for filing 13 lawsuits against the victim in violation of restraining orders that prohibited him from contacting her. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's facial challenges to the stalking statute, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-11(4)(b)(III) (2007), because the Supreme Court of Colorado had already held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad as applied to him. Because the constitutional right to access to the courts did not encompass the right to file lawsuits abusively in a manner designed to deprive another of effective access to the courts in his or her own defense, defendant's activity of intentionally filing lawsuits without notice to the victim, with the intention to use them to harass her and cause her serious emotional distress, was not constitutionally protected. The county in which defendant was tried was the proper venue to prosecute the possession of forgery devices and possession of a journal or seal charges, even though the computer disks on which those charges were based were seized from defendant's home in another county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was in his father's primary care since birth. Three years after the child's birth, the mother moved out of state. She saw the child only three times over the next three years and offered no support. The child believed that the stepmother was his biological mother. Neither the stepmother nor father corrected that belief. The stepmother petitioned to terminate the mother's parental rights and to adopt the child on grounds of abandonment. The trial court denied the requested relief. Affirming, the court held that the petition failed because the child was an Indian child who was subject to the provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1901 et seq., and the stepmother did not prove that active efforts were made to prevent the breakup of the Indian family as required by 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1912(d). The court held that the ICWA applied in stepparent adoptions and in situations where the child would remain with one biological parent after the adoption because any action resulting in the termination of the parent-child relationship and in a final decree of adoption was considered a &quot;child custody proceeding&quot; under the ICWA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Jefferson County District Court (Colorado) of robbery of an at-risk adult, aggravated robbery, and negligent bodily injury to an at-risk adult. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's argument that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6.5-103(2) (2006) created a sentence enhancer and not a substantive offense. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6.5-103(2) did not merely incorporate the elements of another offense. Instead, it combined several elements to create a separate substantive offense. Defendant's vagueness challenge to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6.5-103(2)(c) also failed. Although broad, the statute was not so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning. Additionally, any error in the jury instruction was harmless, as the error benefitted defendant by imposing a more demanding standard of culpability than the statutory standard. Further, defendant's convictions for aggravated robbery and criminally negligent bodily injury to an at-risk adult were not legally and logically inconsistent. However, defendant's conviction for robbery of an at-risk adult had to be vacated because it merged with her conviction for aggravated robbery under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-302(1)(c) (2006). Robbery of an at-risk adult was an enhanced form of robbery and not a separate offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated as to the conviction for robbery of an at-risk adult, and the case was remanded for correction of the mittimus as to that conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hospital challenged a decision from the Adams County District Court (Colorado), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff patient by requiring the hospital to purchase annuity contracts funded with the full amount of a jury award in a medical malpractice case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient suffered from injuries that occurred during his birth. A verdict was entered in favor of the patient, but this amount was reduced under the Colorado Health Care Availability Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-64-101 et seq. (2006). The hospital proposed funding an annuity at an even lower amount, but the trial court rejected this argument. The hospital then sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the trial court had the discretion to order the form and distribution of periodic payments under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-64-207(1) (2006). The hospital's reliance on Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 667.7 and California case law was misplaced because there was no requirement for the jury to record the gross amount of future damages in its verdict or for the trial court to use this gross future amount in determining periodic payments under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-64-205(1)(d) (2006). The trial court was not allowed to inquire into the deliberative process of the jury under Colo. R. Evid. 606(b). Finally, attorney fees under Colo. App. R. 38(d) were not awarded because the appeal was not frivolous in nature since an interpretation of the HCAA was proposed using California law.</SPAN></P>

The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the statute authorizing service by single publication, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-3-502(8)(b) (2006), was unconstitutional on its face and as applied because it did not provide her with actual notice of her legal rights before she lost custody of her child through adjudication. The appellate court rejected these arguments because any lack of notice which caused the mother to lose custody of the child resulted from her actions in concealing herself from law enforcement, the trial court, and the department during the adjudicatory phase. Further, the mother did not prove the statute was unconstitutional as applied because she did not show that the department did not exercise due diligence in trying to find her, at least before the trial court adjudicated the child, if not earlier. Based on these findings, which encompassed the four months between service by publication and the adjudication, the appellate court concluded that the mother lacked standing to raise a due process challenge to the statute because her claimed injury was self-inflicted. Since standing was jurisdictional, inquiry into the merits of the mother's due process arguments was foreclosed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that H.B. 04-1455 (Colo. 2005) was unconstitutional because it conflicted with Amendment 35 to the Colorado Constitution and violated the initiative power of the citizens of Colorado pursuant to Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. Contrary to plaintiffs' argument, there was nothing in Amendment 35 mandating a certain level of funding for health-related purposes. Although Amendment 35 provided that the revenues generated from it would be used to &quot;expand&quot; and &quot;increase&quot; health-related programs and services, it did not restrict the General Assembly's ability to change the amount of appropriations for health-related purposes with respect to other existing sources of revenue. Therefore, the General Assembly could set the appropriations at zero. Additionally, the court disagreed that Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 was violated. H.B. 04-1455 (Colo. 2005) did not impose restrictions that limit in any way the right of the citizens to initiate proposed amendments. Indeed, it did not even pertain to the initiative process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a determination of the Colorado Department of Revenue with regard to a state tax assessment. The La Plata County District Court (Colorado) granted summary judgment in favor of the taxpayers. Defendant, the Department's executive director, sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, two married couples, owned property as tenants in common. In January 2000, they donated a conservation easement on the property. Pursuant to a provision of the Conservation Easement Tax Credit Act then in effect, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-22-522(2) (1999), the couples split the market value of the easement ($154,700) and each took a tax credit of $77,350. In 2000 and 2001, the couples received tax credits and refunds for the conservation easement. However, in 2002, the Department promulgated a regulation, 1 Colo. Code Regs. &sect; 201-2, which limited to $100,000 the total credit generated by the donation of a perpetual conservation easement in gross by tenants in common. Relying on this, the Department issued notices of deficiency to recoup the credits and refunds. The court held that the 1999 version of &sect; 39-22-522(2), unlike an amended 2006 version, did not require tenants in common to split a conservation easement tax credit, and that the Department's attempt to alter the meaning of &sect; 39-22-522 by regulation was void. However, the court was unable to determine whether the 2006 version was retroactive, and, if so, whether its application would be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was vacated and the case was remanded for determination whether the 2006 amendment applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff special districts sued defendant developers, seeking to enforce statutory liens against the developers' property for failure to pay fees under the Special District Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1-101 et seq. (2006). The Gunnison County District Court (Colorado) entered judgment enforcing the liens, dismissed the developers' counterclaims, and awarded attorney fees to the districts. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The districts brought in rem claims to foreclose liens as a result of the developers' failure to pay availability of service or facilities fees (ASF). The developers asserted counterclaims based on alleged overpayments of ASF and other fees made by them and previous owners. The appellate court determined that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction because the service of the notice of intent was unnecessary to preserve the districts' liens because the liens were perpetual and perfected under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1-1001(1)(j)(I) (2006). No ASF were owed to one of the districts for 2002 and 2003, because the district's lease purchase agreement could not properly be used to calculate ASF, since it was not indebtedness within the meaning of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1-1006(1)(h)(I)(C) and (E) (2006). The trial court correctly determined that ASF were limited to budgeted debt service less the amount budgeted and expected to be produced by the mill levy allocable to such debt service as certified to the county by the districts. Also, the trial court erred in ruling that the districts were required to use amended budgets to calculate ASF. Certain counterclaims were untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed that aspect of the judgment in favor of the districts, foreclosing their liens on their claim for unpaid availability of service or facilities fees, late fees, and attorney fees, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The appellate court affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a postconviction motion claiming that his aggravated range sentence was unconstitutionally imposed and that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance.

Defendant also filed a supplemental postconviction motion alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant's supplemental postconviction motion had not been ruled upon at the time defendant filed his notice of appeal, the court declined to address it. Defendant was convicted of first degree assault under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-202(1)(a) (2006). That was a class three felony that was a per se crime of violence and an extraordinary risk crime. It therefore triggerred a special penalty range of 10 to 32 years. Defendant's sentence was within the special penalty range defined by the legislature. It therefore did not violate Apprendi or Blakely. The court also concluded that the district court correctly denied defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Because defendant failed to allege that the potential appellate issues were stronger or had a better chance of prevailing than the confrontation and insufficiency of evidence claims which appellate counsel raised in the direct appeal, the district court was correct in denying defendant's motion without a hearing. The bare allegation of failure to assert the additional claims did not overcome the presumption that appellate counsel's choice was the result of a strategic election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Arapahoe County District Court, Colorado, convicting him of racketeering activity under the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act (COCCA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-17-101 et seq. (2006), two counts of conspiracy to commit first degree murder, attempted manslaughter, prohibited use of weapons, false imprisonment, felony menacing, conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, and first degree criminal trespass.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his convictions should be reversed because he was deprived of his due process right to a meaningful and speedy appeal. The appellate court agreed. Defendant filed a notice of appeal in May 2002, and the five-year delay was clearly excessive and inordinate. Delays in the preparation of transcripts were generally attributable to the government, and it was generally appropriate to view defendant's filing of a notice of appeal as an assertion of the right to a speedy appeal. It was no longer possible to obtain a reliable answer to the factual questions presented. The witnesses on remand were unable to recall the pertinent events with any degree of specificity or certainty, and there was no reason to think that still further efforts toward reconstruction would be productive. Since the appellate court could not evaluate defendant's substantive contention, the appellate court found that he has been prejudiced by appellate delay and defendant was entitled to a new trial. Also, the COCCA was not so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado) of first degree assault, among other crimes. Defendant filed a postconviction motion claiming that his aggravated range sentence was unconstitutionally imposed and that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance for, inter alia, not timely seeking a Colo. R. Crim. P. 35 sentence reduction. The trial court denied defendant's motion and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of 32 years for first degree assault, 24 years for attempted murder, and 18 months for tampering with physical evidence. Defendant argued that he was entitled to relief under Apprendi and Blakely. Defendant did not receive an aggravated range sentence. First degree assault was a class three felony and a per se crime of violence and an extraordinary risk crime. It therefore triggered a special penalty range of ten to thirty-two years under the combined operation of four related statutes. Defendant's thirty-two-year sentence lay within the special penalty range defined by the legislature. It therefore did not violate Apprendi and Blakely. The appellate court also concluded that the trial court correctly denied all but one of defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Defendant sufficiently stated a claim that appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance in not timely seeking a reduction of his sentence pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(b).&nbsp;Thus, defendant was entitled to a hearing on his claim that counsel disregarded his timely instruction to seek sentence reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order was reversed as to the ineffective assistance claim concerning sentence reconsideration, and the case was remanded for further proceedings on that claim. The order was affirmed in all other respects. The part of defendant's appeal concerning the supplemental claims was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

She was charged with first degree murder and pled not guilty by reason of insanity. Her conviction was reversed on appeal. On retrial, the jury again rejected defendant's insanity defense and found her guilty of first degree murder. The appellate court concluded that defendant's contentions of error regarding jury instructions, prosecutorial misconduct, expert testimony, and hearsay evidence, whether considered singly or cumulatively, did not warrant reversal. The people cross-appealed regarding whether, inter alia, a 911 call was testimonial and had to be decided on a case-by-case basis, considering, for example, whether the call was made for the purpose of getting help or to provide information for investigative purposes. On appeal, however, the People made only conclusory statements regarding this inquiry, without specific citation to the record, beyond a reference to the tape itself, to support their statements. In these circumstances, the appellate court declined to disapprove the district court's ruling, and, instead, dismissed the cross-appeal as to this contention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Adams County District Court (Colorado) where he was convicted of two counts of attempting to influence a public official. Defendant claimed, among other things, that the statute he was convicted of violating, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-306 (2006), was applied to him in violation of his right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction, defendant sent &quot;notices&quot; expressly threatened two judges with &quot;arrest&quot; by a militia, an act in which the prospect of physical violence was inherent. They also threatened a &quot;charge&quot; of treason, an offense punishable by death. Defendant argued that &sect; 18-8-306 was unconstitutionally overbroad because his statements did not constitute &quot;true threats.&quot; While the appellate court agreed that the threats of violence prohibited by &sect; 18-8-306 were limited to &quot;true threats,&quot; it disagreed with defendant's contention that the People did not prove that his statements constituted true threats because the appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the First Amendment required the People to prove that he subjectively intended to threaten the judges. There was also no case law holding that a criminal defendant had a First Amendment privilege to threaten violence against a judge if he did so in the context of a pro se court proceeding. Finally, a reasonable juror could find, based on the evidence submitted, that the notices contained true threats, whether viewed from the perspective of a reasonable speaker or a reasonable recipient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the district court's judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

(2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board held a rulemaking hearing to consider a rule prohibiting pharmacists from dispensing prescription drugs resulting from Internet-based questionnaires, Internet-based consultation, or a telephonic consultation without a valid preexisting patient-practitioner relationship. The court first concluded that the agency substantially complied with the APA requirement of providing a statement of basis and purpose. The pharmacy and pharmacist next asserted that the Board had not maintained an adequate and appropriate record of the rulemaking hearing proceeding. However, the appellate court disagreed. The hearing was tape recorded and subsequently transcribed. The transcript contained numerous omissions, but the substance of and core testimony at the hearing appeared to be intact and was sufficient for public inspection and appellate review. Therefore, the appellate court concluded that the Board substantially complied with APA rulemaking provisions. Finally, the appellate court was satisfied that the Board's regulation of the sale and dispensing of drugs in this manner did not exceed its statutory authority and the terms and phrases in the rule were not vague or ambiguous.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-406(4)(b)(I) and (8)(b)(I) (2006). The Washington County District Court (Colorado) adjudicated and sentenced defendant as a habitual criminal pursuant to Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in his car when it was stopped. When defendant and the driver provided inconsistent answers to two troopers, the troopers questioned them again and asked for permission to search the vehicle, which defendant granted. The appellate court determined that defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied under the Fourth Amendment and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7 because the record supported the findings that, inter alia, (1) it was a consensual encounter at least until the troopers obtained reasonable suspicion, (2) only 15 minutes had elapsed between the stop and the consent, and (3) there was no coercive conduct. The trial court did not err in allowing the prosecution to use defendant's name and an alias, because the evidence was relevant under Colo. R. Evid. 401 to issues of identification, ownership of the car, and possession of the marihuana. Defendant's separate marihuana convictions were sustainable. A continuance of the habitual criminal hearing did not violate the statutory mandate of Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a workers' compensation proceeding, petitioner employer and its insurers, sought review of a final order of respondent Industrial Claim Appeals Office (panel), which affirmed the order of the administrative law judge (ALJ) that the average weekly wage (AWW) of respondent claimant should be recalculated to reflect her higher earnings from a subsequent employer and to include the cost of her group health insurance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer's argument, that it was denied its rights to equal protection and due process guaranteed by Colo. Const., art. II, &sect; 25, failed. The due process clause did not guarantee a party an order setting out every finding on which the order was based, and the employer cited to no examples of the pertinent AWW statutes being applied to other employers with a different degree of severity. Additionally, because a reopening under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-303(1) reopened an &quot;award&quot; and not just specific issues raised by a claimant in a petition to reopen, the ALJ properly determined that claimant's entire award had been reopened and that claimant was entitled to seek an increase in her average weekly wage. Also, the ALJ did not abuse his discretion in determining that claimant's AWW should be calculated based upon her wages nearly five years after she initially sustained her injury because the calculation was a fair approximation of claimant's wage loss. Finally, the ALJ correctly determined that claimant's cost of continuing health insurance coverage should be included in her AWW despite her decision not to purchase continuing coverage from employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, property owners, appealed from the Gunnison County, Colorado, District Court which dismissed their Colo. R. Civ. P. 57, 106(a)(4) and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims against defendants, a town and a developer. The court held it lacked jurisdiction to hear the owners' state law claims. Regarding the owners' facial constitutional challenge and their &sect; 1983 claim, the court determined that the owners did not have a protected property interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners were absentee owners of a property in the town containing three townhouses that had unobstructed mountain views. The developer filed an application with the town planning commission to develop a parcel of land adjacent to the owners' property. Because the owners' claims for declaratory relief under Colo. R. Civ. P. 57 that sought review of quasi-judicial decisions were untimely, there were properly dismissed. Although the owners' claim against the town for monetary damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 also sought review of quasi-judicial decisions, it requested a uniquely federal remedy and, therefore, was not subject to the filing deadline of Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(b). However, the owners pointed to no provision in the town zoning code, nor did the court find any, that forbade the elimination of scenic views or required the planning commission to deny building permit requests for structures that would adversely affect existing scenic views. Because the owners did not have any constitutionally recognized property interest in the preservation of scenic views, the owners also did not have a protected property interest in notice of and participation in the proposed design review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court which granted judgment in favor of the town and the developer was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff real estate broker, oil company owner, and paint company sued defendant Governor and State Treasurer, alleging that cash transfers from certain special funds violated the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR), Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20, and Colo. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 3-4. The City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado) dismissed several claims and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual claims of the broker and owner were moot as the funds at issue had either been abolished or the transfers had been repaid. Plaintiffs had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the cash fund transfers because they had an interest in having general tax dollars spent in compliance with TABOR and Colo. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 3 and 4. The paint company lacked standing to raise individual challenges as it did not pay the workers' compensation surcharges. The acts authorizing the transfers from the cash funds into the general fund did not violate TABOR as the transfers did not change the special funds into tax funds. The acts also did not violate Colo. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 3 and 4, because, with the exception of three funds expressly described as trusts, the cash funds were not public trusts. The legislature had the authority to transfer the special funds into the general fund as none of them were constitutionally created and thus, they were subject to the legislature's inherent power to alter or amend them. The transfers did not create debt as they did not pledge future revenues or revenues from taxes that were otherwise available for general purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the order concluding that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their constitutional claims and granting defendants summary judgment as to the Colorado children's trust, the severance tax trust fund, and the unclaimed property trust fund was reversed. The case was remanded to reinstate the constitutional claims as to those three funds and for further proceedings. The judgment and order were otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fremont County District Court (Colorado) denied defendant's motions to suppress and for acquittal. Defendant was convicted of sexual exploitation of children (possession of sexually exploitative materials) under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-403(3)(b.5) (2006), unlawful manufacture of a schedule II controlled substance under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-405(1)(a) (2006), and unlawful possession of a schedule II controlled substance. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on allegations against defendant's father, officers executed a warrant to search his parents' home for child pornography, drugs, and firearms. The officers searched defendant's room, which he allegedly rented from his parents. The appellate court determined that the search of defendant's bedroom was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7 because the facts known to the officers established that defendant's father, the person whose unlawful activities formed the basis for the search warrant, had ready access to defendant's bedroom. The special offender provision established by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-407(1)(f) (2006), under which defendant was sentenced for the possession conviction, was not unconstitutionally overbroad as applied, because the handgun found in his bedroom appeared to be capable of firing a bullet. Sufficient evidence supported the manufacturing conviction because items indicative of a methamphetamine manufacturing operation were found. Sufficient evidence supported the sexual exploitation of children conviction because defendant used a computer that contained numerous images depicting children engaged in sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tenured professors brought two claims in an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellee the board of trustees of a metropolitan state college alleging that the 2003 changes to the handbook breached their employment contract and denied them due process. The City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado) held there was no breach of contract and dismissed the due process claim. The professors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board asserted it had both statutory and contractual authority to modify the employment handbook provisions incorporated into the employment contract. Inter alia, the appellate court held that to the extent certain tenure provisions in the 1994 handbook afforded the professors vested rights, the board did not have statutory or contractual authority to unilaterally modify those provisions or to dismiss the professors. The intent of the 2004 handbook was to modify the original employment contract between the faculty and the college and to apply it retroactively to the professors. The appellate court held that the 2003 changes to the priority and relocation provisions, involved substantive rights, but that the remaining changes were procedural. The rights to priority and relocation could not be characterized as procedural because they laid at the heart of the concept of tenure; tenure provided job security and, thereby encouraged academic freedom. The loss of that job security in the event of a reduction on force (RIF) would strip tenure of its very substance. The rights to priority and relocation were essential to the contractual right to tenure and were substantive in nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed to the extent the trial court: (1) held that the president's decision of dismissal was final; and (2) denied the professors' claims regarding their tenure rights to priority and relocation. The case was remanded for a determination whether certain provisions of the handbook regarding priority and relocation involved vested rights, and, if so, whether those changes were retrospective. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution did not request that defendant be examined by another expert simply because the prior experts' opinions regarding his sanity were not favorable, but rather, because the prior experts' opinions were incomplete, that was, a potentially new and significant diagnosis had been proposed that could dramatically affect an assessment of defendant's behavior on the day of the incident. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting another examination under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-106(1) (2006). Also, because no evidence had been presented that defendant's mental condition was unconnected to his use of drugs, the evidence was insufficient to support an insanity defense and to require the prosecution to prove defendant's sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's mid-trial motion for acquittal. Finally, because reasonable minds could differ about whether defendant's conscious objective was to stab or kill demons or to stab and kill humans, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions for first degree murder and first degree assault, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-102(1)(a), 18-3-202(1)(a) (2006).</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-403(3)(a), (b), and (b.5) (2006). The Jefferson County District Court (Colorado) ordered the prosecutor to reassemble 31 of the counts by victim rather than by image, which effectively resulted in the dismissal of 11 of the original charges. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant pertained to the alleged possession and production of photographic images of children engaged in various acts of explicit sexual conduct. Several different counts involved photographs of the same child, sometimes in a different pose or act. The trial court ordered that the counts be restructured to avoid juror confusion and potential inconsistent verdicts. The appellate court determined that the trial court's dismissal of 11 of the counts filed against defendant violated the separation of powers doctrine under Colo. Const. art. III. The grounds of juror confusion and potential inconsistent verdicts did not provide a permissible basis on which effectively to dismiss charges otherwise properly filed. Also, constitutional principles of double jeopardy and multiplicity under U.S. Const. amend. V and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 18 did not require the charges to be grouped by victim rather than by image because, under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-403, each offending image constituted a separate and distinct sexual exploitation and therefore was a separate, chargeable offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado) denying his Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence. The trial court treated the motion as having been brought pursuant to Rule 35(c) because it challenged the constitutionality of defendant's sentence and held that it was time barred pursuant to Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court concluded that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion because all of his claims were time barred. Defendant's claims--that the trial court aggravated his sentence in violation of Apprendi and Blakely, that the trial court sentenced him to two punishments for the same crime in violation of the Fifth Amendment prohibition against double jeopardy, that the Colorado Sex Offender Lifetime Supervision Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-1001 et seq. (2006), violated his equal protection and due process rights, and that his due process rights were violated because the trial court used an unreliable test in sentencing him--were cognizable under Colo.

Defendant's claim that he was not given the complete range of psychological and physiological testing required for his sex offender evaluation before he was sentenced was properly brought under Rule 35(a) but had to be asserted within 120 days of sentencing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver sought judicial review of the decision by the Jefferson County District Court (Colorado) affirming the revocation of his driver's license by the Colorado Department of Revenue based upon his refusal to submit to testing as required by the express consent statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1301.1 (2006).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's due process rights were not violated. He did not dispute that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1301.1(2)(a)(II) (2006) applied to his circumstances and that he did not have the option of choosing a breath test. The record also reflected that the deputy fully complied with the requirements of &sect; 42-4-1301.1(2)(a)(II) by offering the driver a blood test. Because the driver was given the clear choice of either consenting to or refusing the blood test, his due process rights were not violated. Next the driver argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1301.1 (2006) violated his rights to equal protection under the federal and state constitutions. A rational basis existed for the statute's differential treatment of individuals who received medical treatment at locations without breath testing equipment because providing such individuals with the option of choosing a breath test would cause delays in obtaining test samples. Finally, &sect; 42-4-1301.1 was not unconstitutionally vague. The words and phrases of &sect; 42-4-1301.1 were readily comprehensible to persons of ordinary intelligence without further definition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who, 17 years earlier, had been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, sought review of a decision of the City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado), which denied his motion for postconviction relief under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to initiate plea negotiations because defendant adamantly maintained his innocence before and after trial. Further, it would have been speculative to conclude that there was a reasonable possibility that defendant would have accepted a plea bargain, and the trial court made sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the allegations. In addition, the trial court did not err in concluding that defendant's allegation of instructional error did not state a cognizable claim under Rule 35(c). Although the People, having not raised the issue in the trial court, could not assert the affirmative defense of abuse of process, the trial court did not err in denying the claim without a hearing because it did not raise a constitutional claim, and, further, there was no due process right in a lesser included offense instruction. Finally, the trial court did not err in denying the motion without a hearing because it, together with the files and the record, clearly established that defendant was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been convicted of first degree murder and attempted first degree murder, appealed an order of the Arapahoe County District Court, Colorado, denying his motion for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court held that defendant was entitled to relief on his first postconviction claim that the trial court plainly erred when it gave an erroneous jury instruction on, and allowed the prosecutor to make erroneous statements about, self-induced intoxication under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-804(1) (2006). It reached this conclusion based on a change in the law that occurred after defendant was tried but before his conviction was final. The instruction improperly focused on whether, as a result of self-induced intoxication, defendant lacked the capacity to form specific intent, instead of whether he in fact formed specific intent. The prosecutor exacerbated the instruction's deficiency by telling the jury that intoxication was irrelevant to the element of deliberation. The instruction and prosecutor's comments were plainly erroneous because the law at the time of trial was settled and contrary to the law in effect when the trial court considered defendant's postconviction claim. The trial court did not sufficiently address defendant's remaining postconviction claims. Although some of defendant's assertions were properly rejected, other assertions required additional findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying defendant's motion for postconviction relief was reversed, and the case was remanded. Regarding remedy, the trial court was directed to either order a new trial on the charges of first degree murder and attempted first degree murder or enter a judgment of conviction for second degree murder and attempted second degree murder and resentence defendant on those lesser offenses. The People would select the remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Voters passed the Campaign and Political Finance Amendment, Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, an initiative regulating campaign financing. The district court found that the unions had shown a reasonable probability of success on the merits as to their allegations that the Secretary exceeded her authority and that the rule violated the First Amendment. The court affirmed, noting that the district court referred to the Rathke standards in its ruling. Also, the district court clarified that it was enjoining the enforcement of Rule 1.14(b) as applied to the unions. The court agreed that the rule imposed a restriction that was not supported by Colo. Const. art. XXVIII. The Secretary's definition of &quot;member&quot; was neither a reasonable interpretation nor consistent with art. XXVIII. Even applying an intermediate review, the court concluded that the unions showed a reasonable probability of success on their First Amendment freedom of association claim in that by employing an &quot;opt out&quot; procedure, the unions complied with constitutional requirements. Yet Rule 1.14(b) effectively denied the First Amendment rights of the majority of union members for the benefit of dissenting members.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the victims was shot in the ankle in defendant's home.

Defendant asserted the trial court erred in admitting the victim's videotaped statement, without previously viewing the tape. He also asserted only those portions of the videotape should have been admitted that were consistent with the direct examination testimony. The appellate court disagreed; it was proper for the jury to consider all the statements the victim had given. Defendant cross-examined the victim on almost every aspect of his account of the crime. Further, defendant did not object at trial that there were new matters in the videotape. The appellate court disagreed with defendant's contention that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on complicity liability. The trial court in this case gave a properly reformulated instruction. As to the sentence, plain error review applied to an unpreserved alleged Apprendi error with respect to the felony menacing conviction. The error was obvious, and it so undermined fundamental fairness as to cast serious doubt on the sentence's reliability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on a class three felony theft by receiving charge. The court of appeals agreed. At the close of the evidence, defendant requested that the trial court give the jury an instruction on the class four felony offense of theft by receiving, arguing that theft by receiving was a lesser nonincluded offense of the robbery count. The People objected to the instruction, contending that the correct theft by receiving charge was the class three felony, because the evidence showed that defendant withdrew nearly $ 20,000 from the victim's checking account. The trial court granted the People's request and instructed the jury on the class three theft by receiving charge, as well as the class four theft by receiving charge. The court reasoned that defendant was on notice of the underlying facts supporting the class three felony. However, defendant was originally charged with the class four felony of robbery, but as a result of the People's tendered lesser nonincluded offense, he ultimately was convicted of a higher offense, namely the class three felony of theft by receiving. Accordingly, the trial court erred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for failing to drill a well pursuant to a farmout agreement he entered into with a company and for using the investors' money on personal expenses. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of a search of his home conducted pursuant to a warrant because after redacting the evidence obtained pursuant to an illegal search from the affidavit, it was reasonable that a search of the apartment would have occurred and the items discovered. When defendant was arrested, he dropped a brochure naming him as president of a well drilling investment program involving a different company than the instant company. However, the court reversed defendant's theft from an at-risk adult conviction because while the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference the trust and the corporation were victims of theft, it only showed that the individuals served as conduits for the money between the corporation and trust and defendant. The prosecution provided no explanation of whether or how either of the individuals had a possessory interest in the funds they turned over to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sustained an injury to his tailbone in 1997. He was denied permanent total disability benefits, but awarded future medical benefits. In 2004, he underwent back surgery. He filed a petition to reopen the 1997 claim, seeking additional temporary disability benefits. An administrative law judge (ALJ) denied the petition to reopen, finding that it was filed outside the time limits set forth in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-303(1) and (2)(a) (2005). The Panel upheld the order. On appeal, the court found that the petition to reopen was clearly filed more than six years after the accidental injury and more than two years after the last payment of disability benefits. The fact that the employee was entitled to the 2004 back surgery as a Grover-type benefit did not extend the limitations period for reopening his disability benefit claim. Because the employee's petition to reopen was not filed within the applicable limitations period, the ALJ properly denied it on that basis. Further, the ALJ's application of the time limits in &sect; 8-43-303 to bar the employee's petition to reopen did not violate his right to either substantive due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Panel's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a hearing in a workers' compensation proceeding, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found that, although the contract of hire between petitioner claimant and petitioner employer was executed in Colorado, no jurisdiction existed under the extraterritorial provisions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-41-204 (2005). The claimant and the employer sought review of the final order issued by respondent, the Colorado Industrial Claim Appeals Office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was a resident of the State of Washington. He was hired by the employer, a Colorado corporation, to work on out-of-state projects related to the installation of commercial lighting. He was injured when he fell off a ladder while working in Oregon. He was not present in Colorado during the hiring process or between the date he was hired and the date he was injured. The employer and the claimant contended that the ALJ and the Panel erred when they determined that the Division of Workers' Compensation lacked jurisdiction to hear the claim. Section 8-41-204 was the extraterritorial provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-40-101 et seq. (2005). Under the second sentence of &sect; 8-41-204, the claimant was only entitled to compensation for injuries received within six months of his physically departing from Colorado. The appellate court rejected the employer's and the claimant's assertion that where the employee was not physically present at the time of hire, the six-month period ran from the date of hire. The appellate court also rejected the argument that requiring a physical presence in Colorado violated equal protection and due process guarantees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners argued that the trial court erred in dissolving the injunction based on the Ratification Agreement, which approved the 1991 amended plat of Lot 2A, as well as various other changes. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that under the Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-33.3-101 et seq. (2005), the Ratification Agreement validly eliminated the building and access envelope on Lot 2A. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-33.3-117 expressly provided for application to preexisting common interest communities. The Ratification Agreement was signed by 70 of the 85 lot owners, thus, its approval was valid. The landowners were properly seeking an injunction to prevent imminent construction on Lot 2A. The trial court erred in determining the case was to construe the landowners' declaration, not to enforce it. Pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-33.3-123(1)(C), the landowners prevailed and were entitled to attorney fees. Eliminating the building and access envelope on Lot 2A was an amendment to the Declaration which required, but did not receive, three-fourths owner approval. The developer did not waive its right to construct multiple units.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order was affirmed as to the dissolution of the injunction and reversed on its order declining to award attorney fees, and remanded for further proceedings on attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Arapahoe County District Court (Colorado), which convicted him of unlawful sexual contact with force and unlawful sexual contact, Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court's jury instructions defining physical force, physical violence, and consent permitted the jury to find that he was guilty of unlawful sexual contact with force even though the force he applied to the victim's body was just or warranted. On appeal, the court disagreed. The instructions mirrored the language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-3-404 and 18-3-402(4)(a) (2005), and were, thus, adequate and proper. The court next rejected defendant's argument that Colo. R. Crim. P. 25 was violated because his present sentence, imposed as a result of his postconviction motion, was not imposed by the same judge who had presided over his trial and who had imposed the original sentence. Rule 25 did not apply to resentencing proceedings. Next, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in determining that he was not eligible for probation for the unlawful sexual contact with force offense. Finally, the court held that because the offenses defined by the two statutes that defendant violated had different elements and did not address exactly the same conduct, defendant's equal protection challenge had to be rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery, a class three felony. As part of the plea agreement, defendant stipulated to a 15-year sentence in the Department of Corrections and agreed that he would not file any Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(b) motions. Defendant contended that the imposition of his sentence violated his right to be tried by a jury at sentencing. The appellate court noted, however, that defendant was charged with a crime of violence. The appellate court further concluded that the presumptive range of penalties referred to in Apprendi and Blakely was only that portion of the sentence that subjected a defendant to incarceration or imprisonment. When a defendant received a sentence of imprisonment within the presumptive range established for the crime, plus a period of mandatory parole, the sentence was constitutional under Apprendi and Blakely. Defendant's sentence was within the presumptive range, and it was neither unconstitutional or illegal. Finally, the appellate court disagreed that the trial court erred in denying the defendant's motion without a hearing because the motion, the files, and the record clearly established that defendant was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant archdiocese challenged the constitutionality of an ordinance appellee Town adopted which restricted parking that affected church property. The Arapahoe County District Court, Colorado, granted the Town's motion for summary judgment and granted the archdiocese's request to stay enforcement of the ordinance. The archdiocese appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In granting the Town summary judgment, the trial court concluded there was no jurisdictional basis to apply the provisions of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc et seq., and that Colorado's Freedom to Gather to Worship Act (FGWA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-1-1201 et seq. (2005) did not apply to the ordinance in question. On review, the archdiocese challenged these conclusions. The appellate court found that the jurisdictional prerequisite under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc(a)(2)(B) was met as the rectory and the chapel on its property were religious buildings actively used as the site and dynamic for a full range of religious activities. As such, the activity sufficiently affected commerce to invoke jurisdiction under the RLUIPA. The RLUIPA also applied because the ordinance was only enforceable through an individualized assessment as the citizens had exclusive enforcement authority. Thus, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Town as there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the merits of the archdiocese's RLUIPA claim. Similarly, the trial court was wrong in finding the FGWA was a general parking law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner citizens filed a complaint with the Colorado Secretary of State's office alleging that respondent labor organizations illegally contributed to the campaign of a candidate for state senate. An administrative law judge (ALJ) dismissed the citizens' claims and denied the organizations' request for attorney fees. The citizens appealed, and the organizations cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the citizens contended the ALJ erred in concluding the labor organizations did not contribute to the candidate's campaign in violation of Colo. Const. art. XXVIII, &sect;&sect; 2(5)(a)(IV), 3(4)(a) of Colorado's Campaign and Political Finance Amendment, and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-45-117 (2005) of the Colorado Fair Practices Act. The appellate court agreed with the citizens that the organizations' coordinated activities in (1) receiving from the candidate's campaign thousands of flyers and numerous yard signs for distribution, (2) having the candidate make personal appearances at the volunteer site, and (3) discussing campaign strategy with the candidate's campaign manager constituted coordinated actions, and that the practical effect of the organizations' efforts was the same as if they had contributed a dollar amount to the campaign. Further, the organizations' collective, volunteer efforts went beyond individual volunteer efforts. The appellate court concluded that these coordinated activities constituted an illegal contribution. The ALJ adequately considered the probative value of evidence the citizens may have collected by trespass, and its admission was not arbitrary or unfair.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ALJ's order was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the ALJ was directed to consider the merits of the labor organizations' request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The petitioner argued that the trial court erred in not appointing new counsel to represent him at the evidentiary hearing on his Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion. The appellate court perceived no error in the manner in which the trial court proceeded. The petitioner's contentions were not factually or legally complex, and he was given an adequate opportunity to make his case to the court during the evidentiary hearing. The trial court, independent of its decision allowing counsel to withdraw, considered the petitioner's arguments and evidence before ruling on the merits of his claims. Also, the record was sufficient to support the findings that the petitioner was not coerced into entering into the plea agreement or that the plea was anything other than knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidates wanted to be placed on the ballot for United States President and Vice President. They contended that requiring unaffiliated candidates to file a statement 120 days before the general election was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In a hearing under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-1-113 (2005), the secretary was ordered to place the candidates on the ballot under the substantial compliance test of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;1-1-103 (2005). The constitutional issues were not addressed, and attorney fees were not awarded. Thereafter, the candidates sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that it had jurisdiction to hear the matter under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4-102(1) Next, the remedies of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-1-113 (2005) were not exclusive; therefore, an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was permitted. The appellate court determined that the candidates' case raised substantial constitutional claims for purposes of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The claims were not wholly frivolous, nor did they conflict with any United States Supreme Court decisions. The trial court improperly used the test applicable to unintended irregularities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court convicted defendant of harassment by stalking, a class four felony, and although the offense carried a presumptive sentencing range of two to six years' imprisonment, the court found extraordinary aggravating circumstances and sentenced defendant to ten years in prison. Defendant appealed, arguing that the district court violated the rule which the U.S. Supreme Court announced in Apprendi v. New Jersey when it determined her sentence, but state appellate courts denied her appeal. After the Supreme Court issued its decision in Blakely v. Washington, defendant filed a motion for correction of an illegal sentence, pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(a), arguing that her sentence was illegal under Blakely. The court of appeals held that (1) defendant's motion was not cognizable under Rule 35(a), but was reviewable under Rule 35(c)(2)(I); and (2) defendant was not entitled to relief under Blakely because the rule which the Supreme Court announced in Blakely was a new rule of criminal procedure that did not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, and defendant's conviction became final before the Supreme Court announced its decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent sought medical treatment at the authority's clinic after a business trip. She was improperly diagnosed with influenza, and she died shortly thereafter from malaria. The children then filed a wrongful death action against the authority. The case was dismissed and attorney fees were awarded. The children then sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that dismissal was appropriate on the claim for vicarious liability. The Colorado Health Authority Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-29-101 (2005) et seq., did not create a statutory exception to the corporate practice of medicine doctrine. A contrary conclusion would have defeated the expressed intent of the Colorado Legislature to preserve the corporate practice of medicine in Colorado. The authority's clinic was not explicitly authorized or required to practice medicine, and it was unable control the independent medical judgment of its employees. Attorney fees were mandatory after a dismissal under Colo. R. Civ. P. 12(b), and the successful defense of a dismissal order on appeal entitled the authority to those fees as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed, and the case was remanded for an award of attorney fees incurred on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in two consolidated cases with numerous felony counts, all arising out of his theft and forgery of checks totaling over $ 130,000 and his use of false identification to cash the checks. Defendant admitted having cashed the forged checks but raised the affirmative defense of duress, asserting that others were threatening to harm him and his family if he did not do so. Defendant argued that his habitual criminal sentence must be vacated because it was based on facts found by a judge rather than a jury. The appellate court ruled that the factual determinations made by the trial court neither deprived defendant of his constitutional rights nor rendered his sentence illegal. The fact that defendant was convicted of more than three prior felonies based upon charges separately brought and tried, and arising out of separate and distinct criminal episodes could be definitively established based on the judicial records introduced at the habitual criminal trial. Also, the jury instruction of the affirmative defense of duress was not legally and constitutionally deficient, because the instructions adequately made clear that the burden of proof remained on the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

Also, the evidence was sufficient to terminate the mother's parental rights because (1) the mother was pregnant with her third child; (2) although the mother had separated from the father, the trial court was concerned that the separation was not permanent as she still continued to have contact with the father; and (3) the trial court believed that the addition of a third child would frustrate the mother's ability to meet the other children's needs.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court also entered a judgment allocating permanent parental responsibilities of another child to the child's father. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's contentions about the child whose parental relationship was allocated to the father were not considered on appeal. As to the other two children, the mother asserted that she completed the significant portions of a treatment plan and that she would be available to parent the children within six months. The appellate court disagreed. Intervention was necessitated when one of the children was hospitalized at the age of two months with bronchitis and appeared malnourished. The other child was also underweight. In addition, mother had arrived at the hospital smelling of alcohol and appeared to be under the influence of substances, and she admitted that she drank alcohol during her pregnancy with one of the children. The caseworker testified that, despite having completed parenting classes, the mother was unable to attend to the children's needs during her visits with them. The children had special developmental and educational needs resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure and malnourishment. The findings of the juvenile court were supported in the record. Further, a finding that there were no viable alternatives to termination was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed an order of the Boulder County District Court (Colorado) that precluded the amortization of the sexually oriented business operated by plaintiff restaurant under a city zoning ordinance, and that upheld the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-1-101(3)(a) (2005). The restaurant challenged the trial court's holding that the judicial review provisions of the city ordinance did not violate U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed a zoning ordinance that limited the location of sexually oriented businesses to general industrial or mixed industrial zones and required the businesses to obtain licenses. The restaurant had been operating as a sexually oriented business and challenged the city's ordinance. The legislature passed Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 38-1-101(3)(a), which prohibited local governments from enacting ordinances that terminated or amortized nonconforming uses that were lawful at their inception. The trial court found that &sect; 38-1-101 prevailed over the city's ordinance. On appeal, the court held that although zoning regulations were typically a matter of local concern, &sect; 38-1-101(3)(a) was not a zoning regulation; rather, it addressed the statewide concern of protecting property interests against the unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation. Therefore &sect; 38-1-101(3)(a) prevailed over the city's zoning ordinance and did not violate the home rule amendment, Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 6. The court noted that because the city did not attempt to enforce the zoning ordinance until after the effective date of &sect; 38-1-101(3)(a), no retroactive application occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with second degree burglary and forgery. Defendant pled guilty to both offenses and was sentenced to three years probation and 180 days of electronic home monitoring. Defendant later violated his probation and was resentenced to three years of intensive supervision probation. As a condition of his probation, the trial court ordered defendant to submit biological samples for DNA testing pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-204.3. The appellate court ruled that the privacy interests of a probationer did not outweigh the governmental interests advanced by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-204.3(1)(b.5). DNA databases assisted in exonerating the innocent, solving past as well as future crimes, and deterring recidivism. The appellate court was not persuaded that the privacy interest probationers had in their biological samples outweighed the governmental interests advanced by DNA databases and justified a greater protection from warrantless searches and seizures under Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7, than that afforded by the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of an order from the Douglas County District Court (Colorado), which, pursuant to the dissolution of the parties' marriage, allocated decisionmaking responsibilities regarding the religious upbringing and medical care of the parties' child to appellee father. The mother also challenged the denial of her motions for relief under Colo. R. Civ. P. 59 and 60, and her motion for disqualification of the judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the dissolution of the parties' marriage, the trial court allocated decisionmaking responsibilities relating to their child's religious upbringing and medical care to the father, ordered that all other decisions should be shared by the parties, and increased the father's parenting time. The mother later sought relief under Rules 59 and 60, and sought to disqualify the trial judge. The trial court declined to recuse and denied the mother's motion for relief. On appeal, the court found that the order allocating the decisionmaking responsibility for the child's medical care to the father was supported by the record. Shared decisionmaking regarding medical care was not in the child's best interests pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-10-124(1.5)(b)(I) (2005) where the parties were utterly incapable of listening to one another. Finally, a special advocate's recommendation that the mother be allowed to continue to take the child to her church during her parenting time, but only so long as she supported the child's participation and attendance at church with the father as well, violated the mother's rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the adoption of the recommendation that the mother could be denied the right to take the child to her own church if she failed to support the child's participation and attendance at activities chosen by the father. The court affirmed the allocation of medical decisionmaking to the father. The court affirmed the denial of the mother's motions for relief and disqualification. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1996 the claimant suffered a back injury while working for the employer, and was referred to an authorized treating physician. After several months, the treating physician found that the claimant had achieved maximum medical improvement. The physician assigned an impairment rating of twenty-four percent. In November 2003, the claimant requested an independent medical examination (IME) so that he could contest the treating physician's findings regarding maximum medical improvement and the impairment rating. The employer argued that those issues were closed because the claimant's request was outside the thirty-day time limit imposed by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-107.2(2)(b) (2005). The administrative law judge (ALJ) agreed with employer, and the Panel affirmed the ALJ's ruling. The claimant argued that he was exempt from the thirty-day limit because he was requesting a follow-up examination. The court ruled that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-107.2(2)(b) governed both initial IME's and follow-up examinations.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 17-2-201(5)(g)(I) (2005) while he was in prison for an unrelated sexual assault. However, the special needs exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement permitted collection of blood samples from convicts for use in assembling a DNA database. He claimed the trial court erred by imposing an aggravated range sentence on the kidnapping conviction based on a finding of aggravators that were not determined by the jury. He committed the offense while on bond for a felony for which he was convicted by the time of sentencing in the instant case. Therefore, the trial court had to sentence him pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(9) (2005). His sentence was enhanced because he committed this kidnapping while on bond for a felony for which he was convicted, so because the prior felony was the event that triggered the enhanced sentencing, the enhancement fell within the prior conviction exception to the Apprendi rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contended a street light service charge and cable television charge constituted taxes imposed in violation of the state and city Taxpayers' Bill of Rights (TABOR). The appellate court disagreed, concluding the service charges under the ordinances were not taxes, but service fees. The parties conceded, the trial court found, and the appellate court agreed that the street light charge was not an ad valorem tax, an excise tax, or a special assessment. The street light service charge was reasonably related to the overall cost of operating street lights. Although the city might have chosen a different calculation for imposing the service charge, there was nothing inherently unsound in its methodology. Accordingly, the street light service charge was a special fee reasonably related to the overall cost of providing the city's street lights. The taxpayer also contended that cable television charges were actually taxes the city imposed on the cable provider, which were then passed on to consumers in violation of TABOR. The charges were not taxes, and thus, TABOR was inapplicable. The charges listed in the cable bill represented the cost of doing business with the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant's underlying theft conviction was a class four felony, and he had three prior felonies, the trial court was required to impose a sentence of 24 years, four times the maximum presumptive range sentence. Defendant argued that a 24-year sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment because his conviction stemmed from a commercial dispute and because his prior convictions were not sufficiently grave and serious. A threshold comparison of defendant's offense and sentence imposed yielded no inference of gross disproportionality. Defendant's triggering offense was theft of property worth $ 500 or more but less than $ 15,000. This was a class four felony under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-401(2)(c). At least two of defendant's prior offenses -- second degree burglary and attempted second degree burglary -- were crimes characterized as grave or serious for purposes of proportionality analysis. The sentence did not yield an inference of gross disproportionality under the governing precedents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Adams County District Court (Colorado) that found him guilty of retaliation against a witness under Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the information charging him was insufficient to invoke the trial court's jurisdiction because it omitted the requisite specific intent mens rea for the offense. The court noted that the requirement under Colo. R. Crim. P. 7(b)(2) that the information identify the essential elements of the crime was satisfied where the language in the information tracked the language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-706(1), which included the terms &quot;retribution&quot; and &quot;retaliation&quot; that were by definition required intentional conduct. The court held that defendant's conviction was supported by sufficient evidence that showed he sent a letter to the deputy district attorney (DA) explicitly communicating a threat, as opposed to a description of a fantasy, against the witness who testified against him in a prior drug case and that defendant expected the DA to inform the witness of the threats. The court held that nothing in &sect; 18-8-706(1) required that the threat be directly communicated to or received by the person protected under &sect; 18-8-706(1) but only that it be &quot;directed to&quot; such person. The court rejected defendant's claims that &sect; 18-8-706(1) was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Teller County District Court (Colorado) convicting him of possession of pseudoephedrine with intent to use it as a precursor in manufacturing a controlled substance (methamphetamine), possession of chemicals or supplies with intent to manufacture a schedule II controlled substance, and driving under restraint and imposing concurrent 10-year sentences on the drug offenses and six months on the driving charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress and by admitting the lay opinion testimony of police officers concerning the amount of Sudafed possessed by defendant. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress because the police stopped and arrested defendant after they observed him committing a traffic violation and found that his license had been revoked; thus, the search of his truck and seizure of drugs was incident to his lawful arrest based upon probable cause. The court held that the trial court erred in allowing the officers to testify that the possession of a large amount of Sudafed often indicated the possibility of manufacturing methamphetamine because it required specialized knowledge and thus constituted expert opinion testimony admitted without pretrial disclosure and expert qualification as required by Colo. R. Evid. 702. The court concluded that the lack of pretrial disclosure of the officers' expert testimony and the bases of their opinions deprived defendant of an opportunity to evaluate the testimony before trial or to obtain his own expert witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment as to defendant's two possession convictions and remanded the case for a new trial on those charges and further consistent proceedings.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeals from the judgment entered by the Montrose County District Court (Colorado) upon the 18-month sentence imposed following a jury verdict finding him guilty of failure to register as a sex offender, second offense. He also appealed the 18-month sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was serving a 90-day jail term. While incarcerated, he attempted to register as a sex offender but was informed that he was not allowed to register while incarcerated. He also did not register upon his release. The statute applicable to defendant required that he register quarterly and notify authorities of any change of address. The appellate court therefore concluded the offense of failure to register as a sex offender, under which defendant was charged, was a continuing offense and he was not entitled to acquittal. However, the variance in defendant's case required reversal and remand for a new trial. Defendant was charged with failing to register as a convicted sex offender &quot;on or about October 23, 2001.&quot; Defendant was given no notice he could be convicted for his failure to register on any date other than the one contained in the information. The evidence of defendant's conduct on occasions other than the day charged in the information impaired his ability to defend against the charge and prejudiced him in preparing and presenting his defense. Therefore, the variance constituted reversible error, and defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial. On remand, the trial court was to reconsider defendant's waiver of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested at a hospital after a doctor called a local pharmacy, which informed him that it had filled five prior prescriptions for defendant for narcotics in the prior month and that the pharmacy had a narcotic alert on him. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The appellate court perceived no vagueness. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-415(1)(b) (2005) operated as an exception to the physician-patient privilege found at Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-90-107(1)(d) (2005). When Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-18-415(1)(b) applied, there was no privilege and, thus, no waiver was required. The trial court properly instructed the jury regarding the presumption of innocence, the burden of proof, and the requirement that the prosecution prove each element of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence was substantial and sufficient to support the conclusion by a reasonable person that defendant obtained the prescription medication by deceit and misrepresentation; that is, by conveying a false understanding regarding the purpose of his visit, his medical condition, past treatment for it, and existing prescriptions for narcotic pain relief.</SPAN></P>

The conviction was affirmed on direct appeal but the appellate court declined to address defendant's equal protection challenge to her 16-year sentence because she had not raised it below. Thereafter, she filed a Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(b) motion for sentence reconsideration, asserting that her sentence violated constitutional equal protection guarantees. The trial court denied her motion. On appeal, she contended that the sentencing scheme under which she was sentenced violated equal protection guarantees. Defendant was properly sentenced. However, she contended that the conduct for which she was sentenced was also proscribed under the statutes addressing crimes against at-risk juveniles, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6.5-101, et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sustained an industrial injury in 1995 that included a traumatic brain injury and paralysis. As a result, the claimant was permanently and totally disabled. Because of the severity of the claimant's disability and his confinement to a wheelchair, cell telephone service for emergency calls was medically necessary for claimant and therefore was provided by the employer. The administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the claimant submitted requests for payment of the telephone charges to employer, and the employer neglected to pay those bills within the mandated time limits. While recognizing that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-43-304(1) (2005) allowed a penalty of up to $ 500 per day, the ALJ concluded that a penalty of $ 300 per day was sufficient to deter future violations, and the aggregate penalty imposed for the eighty-three days of nonpayment was $ 24,900. The court ruled that the penalty was not unconstitutionally excessive. The employer did not offer any evidence or explanation for its conduct, and the delays in payment had worked a hardship on the claimant's family, including the wife, who provided claimant with attendant care.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a schedule II controlled substance and unlawful possession of a schedule II controlled substance with intent to distribute in the City and County of Denver District Court, Colorado. He appealed, asserting that his confrontation rights were violated where a confidential informant was not disclosed and that his sentencing as a habitual criminal was in violation of the rule in Apprendi v. New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found defendant's claim was limited to the narrow question of whether, under the United States Supreme Court's decision in Crawford v. Washington, his right of confrontation was violated by the admission, at the pretrial suppression hearing, of hearsay statements made by an unidentified confidential informant. Crawford addressed a defendant's rights of confrontation at trial. The right to confrontation was basically a trial right. The protections afforded by the Confrontation Clause did not apply at pretrial suppression hearings. Thus, defendant's first claim was rejected. Defendant also argued that a detective's testimony at the suppression hearing, identifying him by his nickname, was hearsay that violated his right of confrontation because the detective learned the nickname from the confidential informant. However, any possible error was harmless because a codefendant testified at trial and also identified defendant by his nickname. Finally, as to defendant's sentencing as a habitual criminal under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-801 (2005), the prior conviction exception exempted habitual criminal proceedings from the constitutional jury requirement.</SPAN></P>

The police encounter at his hotel room was consensual; there was not a seizure. The evidence was sufficient to support his adjudication as a special drug offender under Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee county passed an ordinance creating a temporary moratorium on accepting, processing, and approving development applications concerning certain lands, appellant property owners sought a declaratory judgment that the temporary moratorium was void and requested injunctive relief. The Pitkin County District Court, Colorado, denied injunctive relief and granted the county a summary judgment. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the owners contended the trial court erred in concluding that the moratorium was authorized or permissible under the Colorado Government Land Use Control Enabling Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-20-101 et seq. (2005). The appellate court disagreed, holding that the ability to enact such a temporary moratorium was necessarily implied in the Act. The Act and the county planning statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-28-101 et seq. (2005), had different, though complementary, purposes, and the limitation on temporary zoning in the county planning statute did not prohibit or limit a moratorium on development for the purpose of studies under the Act. Finally, the appellate court disagreed with the owners' characterization of the moratorium as &quot;open ended&quot;; while the stated duration of the moratorium might have been read as &quot;open ended,&quot; it was nevertheless constrained by its stated purpose and its length measured by the time reasonably necessary to conduct the requisite studies and prepare the plans. Therefore, the trial court did not err in finding the county had authority under the Act to impose the temporary moratorium.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the employer's motion to dismiss pursuant to Colo. R. Civ.

On review, the employee contended the trial court erred in finding that the director was an indispensable party. The appellate court disagreed as the director was the very party charged with promulgating the rules and administering the Colorado Workers' Compensation Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-40-101 et seq. The employee also contended that the trial court erred in failing to give her the opportunity to join the director once it was determined that the director was an indispensable party. On this point the appellate court agreed; the trial court's reliance on the employee's failure to file a motion to join was not dispositive because the employee had no particular motivation to file such a motion until the trial court determined that the director was indispensable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the officer challenged the validity of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-40-202(1)(a)(I)(A) (2005) of the Workers' Compensation Act of Colorado on equal protection grounds, claiming there was no rational basis for allowing a governing body to exclude volunteer police from being considered employees under the Act, when all other similarly situated groups listed in the statute, whether regularly employed or volunteers, were deemed employees. The appellate court agreed, finding no valid purpose for allowing police volunteers to be excepted from workers' compensation coverage, while mandating that all other volunteers, who similarly served a vital function and were subject to similar risks and perils, be covered. Thus, even though reducing costs might have been a legitimate government interest, the appellate court concluded that the statute was not rationally related to achieving that purpose because it provided coverage for some volunteers but not others who were similarly situated. Therefore, the officer was entitled to relief from the harsh result of excluding volunteer police, at the government's option, from the definition of an &quot;employee.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the statements she made while under arrest for eluding were inadmissible. The court held that the police had probable cause to arrest defendant in that they had a warrant to arrest defendant's passenger, her cousin, and defendant did not come to a full stop until physically restrained by an officer. The court also held that the term &quot;suspected of&quot; in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-105(4) was not unconstitutionally vague because vagueness challenges to prior versions of the accessory statute had been previously rejected, and the court found no grounds for reaching a contrary conclusion. However, the cousin's guilty plea was improperly admitted because it was testimonial under Crawford. Further, under either Crawford or the Roberts-Dement test, the victim's statements made to an officer were inadmissible because defendant did not have opportunity to cross-examine the victim and the prosecution made no showing of the victim's unavailability. The court reversed because the improperly admitted statements were central to establishing an element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a mother and a conservator, brought a negligence complaint against appellee city after the son died and the conservator was injured when they fell into a storm ditch owned and operated by the city.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the General Assembly clearly intended the 2003 legislation amending the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (GIA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-101 et seq., to expressly exclude storm water facilities from the definition of &quot;public sanitation facility&quot; to be retroactive. Appellants argued that this was error. The appellate court determined that there was no clear legislative intent that the pertinent statute was to be applied retroactively. Given prior decisions before the adoption of the GIA, the court must have been expected to conclude that drainage facilities fell within the concept of &quot;sanitation facilities&quot; for purposes of municipal liability. The analysis of the separation of powers doctrine under the federal constitution was equally applicable to a consideration of the proper exercise of governmental powers under the state constitution. Any resulting final appellate determination of the jurisdiction of the court under the GIA rendered in a proceeding under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-108 had to be treated as a final judicial resolution of that issue. The appellate court could not interpret the statute as having a retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified that defendant penetrated her digitally and raped her. The police recorded a phone conversation between the victim and defendant during which defendant apologized to her for what he had done. During police questioning, defendant, who had not been Mirandized, initially insisted that he had consensual sex with the victim; after an officer told him of the tape recording and accused him of rape, defendant admitted to a detective that he raped the victim. The trial court excluded expert testimony about his developmental disability on the basis that mental retardation was a mental condition within the meaning of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-107(3) (2004) and defendant had waived this defense by not raising it at arraignment. The appellate court held that this was reversible error. Defendant sought to admit this evidence not to support a impaired mental condition or insanity defense but only to attack the credibility of his statements to police and his apology to the victim by showing that he was highly susceptible to suggestion, especially by persons of authority. Thus, &sect; 16-8-107(3) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-103.6 were inapplicable and the evidence was admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City and County of Denver District Court, Colorado, affirmed appellee Denver Career Service Authority Board's (Board) denial of administrative review regarding plaintiff employees' requests for classification to higher pay grades. The employees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees argued that the amendments to Career Services Rules 19-10 and 7-66 were not properly adopted as notice was not published in the official newspaper of record. The appellate court found that the rule amendments were the result of a quasi-legislative proceeding that had to be reviewed pursuant to Colo. R. Civ. P. 57. The effectiveness of the amendments could not be reviewed under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106(a)(4). The matter was not within the scope of the appellate court's review as the employees did not seek leave to amend in the district court. There was no indication that the Board intended simply to clarify the law by amending the rules to eliminate administrative appeals; therefore, the appellate court deferred to the Board's conclusion that amendment of Career Services Rule 19-10 and the repeal of Rule 7-66(h) changed the law and eliminated the right to appeal the classification decision of the Personnel Director. Retroactive application of the amendments was reasonable and warranted by the record. This application was merely procedural or remedial and did not impair a vested right. The Board was not equitably estopped from declining to hear the employees' appeals.</SPAN></P>

The victim testified in detail regarding statement that she made to the psychologist during the counseling sessions. Thus, she waived her psychologist-patient privilege. Defendant had yet to establish that the trial court's error was of constitutional dimension, so the court remanded for the trial court to make that determination. The psychologist was to testify and the trial court was to determine whether her testimony would have been material to the case, Colo. R. Evid. 103(a), Colo. R. Crim. P. 52(a), and Colo. App. R.35(e). After hearing the testimony, the trial court was to determine whether the evidence, had it been admitted at trial, would have affected the outcome of the case. Although a comment by the prosecutor was improper, in the context of the entire argument and in light of the other evidence before the jury, the court concluded that it was not flagrantly, glaringly, or tremendously improper as to warrant reversal.</SPAN></P>

The actions of the officers were objectively reasonable and proper, and the resulting search of the passenger compartment incident to his arrest did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. In addition, the court held that his sentence was improper pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-206 (2004) because his driving offenses did not amount to grave and serious crimes. While the court recognized that State did have a valid interest in preventing drivers from driving with revoked licenses, an offense under &sect; 42-2-206 was essentially a violation of an administration order. Without additional evidence indicating a greater degree of danger to he public, the two driving offenses could not be considered grave and serious offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The medical malpractice action arose from the death of the husband's wife. Plaintiffs argued that the trial court erred in finding that the supervisor was a public employee for purposes of the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (GIA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-101 (2004) et seq. The appellate court found that although plaintiffs argued that it was unfair and illogical to allow the supervisor, who was a doctor engaged in private practice, to be covered by the GIA when the doctor was supervising a resident at a private hospital, the policy choice had been made by the Colorado General Assembly. Based on the General Assembly's definition of &quot;public employee&quot; in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-10-103(4)(b)(II) (2004), the trial court did not err in determining that the supervisor was a &quot;public employee&quot; for purposes of the GIA. Also, neither the GIA nor the Wrongful Death Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-201 (2004) et seq., limited plaintiffs collective recovery to $ 150,000. Each plaintiff potentially could recover the maximum amount of $ 150,000 in damages in the wrongful death action, up to a collective limit of $ 450,000.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat &sect; 18-18-405(3)(a) (2004). An informant had set up a buy from defendant and police found a wrapped block containing 1004.5 grams of white powder, which tested as cocaine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the admission of a laboratory report on the block of cocaine violated his right to confrontation under Crawford v.

Stat. &sect; 16-3-309(5) (2004), which allowed admission of laboratory reports without the testimony of the preparing technician if a defendant failed to give notice and demand that the technician testify. On appeal, the court held that defendant failed to preserve his constitutionality challenge of &sect; 16-3-309(5) for appeal. The court also held that the report was not &quot;testimonial&quot; and thus, Crawford did not require its exclusion; and that the report was admissible under the hearsay business record exception in Colo. R. Evid. 803(6). The court found that any error resulting from the admission of the police officer's testimony regarding the informant's statements was harmless because defendant objected in part and the objected-to hearsay testimony was cumulative of the unobjected-to hearsay. The court rejected defendant's claims of error regarding the jury instructions, his Batson challenge, the prosecution's remarks, and his sentence.</SPAN></P>

The employees appealed the Colorado State Personnel Board's decision concluding that the actions of the education center in failing to transfer the employees were not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the transfer of administrative control, the media center's structure was modified only by a reduction in the number of positions, and the positions continued to be substantially similar. The employee who worked as an electronic specialist filed an application for a transfer to the education center, but the other employee, who worked as a media specialist, did not. The media specialist signed a notice of intention to exercise his retention rights, but the electronic specialist did not. Because the education center did not consider seniority or performance as required by Colo. Dep't Pers. Regs. No. 7.4, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the education's center's actions with respect to the electronic specialist were arbitrary and capricious. On appeal, the court held that the ALJ's findings were supported by the evidence and that the Board's reversal of the ALJ's conclusion had no reasonable basis. By failing to apply for a position with the education center, the media specialist did not provide notice of his intent to protect his tenure right; thus, the media specialist was precluded from challenging the education center's hiring decisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Board's order regarding the media specialist, reversed the Board's order regarding the electronic specialist, and remanded the matter with directions to reinstate the ALJ's order requiring the education center to appoint the electronic specialist pay him back pay and benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dependency or neglect proceeding, the Morgan County District Court (Colorado) awarded permanent legal custody of appellant father's child to appellees, the child's maternal grandfather and his wife (grandparents). The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to the child's mother's drug use and neglect, the trial court sustained the department of social service's petition in dependency or neglect and placed the child in the grandparents' temporary custody. The father reasonably complied with a treatment plan, but after he separated from his girlfriend and moved to another city, his instability caused the department seek an award of custody to the grandparents. The trial court did not find the father unfit but found him &quot;unsuitable&quot; to be the custodian based on his instability and drug use. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in relying on Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 19-1-102, -104, -115, and 19-3-508 (2004) in awarding the grandparents permanent custody. As the dependency or neglect proceeding had been pending for over 12 months when the department sought permanent custody, the trial court should have applied Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-3-702 (2004). It rejected the father's argument that the custody order was erroneous because he had not been deemed unfit; under the dependency or neglect statutes, an award of permanent custody to a nonparent could be made even if a parent was not found to be unfit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated, and the case was remanded with directions to determine the issue of permanent custody in accordance with the applicable statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate filed a postconviction motion under Colo. R. Crim. P.  35(c), alleging, inter alia, that his postconviction counsel provided ineffective assistance and had a conflict of interest. The Mesa County District Court (Colorado) denied the motion on grounds that it was untimely; he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate also challenged his conviction, his sentence, and the effectiveness of appellate counsel. The appellate court held that as the time bar in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-402(1) was not tolled during the litigation of the inmate's first postconviction motion, his second motion was untimely as to all claims except those involving postconviction counsel's alleged ineffectiveness and conflict of interest. The inmate alleged his postconviction counsel, a deputy public defender, had a conflict of interest because the inmate had alleged ineffective assistance against another deputy public defender, now postconviction counsel's superior, who had briefly represented the inmate before appointment of alternative defense counsel for the trial. The inmate's ineffective assistance claims, other than the alleged conflict of interest, failed because he had no constitutional or statutory right to postconviction counsel. However, under Coleman, appointment of counsel with a conflict of interest could constitute a &quot;factor external to the defense&quot; impeding counsel's efforts, akin to &quot;interference by officials&quot;; therefore, that claim was cognizable in a postconviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed solely as to the dismissal of the inmate's claims that his postconviction counsel had a conflict of interest. On remand, the district court had to determine if justifiable excuse or excusable neglect existed for the untimely filing and if so, whether a separate hearing was required on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant appealed a final order of the Panel determining that her claim for temporary and permanent partial disability payments against her employer was subject to the $ 60,000 benefit cap in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-107.5 (2004). The court affirmed, stating that based on the legislative history and the purpose of the statutory changes, it agreed with the employer and Panel that a mental impairment rating could not be combined with a nonscheduled impairment rating to determine whether a claimant's whole person impairment exceeded 25 percent for purposes of determining the applicable benefits cap under &sect; 8-42-107.5. Accordingly, the court concluded that the Panel correctly determined that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-107(7)(b)(III) (2004) precluded the administrative law judge from combining a claimant's mental impairment rating with the nonscheduled impairment rating to determine the applicable cap under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-107.5. The court further rejected the assertion that the Panel's interpretation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-42-107.5 and 8-42-107(7)(b)(III) violated her rights to equal protection and substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court interpreted the requirement in the definition of &quot;erotic nudity&quot; that the material be for the purpose of real or simulated overt sexual gratification or stimulation of one or more of the persons involved subjectively, so as to refer only to the sexual gratification of defendant. The People asserted that the trial court erred in adopting a subjective test to define &quot;erotic nudity&quot; and in instructing the jury according to that definition. The People argued that an objective test, so as to include a reasonable viewer of sexual materials that have been distributed, furthered the intent of protecting children from sexual exploitation. The appellate court ruled that the trial court erred in its ruling limiting the scope of the statute subjectively to defendant, and rejected defendant's argument that extending the meaning of &quot;involved&quot; objectively to others who view such material would render the statute unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The People must prove that a person knowingly took sexually explicit photographs of a child and that the content of those photographs, viewed objectively, would lead to sexual gratification or stimulation of a reasonable viewer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the State's answer brief should have been stricken because it was not timely filed. The appellate court disagreed, ruling that under Colo. App. R. 26(b), it was authorized to grant extensions of time for good cause shown. To the extent that defendant raised cognizable claims under the habeas corpus statute, the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to address them. Defendant's claims regarding the suppression of certain evidence at trial were not habeas claims, but instead were cognizable under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c). His claims regarding his conviction and sentence had already been ruled on adversely to him in previous motions and appeals, the appellate court refused to consider them again. As a bond under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 20-1-201 (2004) was discretionary, and defendant failed to establish that the deputy district attorney who prosecuted him was required to file a bond, the appellate court rejected his contention that the prior court had no jurisdiction to prosecute him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the corporation contended the excise tax imposed by Colorado on the sale, use, consumption, handling, or distribution of certain tobacco products in the state under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-28.5-102 (2004) violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. While the appellate court agreed with the corporation's assertions that the tax base would be higher the later in the distribution network the product was taxed, it disagreed with the corporation's conclusion that this fact rendered the tax unconstitutional. Under the third prong of the Complete Auto test, the OTP tax neither facially discriminated nor had the effect of discriminating against out-of-state competitors. Further, the OTP tax scheme did not pressure out-of-state businesses to move to Colorado. Out-of-state manufacturers or distributors could engage in commerce within Colorado without suffering any burden from which local distributors or manufacturers are exempted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court's consideration of evidence regarding the character of the deceased victim violated defendant's Sixth Amendment confrontation right and rendered the sentencing proceedings fundamentally unfair in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. Finding no authority that either recognized a constitutional right of confrontation in sentencing proceedings or treated receipt of victim character evidence as a due process violation, the court rejected defendant's constitutional arguments. Because defendant's sentence did not exceed the cap in his plea bargain, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-409(1) (2004) precluded review of defendant's nonconstitutional challenges. The restitution order properly included a payment to the deceased victim's parents for burial expenses and travel costs to attend a memorial service and court appearances; defendant's conduct was the proximate cause of the parents' attendance at the memorial service, and the trial court did not err in refusing to reduce restitution by the insurance settlement paid to the parents by defendant's insurer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, prison reform coalition and individuals, appealed from a judgment of the City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado) that was entered in favor of defendants, executive director of the Corrections Department, the governor, the State, and members of the Board of Regents of Colorado University, in plaintiffs' declaratory action challenging the constitutionality of H.B. 1256, Gen. Assem. (Colo. 2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed H.B. 1256 violated the single subject requirement of Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 21 because funding for a prison and for academic facilities constituted two separate subjects. Plaintiffs also claimed it violated the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR), Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20(4)(b), which required voter approval in advance for the creation of any multiple-fiscal year debt or other financial obligation by the State. The court held that H.B. 1256 did not violate the single subject rule because it contained only one subject, which was the use of lease-purchase agreements to fund capital construction of certain state facilities, and the fact that it authorized two specific agreements for the construction of two projects did not convert the single subject into two disconnected and incongruous matters. The court held that H.B. 1256 did not violate the TABOR because it did not create multiple-year debt or other financial obligations, thus it was not subject to voter approval. The court concluded that the lease-purchase agreements did not pledge the credit of the State nor require the borrowing of funds. Also the trial court did not err in granting judgment on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was born in May 1992; his father died just before he turned two and his mother died just before he turned 5. The parents currently appealed from the trial court's order reinstating visitation rights to the grandparents and the court vacated the order on appeal, stating that it was not persuaded by the grandparents' assertion that adoptive parents' wishes were not entitled to as much weight as those of natural parents. Because the court discerned no statutory basis pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-5-211(1) (2004) for differentiating between the rights of natural and adoptive parents in the area, it concluded that, in a dispute over grandparent visitation, the wishes of adoptive parents were entitled to the same consideration as those of natural parents. The magistrate was not free to disregard the parents' wishes simply because it would have been in the child's best interests to do so. The magistrate had to find either that the parents were unfit or that their decisions to regulate visitation would have substantially endangered the emotional health of the child. The magistrate found neither, nor would the record have supported such a finding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant sought review of a final order of the Industrial Claim Appeals Office of the State of Colorado (the panel), which found that claimant's unemployment benefits were properly reduced pursuant to Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant suffered complications of diabetes and had been receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits for a number of years. After the claimant was laid off from a part-time job, he sought and received unemployment. The Division of Employment later learned that the claimant was receiving SSDI benefits and it determined that, because of the offset, the claimant could not be paid unemployment benefits pursuant to &sect; 8-73-110(3)(a)(I)(A). On appeal, the court found that the panel properly ruled that &sect; 8-73-110(3)(a)(I)(A) required that the claimant's unemployment benefits be reduced by half of the prorated weekly amount of his SSDI benefits, resulting in his ineligibility to receive any unemployment benefits. The court found no violation of the nondiscrimination provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act by the application of the statutory offset requirements and rejected the claimant's arguments that &sect; 8-73-110(3)(a)(I)(A) was otherwise unconstitutional. Finally, the court noted that the issue of whether the claimant was overpaid was not adjudicated in the administrative proceedings and was thus not properly before the court on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee citizen was arrested for failing to appear in another state. After being released when he posted a cash bond, the citizen filed a complaint arguing that appellant county court exceeded its jurisdiction by setting bail in the form of a &quot;cash only&quot; bond. The charges were later dismissed and the bond refunded. The Boulder County District Court, Colorado, found that the &quot;cash only&quot; bond was not authorized. The county court appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the undisputed facts showed that a ruling by the instant court would have had no practical legal effect on the citizen, the instant court determined that the question of whether the county court could impose a &quot;cash only&quot; bond on a defendant pending extradition prior to service of a governor's warrant merited resolution here. As Colorado had adopted the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-19-101 et seq., (2004), the instant court determined that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-19-117 (2004), which expressly applied to the setting of bail pending extradition. After reviewing case law in several jurisdictions, the instant court concluded that in reference to bail, the term &quot;sureties&quot; referred to a broad range of guarantees used for the purpose of securing the appearance of the defendant. Such guarantees included, but were not limited to, bonds secured by cash. Therefore, prior to service of a governor's warrant, a trial court was authorized to require bond for a defendant pending extradition in any type necessary to secure his or her appearance. Accordingly, the county court was within its jurisdiction to impose a &quot;cash only&quot; bond.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-402(1)(a), (4)(a) (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sexual assault conviction, contending that the trial court erred in limiting his cross-examination of the victim by excluding under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-407 (2004), the rape shield statute, an inquiry into whether she was in a &quot;committed romantic relationship&quot; with a roommate at the time of the alleged assault. The purpose of the inquiry was to establish that the victim had a motive to lie concerning whether the sex was consensual. The court agreed and reversed and remanded for a new trial. The statute would not have been violated had defendant been allowed to inquire into the victim's prior inconsistent statements acknowledging a committed romantic relationship. The victim would not have been subjected to a fishing expedition into her past sexual conduct. Rather, the inquiry would have called into question her credibility and her possible motive in telling her roommates that she had been sexually assaulted. Such an inquiry was proper under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-10-201 (2004) and Colo. R. Evid. 607 and 613. The court was also unable to conclude that the trial court's error did not contribute to the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer challenged a decision from the Jefferson County District Court (Colorado), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, several developers and a city, in a declaratory action seeking to determine the applicability of the city's charter amendment concerning the payment of incentives and subsidies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city established an economic incentive program that allowed for the reimbursement of local property taxes. Later, the city's charter was amended to require voter approval for development subsidies or incentives of $25,000. The taxpayer brought a declaratory action to determine the applicability of the charter amendment. After summary judgment was granted, the taxpayer sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the charter amendment was not unconstitutionally retrospective. The developers did not have a vested right under the incentive agreements. The agreements precluded the existence of financial obligations beyond one year. The city's implied duty of good faith and fair dealing did not create any vested rights either. Next, the court held that the retrospective application of the amendment would not have resulted in the creation of a new disability, duty, or obligation with respect to transactions already past. The developers only had a mere expectancy interest; therefore, there was no disability of constitutional magnitude. Since there were no vested rights, there was no violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 or Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether the charter amendment was intended to apply retroactively to the incentive agreements in the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado), which convicted defendant of attempted criminally negligent homicide, vehicular assault, theft from a person, forgery, and unauthorized use of a financial transaction device. Defendant also appealed the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove companions to a store where the companions took a fanny pack from a victim's grocery cart. The victim followed them out of the store and was injured by being thrown back as defendant sped away. The court held that even if the counts had been tried separately, evidence of the use of the stolen credit card would have been admissible to prove that defendant was involved. The court further held that the theft from the victim's shopping cart did not constitute an invasion of the victim's person pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-401(5). However, defendant's actions did constitute theft under &sect; 18-4-401(1). As to the vehicular assault, defendant justified her actions by indicating that a strange woman had grabbed her car, and so the record was replete with evidence that defendant's actions caused the victim's injuries. The trial court did not state where it obtained the facts on which it based the aggravated sentence, and the facts were not found by the jury to be aggravating. Therefore, the sentence violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. Finally, attempted criminally negligent homicide was not a cognizable offense in Colorado and had to be removed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of conviction for theft from a person and remanded for correction of the mittimus to remove the conviction for attempted criminally negligent homicide and for resentencing on the theft and vehicular assault convictions. The judgment and sentence were otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of criminal mischief and conspiracy to commit criminal mischief in the El Paso County District Court, Colorado. Defendant appealed, challenging his sentence for the conspiracy conviction. He asserted that his aggravated range sentence was unconstitutional because it was imposed based on a factual determination of extraordinary aggravating circumstances impermissibly made by the sentencing court, rather than by a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant also asserted the trial court erred by granting the prosecution's challenge for cause to a prospective juror. However, the prosecution did not use all its peremptory challenges. Thus, any possible error was harmless. The appellate court noted that pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-301(1)(b) (2004), the statutory framework under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(6) (2004) also governed the length of direct sentences to community corrections. Secondly, a defendant's prior criminal convictions could constitute an extraordinary aggravating circumstance within the meaning of &sect; 18-1.3-401(6). A Sixth Amendment violation occurred when the sentencing court found facts other than a prior conviction and aggravated a defendant's sentence based thereon. In the latter case, a defendant had a right to a jury trial, and such factors had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In the instant case, the trial court found defendant had committed a previous felony and numerous misdemeanors, &quot;facts&quot; that legitimately could be employed by a sentencing court in imposing a sentence without running afoul of the Sixth Amendment. Thus, defendant's sentence was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, sought review of the decision of the Adams County District Court (Colorado), which denied his post-conviction motion under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who ran away from his home in Illinois, was convicted on jury verdicts in two separate trials for kidnapping, robbery, burglary, and murder of an elderly woman. Following his arrest and after signing a form waiving his Miranda rights, he made incriminating statements to the police that were later admitted at trial.  The verdicts were affirmed on an earlier direct appeal and defendant's post-conviction motion was subsequently denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-511(2)(a)(III) (2004), did not confer a fundamental right. Section 19-2-511 did not diminish Fifth Amendment protections. Rather, it provided for additional protection. The provision did not abrogate Miranda's protections, but required that a runaway juvenile's statements were not admissible unless he made a valid waiver pursuant to &sect; 19-2-511(2)(a). His equal protection challenge failed to show that the disparate treatment bore no rational relationship to a legitimate legislative purpose or governmental objective. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2-511 (2005) was thus constitutional under a rational basis standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother contended that the trial court erred in determining that it lacked jurisdiction to grant grandparent visitation with respect to the two older children. The grandmother argued that she had standing to proceed under Colo. Rev.

The appellate court concluded that the plain language of &sect; 19-1-117 did not authorize the trial court to hear the grandmother's petition because there had been no judicial intervention into the marriage of the children's parents under &sect; 19-1-117(1)(a), judicial placement of the children outside their family under &sect; 19-1-117(1)(b), or death of the grandparent's child under &sect; 19-1-117(1)(c). The children were in the care and custody of their mother, the grandmother's daughter, and she was making determinations regarding the level of contact that the children had with her own family.

The inmate also alleged that a wait of 13 days to see the nurse for a headache violated his Eighth Amendment rights. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and the court affirmed. The court held that the inmate failed to establish an Eighth Amendment violation because the mere failure to provide aspirin for a headache for 13 days, without more, did not constitute deliberate indifference to medical needs. The co-payments were not unreasonable and they were authorized by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-1-113(2). The inmate failed to state any grounds for mandamus relief because he did not show that the amount of the co-payments at issue was unreasonable. The inmate had not shown that he had attempted to obtain a waiver of the co-payment from the DOC, or that he had been denied treatment because of his inability to make the co-payment. The inmate's claim that the co-payments impacted his ability to pay for postage for legal mail or service of other legal papers did not allege a claim for denial of access to the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a putative class action, plaintiff motorists appealed a judgment of the City and County of Denver District Court (Colorado) that dismissed with prejudice their claims against defendants, city, county, and ticket processing company, concerning fines and late fees assessed for parking violations. The motorists sought return of the late fees and declaratory and injunctive relief as to their rights under the Denver Municipal Revised Code (DMRC).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorists claimed that late fees on parking violations under Denver, Colo., Rev. Mun. Code. 54-829 violated the DMRC provisions that prohibited the collection of fees for ordinance violations unless specifically provided for in the DMRC. The trial court dismissed the motorists' claim based on unjust enrichment because immunity was not waived by the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-20-202 et seq. (2004), and recovery was precluded under the voluntary payment rule. The trial court dismissed their claims under the Federal and Colorado Fair Debt Collection Practices Acts, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1692 et seq. and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-14-101 et seq. (2004), and the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 6-1-101 et seq. (2004), concluding that parking ordinances did not give rise to a commercial transaction. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the motorists' claim for declaratory and injunctive relief because the requested relief addressed future conduct and was not barred under the voluntary payment rule and the motorists' allegations were sufficient to make them &quot;interested persons&quot; under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-51-106.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the judgment that dismissed the motorists' declaratory and injunctive relief claim and that awarded attorney fees to the ticket processing company and remanded the case for further consistent proceedings.

The court affirmed and held that under the vast weight of authority, the category of nonwaivable jurisdictional defects did not include statutory speedy trial violations. After the trial court denied his motions to dismiss premised on an alleged statutory speedy trial violation, defendant entered an unconditional guilty plea. He did not challenge the voluntariness of that plea either in the trial court or on appeal. At the providency hearing, the prosecutor specifically noted the understanding that, by pleading guilty, defendant would be forgoing any claim of violation of his speedy trial rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant entered a plea of guilty to an aggravated incest charge and negligent child abuse. The parties' agreement provided for a probated sentence on the aggravated incest count and a prison sentence for the negligent child abuse count that was not to exceed 25 years. Defendant did not expressly agree that there were aggravating circumstances on the incest count or that the trial court was authorized to consider the issue of their existence. The trial court imposed a sentence of 25 years, which fell within the aggravated sentencing range. The court concluded that Colo. Rev.

Section 18-1-409(1) did not prohibit an appeal if the issue raised was based on some irregularity or impropriety in the proceedings that led to the imposition of the sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was 17-years-old at the time, was convicted after arriving at a home with a gun and wearing a mask. On appeal, the court affirmed his convictions and sentence, stating that his consent was invalid. Thus, the trial court did not err in failing to grant his motion to suppress the results of blood, saliva, and hair samples taken from him. While defendant was in custody, he and his mother twice consented to the search and seizure of his blood, saliva, and hair samples. While still at defendant's home, the deputies discussed with defendant's mother, in his presence, the possibility of doing some forensic testing. Defendant spontaneously interjected that he did not commit the crimes and wanted to take a blood test to prove it. Further, the trial court did not err in qualifying the prosecution's DNA expert pursuant to Colo. R. Evid. 702, as the expert had extensive experience in serology before he began performing DNA analysis and he had specialized education, experience, and training in DNA testing. Consecutive sentences were appropriate, as the sentencing court was required to abide by the statutes that increased his sentence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that Colo. Rev.

The appellate court held that, pursuant to Colo. Rev.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(E) or Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant board of county commissioners challenged a decision from the Elbert County District Court (Colorado), which entered partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff owners in a dispute over rezoning regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners had a large tract of land, which they divided into separate parcels. Each of the four parcels had more than 35 acres. Thereafter, they were informed that any building permit would be denied until they received approval for the appropriate land use application. The owners then filed a declaratory action seeking a judgment that the rezoning regulations were illegal and unenforceable under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-28-101(10)(b). The trial court granted the owners' motion, and the board appealed. In reversing, the court determined that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-28-133 (2004) only authorized subdivision regulations controlled parcels of land smaller than 35 acres. However, this exemption did not preclude the board from requiring them to rezone their parcels that were larger than 35 acres. The exemption did not limit a county's power to enact zoning regulations based on lot size, pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 30-28-111(1) (2004). The county was not prohibited from imposing reasonable fees in connection with rezoning. Finally, the court was unable to determine from the sparse record whether any of the overlapping rezoning requirements reasonably furthered lawful zoning objectives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant argued that the court erred in omitting the &quot;extended limits&quot; language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-27.5-104 (2004) from the jury instruction that set forth the elements of escape. The appellate court disagreed. The court defined &quot;custody and confinement,&quot; as used in the escape statute, as including the status of an individual who was on ISP from the department of corrections. The instructions as a whole instructed the jury on the crime of escape from ISP. The elements instruction essentially tracked the pattern instruction. Further, the court's definition of custody and confinement informed the jury that ISP constituted custody and confinement. Defendant contended that the trial court violated his right to present a defense by excluding his sister's testimony that he lived with her. The appellate court disagreed. As a condition of ISP, defendant signed a parole agreement that he had to establish a residence of record and would reside there and not change his residence without the consent of his parole officer. The trial court found that evidence was irrelevant to the escape charge, because the escape occurred when defendant left his residence of record.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 6-1-113. The builder sold luxury homes with radiant heating systems containing rubber hoses that were defective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the rubber company claimed the homeowners' claims for punitive and treble damages under the CCPA were not assignable and that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of prior complaints about the hoses. The court held that the invited error doctrine precluded the company from asserting that the homeowners' claims were not assignable, as the company moved for the complete substitution of the builder as the real party in interest under Colo. R. Civ. P. 25(c) and asserted that all interests were transferred. The court held that the admission of evidence regarding prior complaints about defects in the hoses was not grounds for reversal, because the evidence was admitted to show the company had notice, not to show the defective nature of the hoses, and did not result in unfair prejudice. The court held that notice was relevant, because, to recover punitive damages under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-21-102(1)(a) (2004), the builder needed to prove the company acted willfully. The court rejected the company's equal protection and procedural and substantive due process claims and held that the protection of the public was a rational basis for treble damages under the CCPA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State was required to refund excess revenue under the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR), Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 20. To comply with TABOR, and to avoid federal income tax implications for recipients, the Colorado General Assembly decided to refund a portion of sales tax collected to full-year residents. The State enacted Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-22-120 (2004) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 39-22-2001 to 39-22-2003 (2004) to accomplish these objectives. The Colorado General Assembly concluded that proportional refunds were not feasible. The taxpayers claimed that the tax refunds violated U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2. The appellate court disagreed. The relevant inquiry was who paid the most taxes overall, not who paid the most sales tax. The general assembly determined that full-year residents paid most of the taxes. The distinctions were justified. Further, the taxpayers made no specific allegation as to how their right to travel was hindered. Applying a rational basis test, the appellate court also rejected the taxpayers' equal protection argument. Finally, the taxpayers did not establish that the refund statutes have anything more than an incidental burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c) motion in the El Paso County District Court, Colorado, asserting various grounds upon which to set aside either an additional period of supervision or a sex offender condition of his release from prison. The trial court denied the motion, but subsequently entered an order effectively staying the parole board's supervision of defendant's release. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty to felony menacing, defendant was sentenced to two years in prison and two years of mandatory parole. Defendant's parole was later revoked and he was reincarcerated for the remainder of his parole period. Near the end of his reincarceration period, defendant was told that he would be required to complete an additional one-year period of post-release supervision. Defendant argued that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-22.5-403(9) (a)-(f) was unconstitutional, that he should not have been subject to additional supervision, as he was not advised as such when he entered his plea, and that his sex offender treatment as a condition of supervised release was error. The appellate court noted that defendant's first argument was not preserved for appellate review. The appellate court held that the possibility that a defendant could be subjected to post-release supervision was not a direct consequence of a guilty plea, and thus, the trial court was not obliged to advise defendant of it at the providency hearing. The appellate court concluded that the Colorado Department of Correction's sex offender classification did not fall within the purview of Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c)(2).</SPAN></P>

The trial court adjudicated defendant a habitual criminal based on his prior convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the second phase of defendant's criminal trial for robbery and theft, the trial court adjudicated defendant a habitual criminal based on prior convictions for unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, attempted possession of a controlled substance, eluding a pursuing police vehicle, and robbery. Pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 181.3801(2) (2003), the trial court sentenced defendant to 24 years in custody, four times the maximum presumptive range sentence for robbery. The trial court found that the sentence was not disproportionate. On appeal, defendant contended that the convictions underlying the habitual offender charges were not grave and serious offenses. The appellate court disagreed. Defendant's triggering robbery conviction and his prior convictions for robbery and attempted possession of a controlled substance were all grave and serious offenses. Defendant's out-of-state conviction for eluding a pursuing police vehicle and defendant's federal conviction for possession of a gun by a convicted felon were also grave and serious offenses.</SPAN></P>
