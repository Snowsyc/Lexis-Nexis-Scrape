</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State charged defendant with violating Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 509(1), unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, and Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 319(1), failure to provide proof of valid insurance. The trial court then asked the State and defendant to prepare memos on the disposition of those charges and the sentence that the trial court might impose, if any.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State charged defendant with violations of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 509(1), unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, and Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 319(1), failure to provide proof of valid insurance. The trial court presumed that defendant was in the United States illegally. It then found that Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 509(1) was defined by Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 502, the requirements for licensing. It further found that Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 502(1) provided that an applicant had to furnish such proof of identity as the state motor vehicles department commissioner required. However, it also noted that the department's point system made it mathematically impossible for an illegal immigrant to prove identity. The trial court then found Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 502 and Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 509(1) violated the state and federal Constitutions' Equal Protection Clauses, and the state and federal constitutions' Privileges and Immunities Clauses, because national security interests were not furthered by them and not being able to get driver's licenses would keep some residents from earning a living. It also found that Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 319(1) had no such problems.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court dismissed the charge against defendant of unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. It found that the charge against defendant of failure to provide proof of insurance remained intact and adjourned a hearing on that charge to give defendant and the State time to consider the trial court's decision and any plea arrangements that could arise from that decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Proof of Identity Requirements for Obtaining Driver's License -- Undocumented Aliens </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 509 (1), which proscribes the unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, and Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 502 (1), which requires an applicant for a driver's license to &quot;furnish such proof of identity . . . as may be required&quot; by the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles, were unconstitutional as applied to defendant, an undocumented alien who was precluded from obtaining a driver's license in New York by virtue of being unable to provide the proof of identity documents required for licensing under the system adopted by the Commissioner in compliance with the Real ID Act of 2005 (Pub L 109-13 division B, 119 US Stat 302, 312). Undocumented aliens are deemed to be &quot;persons&quot; for due process and equal protection purposes. New York's otherwise facially-neutral licensing system is violative of equal protection as applied under a strict scrutiny analysis to the extent that it makes it impossible for undocumented aliens to prove their identities and thus obtain driver's licenses. It could not be demonstrated that precluding undocumented aliens from obtaining driver's licenses constituted a necessary means for achieving the state's legitimate national security concerns. Furthermore, New York's driver's licensing scheme violates the Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the federal and state constitutions (US Const, art IV, &sect; 2; NY Const, art I, &sect; 1) by discriminating against undocumented aliens with regard to privileges and immunities accorded to New York citizens. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On remand from the Court of Appeals (New York), the court was to consider whether constitutional claims by petitioners, family members and/or friend of inmates and nonprofit organizations that provided legal services to state inmates, regarding the charges for collect telephone calls from the inmates should be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action pursuant to CPLR 3211.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The action was brought against respondents, the state department of correctional services (DOCS) and a telephone communications provider. The DOCS and the provider had instituted a collect call system with the DOCS to receive a 57.5% commission. On remand, the court dismissed the petition. While petitioners claimed that the commission to the DOCS was an unlawful tax under N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 and art. XVI, &sect; 1, the Public Service Commission's failure to fulfill its statutory responsibilities under Public Service Law &sect;&sect; 92 and 97 by declining to review the DOCS commission did not operate to transmute what was a tariff into a tax. Equal protection under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 was not violated because recipients of inmate calls could not be deemed to be similarly situated to the members of the public at large. Petitioners' rights to free speech and association under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 were not violated because limited telephone access by inmates had been found not to rise to the level of a constitutional violation and the rights of non-inmates to communicate with inmates had to fall within the contours of the rights possessed by the inmates themselves.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted respondents' motion to dismiss and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- State Constitutional Law -- Constitutionality of Single-Provider Collect Call System for Prison Inmates </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioners failed to demonstrate in a combined declaratory judgment/CPLR article 78 proceeding that the single-provider inmate collect call telephone system implemented by respondent Department of Correctional Services violated any constitutional rights of state prison inmates and their families. Petitioners failed to demonstrate that respondent imposed an unconstitutional tax upon them (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art XVI, &sect; 1) through the collection of a 57.5% commission from the telephone service provider. Since the Public Service Commission (PSC) possessed full authority to review the proposed rates to be paid to the service provider, including respondent's commission (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Service Law &sect; 97), the portion of the PSC-approved tariff attributable to the commission did not constitute a tax. The fact that the PSC declined to review the reasonableness of respondent's commission did not operate to transform the commission into a tax. Furthermore, respondent's inmate telephone system did not unconstitutionally infringe upon petitioners' substantive due process rights or petitioners' rights to freedom of speech or association. In addition, the mere fact that inmate families and friends paid comparatively more for telephone calls than the general public did not result in an unconstitutional taking for which just compensation had to be paid or violate petitioners' rights to equal protection. The recipients of inmate calls cannot be deemed to be similarly situated to members of the public at large. </SPAN></P>

Const. art. VI, &sect; 25(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found, inter alia, that inasmuch as Judiciary Law &sect;&sect; 221 through 221-I were not amended, no increase in judicial compensation could be effected despite the appropriation of funds for that purpose. The governmental officials were entitled to immunity under N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 11.

Const. art. VI, &sect; 25(a) based on a failure to maintain judicial salaries apace with inflation due. Because the alleged linkage between increases in legislative and judicial salaries did not create a suspect classification, or involve a fundamental right, the Equal Protection Clause was not violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant moved for a declaration that Penal Law &sect; 265.01(1) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad as applied to his conduct in allegedly possessing a gravity knife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">According to defendant, Penal Law &sect; 265.01(1) was constitutionally defective because he could be convicted of violating it even though he did not know that the knife in his possession was a gravity knife. The court found, inter alia, that &sect; 265.01(1) provided clear notice as to the specific characteristics that defined an illegal gravity knife. Furthermore, there was a rational connection between the regulation of dangerous knives and public safety. The police officer's action in recognizing the unique handle of a gravity knife jutting out of defendant's pocket was not arbitrary. There was no evidence in the record to support defendant's claim that he did not know his knife was a gravity knife. Consequently, the court declined to declare &sect; 265.01(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional based on unsworn allegations regarding defendant's knowledge or ability to operate the gravity knife.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1), which criminalizes possession of any of a number of listed weapons, including a gravity knife, without proof that the defendant knew that the weapon he or she possessed fit the statutory definition, was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant, who was found in possession of a gravity knife near the entrance of a public school while students were leaving. The legislature has the power to declare possession of weapons seldom used for justifiable purposes unlawful without proof of criminal intent, provided there is a reasonable relationship between the public safety, health or welfare and the act prohibited. A gravity knife, which is specifically defined in Penal Law &sect; 265.00 (5) as any knife having &quot;a blade which is released from the handle or sheath thereof by the force of gravity or the application of centrifugal force which, when released, is locked in place by means of a button, spring, lever or other device,&quot; can seldom be used for legitimate purposes and is clearly used unlawfully as a weapon. Moreover, conviction under the statute requires the People to prove that a defendant knew he or she possessed a knife, and that the knife was an operable gravity knife containing a locking mechanism that does not require any effort by the user. Thus, the statute provided defendant with adequate notice and the police with clear criteria as to the characteristics that distinguish a gravity knife from other types of knives. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer, individually and in his capacity as a town supervisor, brought an action against defendant State, and others, challenging the constitutionality of various New York statutes relating to the State's payment of real property taxes. Following an earlier appeal and remand, the taxpayer filed an amended complaint alleging a violation of State Finance Law &sect; 123-D(1). The parties moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State claimed that the taxpayer lacked standing or capacity to sue. The court held, however, that State Finance Law &sect; 123-B did not require an individual bringing the action to be affected or specifically aggrieved by the activity at issue. Also, the interests of those municipalities which might have been inequitably affected by a judgment were adequately represented by the State. Thus, the State's claim that the taxpayer failed to join indispensable parties was meritless. The taxpayer argued that the State's disbursement of funds by making tax payments to municipalities whose jurisdictions included State-owned land, while not also making tax payments to other similarly situated municipalities was unconstitutional. The court agreed. The granting of taxing authority to include State-owned land in certain communities, while continuing the exemption for State-owned land with the same characteristics or the same use to other communities divorced the rational relationship from any legitimate State purpose. The distinction made between State-owned land where taxation was allowed and land which was tax-exempt was arbitrary and had no rational relationship to any state purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer's summary judgment motion was granted. The court entered judgment declaring that the State's disbursement of funds at issue was unconstitutional and permanently enjoining the State from paying taxes and/or payments in lieu of taxes at issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a citizen-taxpayer action pursuant to State Finance Law &sect; 123-b brought by plaintiff Town Supervisor in his individual capacity, defendants were permanently enjoined from disbursing state funds to municipalities under the State's taxation system with regard to otherwise tax-exempt state-owned lands. The existing haphazard taxation system is unconstitutional as violative of equal protection by permitting taxation of state-owned lands and providing payments in lieu of real property taxes for some municipalities but not for other similarly situated municipalities. The disparity in taxes imposed upon state-owned lands located within some municipalities but not on state-owned lands located in others (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;RPTL 532, 534, 536; ECL 15-2115) is arbitrary and bears no rational relationship to any legitimate state purpose, resulting in invidious discrimination. While the State Constitution does not prohibit dual rates or require that all taxpayers be treated the same, it does require that those similarly situated be treated uniformly. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant made a motion to dismiss a complaint charging him with criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree under Penal Law &sect; 265.01. Defendants also moved for dismissal of the accusatory instrument for facial insufficiency pursuant to CPL 170.30(1)(a), 170.35(1)(a)-(b), 100.15, and 100.40; to controvert the warrant under CPL art. 690; and to reserve the right to make additional motions pursuant to CPL 255.20(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought to dismiss the complaint against him, alleging that &sect; 265.01 was unconstitutional under the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. Upon consideration, the court denied defendant's motions except that to reserve his rights to make further motions. Reviewing the existing precedent, the court held that any right under the Second Amendment was not applicable to the states and that the Second Amendment did not protect an individual and personal right to bear arms but only the collective right to bear arms within the context of a well-regulated militia. The accusatory instrument was not facially insufficient under CPL 100.40(4)(b) because the State was not required to allege that defendant was not licensed to possess the weapon; because the exemptions in Penal Law &sect; 265.20 from criminal liability for weapons possession were separate from Penal Law &sect; 265.01, those exemptions were defenses to be raised at trial. The search warrant was not invalid because the fact that a confidential informant observed a weapon in defendant's home shortly before the search warrant application was not a sufficient delay to render the evidence stale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied defendant's motions in their entirety with the exception that defendant's motion to reserve his rights to make further motions was granted to the extent provided for by CPL 255.20(3).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right to Bear Arms -- Validity of Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1), which imposes liability for the possession of &quot;any firearm,&quot; does not violate the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Second Amendment has never been found applicable to the states, either directly or through the Fourteenth Amendment, and provides no bar to state regulation such as Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1). Even if it were made applicable to the states, it does not confer an individual right to bear arms that would invalidate Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1). The Second Amendment's right to bear arms is not an individual right but a collective right, attaching only to state militias.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Possession of Weapon -- Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1) Not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unconstitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> as Applied to Defendant </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1), which imposes liability for the possession of &quot;any firearm,&quot; was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant, a 19-year-old suspected gang member who was arrested and charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree after police executing a search warrant discovered a loaded .44 caliber Magnum revolver in his apartment located in a large public housing property. The Second Amendment does not confer an individual right to bear arms, and does not affect state legislation. The Penal Law restriction prohibiting possession of firearms by defendant, a teenaged suspected gang member who asserted no purpose for wanting to possess a firearm, was reasonable.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Possession of Weapon -- Facial Sufficiency of Complaint </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The complaint charging defendant with criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree in violation of Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1) was facially sufficient even though it did not allege that defendant was not licensed to possess the loaded .44 caliber Magnum revolver found in his apartment. Although Penal Law &sect; 265.20 (a) (3) exempts those licensed to possess a pistol or revolver from criminal liability under the statutes criminalizing weapons possession, that exemption is contained separately from the statute under which defendant was charged, and was a defense to be raised at trial. There are 23 exemptions concerning firearms listed in Penal Law &sect; 265.20, and requiring the People to disprove them in every case brought under Penal Law &sect; 265.01 (1) would defy common sense and reasonable pleading. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner nominee filed an application to order respondent New York State Board of Elections to certify his name to appear among the candidates for the Right to Life Party in the 2007 General Election, and to enjoin, restrain, to prohibit respondent county election boards from distributing the official ballots without his name, and to declare Election Law &sect; 7-104&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The nominee was a candidate for re-election to the public office of justice of a supreme court. The State Board of Elections did not provide the nominee a separate, fourth voting position on the ballot. The nominee alleged that the Board was forcing the emblem for the Right to Life Party to be placed on the Conservative party line and leaving the ballot position for the Right to Life Party blank. The court found that a side-by-side comparison of the two ballot layouts showed that the only candidate being affected was the nominee and that the Board's ballot layout made it appear that the nominee was running against the candidates of the Right to Life Party rather than with them. Since a separate line was reserved on the ballot for the justice candidates by the Right to Life Party, it would be unfair to the nominee, his running mates, and the voters to have a blank space where the nominee's name would otherwise appear. The court could not condone a remorseless reading of &sect; 7-104, and the absurd result it would produce. Therefore, it was unconstitutional as applied to the nominee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The application was granted, the State Board was ordered to place the nominee's name on the ballots, the county boards were ordered to print and distribute ballots with his name on them, and &sect; 7-104 was declared unconstitutional as applied to the nominee; all other requested relief was denied.</SPAN></P>

Respondents' ballot layout made it appear that petitioner was running against the candidates of the Right to Life Party rather than with them. Although respondents were literally following Election Law &sect; 7-104 when they excluded petitioner from the row, to do so was discriminatory and unconstitutional, both as to petitioner and as to the voters allied with the independent movement that wished to support the candidates only on the independent line. As the independent body's line already existed, the leaving of a blank space where the name of petitioner would otherwise appear would be nonsensical. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant had an I.Q. of less than 60. The defense argued that because defendant had a permanent mental or physical disability that kept him from ever engaging in income-producing activity, the court should not assess the various fees outlined in Penal Law &sect; 60.35. The court found that the legislature overlooked persons too disabled to engage in gainful employment when it amended CPL 420.35(2) to no longer allow a waiver of Penal Law &sect; 60.35 fees. The allowance of a deferral in payment of such assessments did not deal with the fact certain permanent disabled individuals would never be able to earn income from which to pay such assessments at the time of sentence or in the future. Defendant was thereby deprived of his 60 days of opportunity to earn the money, and thereby avoid jail or the consequences of a civil judgment. The court found that in such cases Penal Law &sect; 60.35 was an unconstitutional violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court found that defendant was entitled to a hearing to determine if his disabilities permanently barred him from engaging in income-producing activity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was granted a hearing prior to sentencing on his conviction of attempted forcible touching (Penal Law &sect; 130.52) to determine whether his mental and/or physical disabilities would prevent him from ever engaging in income-producing activity from which to pay the mandatory fees upon sentencing or within 60 days thereafter (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 60.35), notwithstanding the explicit statutory prohibition against any waiver of those mandatory fees (CPL 420.35). The Legislature, in amending the statutory scheme in 1995 to prohibit a court from waiving the mandatory fees, merely overlooked indigent persons too disabled to engage in gainful employment who would have previously been granted a waiver. In any event, application of the statutory prohibition would violate due process by denying permanently disabled persons with no income-producing capacity the benefit available to nondisabled persons who are able to pay the mandatory fees within 60 days of sentence and thus avoid the consequences of nonpayment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted in Vermont of lewd and lascivious conduct under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2601 and was required to register as a sex offender there. After defendant established his residence in New York, the New York board of examiners of sex offenders determined that defendant was required to register as a sex offender in New York. Upon consideration, the court denied defendant's motion. While the court had no jurisdiction to determine whether defendant was required to register as a sex offender in New York, the board was authorized to do so under Correction Law &sect; 168-k(2); a CPLR art. 78 proceeding was the appropriate means to obtain a review of the board's decision. Because defendant was convicted of a felony in another jurisdiction for which he was required to register as a sex offender in that jurisdiction, Correction Law &sect; 168-a(2)(d)(ii) applied, and no comparison of the elements of the foreign crime and a New York sex offense were required under Correction Law &sect; 168-a(2)(d)(i). Thus, the court did not have jurisdiction to review the board's determination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Sex Offender Registration Act -- Registration by Sex Offenders Convicted in Other Jurisdictions -- Judicial Review of Registration Determination</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction in a Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) proceeding to review the determination of the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders requiring defendant to register as a sex offender in New York by virtue of his felony conviction in Vermont of lewd and lascivious conduct for which he was required to register as a sex offender in that state (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Correction Law &sect;168-a [2] [d] [ii]). Under the statutory scheme, the Board was empowered to make that initial determination. The role of the hearing court is limited to assigning defendant a risk level classification and determining whether he is a sexual predator. There was no need for the court to determine whether the Vermont statute was equivalent to a comparable New York registerable sex offense. SORA expressly required that defendant be classified as a sex offender because of his conviction of a registerable felony in Vermont.   </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Sex Offender Registration Act -- Registration by Sex Offenders Convicted in Other Jurisdictions -- Statutory Scheme Not Violative of Equal Protection</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The provision of the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) that required defendant to register as a sex offender in New York when he established residency in New York by virtue of his prior felony conviction in Vermont of lewd and lascivious conduct for which he was required to register as a sex offender in that state (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Correction Law &sect; 168-a [2] [d] [ii]) was not violative of equal protection. The challenged SORA provision does not discriminate between out-of-state and New York residents. Rather, a Vermont resident and New York resident would be treated no differently under SORA. A Vermont resident who moved to New York after being convicted of a registerable felony in Vermont would be treated the same as a New York resident convicted of a registerable felony in Vermont. Since defendant would have been required to register in New York had he been a continuing resident of New York when he was convicted of the Vermont felony, he was not discriminated against based upon his state of residency. Furthermore, the challenged provision did not in any way unconstitutionally impede defendant's right to travel. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An unwed father filed two motions objecting to petitioner foster care agency's application to terminate his parental rights (TPR); the father claimed, inter alia, that Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111(1)(d), which set out the requirements for an unwed father to have veto rights over his child's adoption, was constitutionally infirm because it denied him equal protection and due process based on distinctions by gender and marital status.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the child was born, she was placed with foster parents. The biological parents were warned and notified that if the child remained in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months, the foster care agency might be required to file a TPR petition. The father did not maintain regular contact with the foster care agency or the child during his imprisonment. Following his release, the father tested positive again for opiates. The appellate court found that the child would be prejudiced if the father's motion to hold the TPR in abeyance were granted, since she had been in foster care for three years and deserved permanency. The father did not meet the requisite statutory requirements in Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111(1)(d) to be determined to be a father whose consent was required for the child's adoption. Despite the fact that the father publicly acknowledged his paternity, his actions did not rise to the level of a consent father. The statutory distinction between married and unwed fathers did not violate the father's due process or equal protection rights because it was based on the father-child relationship rather than the gender or marital status of the father.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The proceeding to terminate respondent mother's parental rights to her three-year-old daughter, who had been in foster care since birth, did not have to be held in abeyance pending the conclusion of, and appeals from, the permanency hearing, and pending the court changing the permanency goal from &quot;return to parents&quot; to &quot;free for adoption.&quot; The child would be prejudiced if the court granted the motion to hold the termination proceeding in abeyance made by her father, who had never been married to respondent mother and had been placed on notice of the termination proceeding, as the child had been in foster care for three years and deserved permanency. The father, on the other hand, was not prejudiced, as petitioner agency would still be required to prove the termination cause of action by clear and convincing evidence, and then, at disposition, prove that it served the best interest of the child to be freed, all of which would be appealable. Moreover, to hold the termination proceeding in abeyance would be contrary to the intent of the state and federal permanency laws.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Collateral Estoppel -- Effect of Prior Permanency Hearing Order on Termination of Parental Rights Proceeding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A permanency hearing order stating that the goal for the child, who had been in foster care since birth, was &quot;return to parents&quot; did not collaterally estop petitioner agency from filing, eight months later, a petition to terminate respondent mother's parental rights with notice to the child's father. Pursuant to Family Court Act &sect; 1089 (a) (3), a permanency hearing must be held every six months. If a termination of parental rights petition is filed more than six months after a permanency hearing order was issued, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply, as there no longer is an identity of issues and the party against whom collateral estoppel is sought did not have a full and fair opportunity to be heard.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Unwed Father </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a proceeding to terminate the parental rights of respondent mother and free for adoption her three-year-old child, who had been in foster care since birth, Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (d) was the applicable statute for determining whether the consent of the child's father, who was never married to the child's mother, was required. Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (d) is applicable when a child born out of wedlock is &quot;placed with the adoptive parents more than six months after birth,&quot; while Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (e) applies when a child born out of wedlock is &quot;placed for adoption&quot; under the &quot;age of six months.&quot; Here, the child was remanded into foster care when she was less than six months old, but her foster care placement, at that point, was temporary and not the equivalent of being placed for adoption.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Unwed Father </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a proceeding to terminate the parental rights of respondent mother and free for adoption her three-year-old child, who had been in foster care since birth, the consent of the child's father, who was never married to the mother, was not required in order for her to be adopted. Under Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (d), the consent of the father of a child born out of wedlock and &quot;placed with the adoptive parents more than six months after birth&quot; is required in order for the child to be adopted only if the father had maintained substantial and continuous contact with the child as manifested by both financial support and visitation at least monthly with the child, or regular communication with the child's custodian if visitation was not possible. Here, the child's father conceded that he did not provide any financial support for her at any time despite the fact that he was employed both before and after his incarceration, and the occasional gifts he did buy for her did not rise to the level of a fair and reasonable sum based on his means. The fact that she was in foster care did not excuse him from providing financial support, as he still had an obligation to offer assistance or inquire of the agency about his financial responsibility. Moreover, while the father did maintain some visitation with her prior to, and after, his incarceration, that minimal visitation alone was not sufficient to establish his consent status. Although he was unable to visit with her during the 20 months he was incarcerated, he failed to maintain contact with either the child or the agency during his incarceration.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Unwed Father -- Constitutionality of Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (d)--Due Process </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a proceeding to terminate the parental rights of respondent mother and free for adoption her three-year-old child, who had been in foster care since birth, Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (d), which sets forth the criteria necessary for an unwed father's consent to be required for the adoption of his child, did not violate the due process rights of the child's father by denying him a right to veto the adoption. The father did not maintain substantial and continuous contact with the child as required by the statute, and therefore did not have a fundamental liberty interest that was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause. Although a natural parent has a liberty interest in the care and custody of his or her child, that liberty interest may be limited where, as here, an unwed father does not establish a significant and substantial relationship with his child.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Consent -- Unwed Father -- Constitutionality of Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (d)--Equal Protection </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a proceeding to terminate the parental rights of respondent mother and free for adoption her three-year-old child, who had been in foster care since birth, Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (d), which sets forth the criteria necessary for an unwed father's consent to be required for the adoption of his child, did not violate the equal protection rights of the child's father by denying him a right to veto the adoption. The father did not maintain substantial and continuous contact with the child as required by the statute. Nor is the statute, which sets out requirements for unwed fathers to establish a right to veto an adoption while not requiring such a showing for married fathers or any mothers, unconstitutional on its face. Statutes that draw gender-based distinctions must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives in order to withstand judicial scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. Here, the statute's requirement that unwed fathers demonstrate substantial and continuous contact with their child substantially relates to the government's interest of ensuring the welfare of a child born out of wedlock.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, a church and a district, initiated a proceeding against respondents, a village, the village board of trustees, a village code enforcement officer, and a village community development corporation, for declaratory and other relief under CPLR art. 78 regarding the board's determination to deny petitioners' request for a special use permit to locate a church in an industrial park.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board properly denied the church's request because, after balancing a church's presumed beneficial effects against industrial uses in the industrial park, it found it was in the over-all public interest to deny the request based on the following legitimate interests impacting the public welfare: (1) creating an industrial park to advance economic development; (2) use of public investment and development of the industrial park for industrial uses, including economic development through job creation, property taxes and related economic activities; and (3) use of the industrial park consistent with a comprehensive plan. Economic development was a legitimate consideration to balance against the church's presumed beneficial impact. There was a substantial relationship between the denial of the request for a special permit and legitimate considerations limiting use of the industrial park to industrial and related uses to advance economic development and compliance with a comprehensive plan. Village of Lancaster, N.Y., Code &sect; 152-26, addressing industrial park zoning, was, on its face and as applied, unconstitutional as applied to a church without using a balancing approach.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The determination of respondent Village Board denying petitioner's application for a special use permit to construct a church on commercial property located in a municipally created industrial park restricted to industrial and related uses was upheld as having a rational basis and being supported by substantial evidence (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 7803 [3]). In assessing a special use permit application to expand a religious use into such a municipally zoned area, zoning officials are required to utilize a balancing approach that weighs the presumed beneficial effects of the religious use against the municipality's &quot;other legitimate competing interests,&quot; with primary consideration being given to the overall impact on the public welfare. Here, although construction of a church would not have adverse effects on traditional police power concerns such as traffic congestion, respondent otherwise demonstrated that its determination that it was in the overall public interest to deny petitioner's application bore a substantial relation to the Village's legitimate economic development interests in maintaining the integrity of the industrial park in conformance with a comprehensive regional plan. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner, a planned retirement community, brought a CPLR art. 78 proceeding, seeking to annul Local Law 1534-2006, which was enacted by respondent, a county legislature, to extend to residents of planned retirement communities protections similar to those enjoyed by mobile homeowners and multiple dwelling tenants. Petitioner also requested an order permanently enjoining the law's enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court first addressed a procedural matter and determined that petitioner's art. 78 petition was dismissed to the extent that it challenged Local Law 1534 on the ground of insufficient notice of public hearing. To the extent that the petition challenged Local Law 1534 on substantive grounds, the court converted the art. 78 proceeding to a declaratory judgment action. As to petitioner's equal protection challenge, the court found no evidence that petitioner was the sole target of Local Law 1534 and petitioner failed to allege how it was being treated any differently from other planned retirement communities. The court further held that respondent was fully authorized to enact the legislation and no evidence was presented that established that Local Law 1534 was preempted by state law. The court noted that the state legislature had not expressed any intent to preempt local regulation of retirement communities. Lastly, the court found no merit in petitioner's challenge that proper notice of the public hearings was not given as substantial compliance with notice requirements was made and notice was published in various county newspapers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted a declaratory judgment declaring the local law valid in all respects.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A 2007 Suffolk County local law that extended to residents of &quot;planned retirement communities&quot; restricted to tenants 55 years of age or older protections similar to those enjoyed by owners of mobile homes (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Real Property Law &sect; 233) and multiple dwelling tenants (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Real Property Law art 7), including a requirement that charges for rent and utilities be reasonably related to value, was declared to be valid and not preempted by state or federal law. It could not be inferred that the State, by addressing only mobile home parks, intended to preempt regulation of other &quot;ground-lease dwelling communities,&quot; such as retirement communities. The county legislature was authorized under Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 to enact the local law in recognition of the similarity between the plight of retirees and mobile home owners. Furthermore, the local law was not preempted by the State's rent stabilization laws or by the federal Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995 (42 USC &sect; 3607 [b] [2] [C]), a civil rights statute designed to create a senior housing exception to the general prohibition of age discrimination that was not intended to displace nondiscriminatory state or local regulation of housing accommodations.  </SPAN></P>

The notice of public hearing concerning a 2007 Suffolk County local law that extended to residents of &quot;planned retirement communities&quot; restricted to tenants 55 years of age or older protections similar to those enjoyed by owners of mobile homes and multiple dwelling tenants was sufficient. The posting of the notice of public hearing to be conducted by the county legislature on the bulletin board of the clerk of the legislature, as set forth in the affidavit of the clerk stating that the notice was posted not less than three nor more than 15 days before the date of the meeting, complied with the statutory notice requirement (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 20 [5]), notwithstanding that the affidavit did not give the exact date of the posting. Even an untimely posting could still be in substantial compliance with the notice requirement. Furthermore, the notice of public hearing published in both official county newspapers stating that the local law &quot;would enact protections for those who reside in planned retirement communities within the County&quot; complied with the substance and purpose of the notice provision. </SPAN></P>

SDHR found probable cause to believe that district had violated &sect; 296(14) by preventing the use of service dogs by disabled persons in an educational facility. The parents were denied preliminary injunctive relief in their action on the basis that they had not exhausted their administrative remedies under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1400 et seq., and their failure to prove that the student had a speech discrimination score of 40% or less with the appropriate correction under Executive Law &sect; 296(14). Based on that decision, the district sought reconsideration by SDHR of the probable cause determination, which was refused. The court determined that the district had not exhausted its administrative remedies under Executive Law &sect; 298 as the public hearing had not yet been held.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes - Hate Crimes - Selection of Crime Victim Because of Sexual Orientation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendants' conduct in devising a plan to lure a gay man to a remote location in order to rob him fell within the scope of the hate crimes statute, even if their motivation might have been limited to their desire to obtain money and drugs. A hate crime is committed when a person intentionally selects a crime victim &quot;in whole or in substantial part because of a belief or perception regarding the race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation&quot; of that person (Penal Law &sect; 485.05 [1] [a]). The grand jury evidence demonstrated that defendants deliberately set out to commit a violent crime against a man whom they intentionally selected because of his sexual orientation. The statute did not require the People to prove that the crime was motivated by bias, prejudice, or hatred toward the victim. Rather, the statute only required proof of the intentional selection of the victim based on a protected characteristic.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law - Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> - Hate Crimes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Not Unconstitutionally Vague as Applied - Selection of Crime Victim Because of Sexual Orientation</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In the hate crimes prosecution of defendants for intentionally luring a gay man to a remote location in order to rob him, defendants failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to their conduct. A hate crime is committed when a person intentionally selects a crime victim &quot;in whole or in substantial part because of a belief or perception regarding the race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation&quot; of that person (Penal Law &sect; 485.05 [1] [a]). The statute provided clear notice that the intentional selection of a crime victim in whole or in substantial part because of that victim's sexual orientation was prohibited. The term &quot;in whole or in substantial part,&quot; as set forth in the hate crimes statute, was not imprecise; rather, it sufficiently informed people of ordinary intellect that if they searched the Internet for the express purpose of finding a gay man to rob, as defendants did, they would be charged with a hate crime. Nor was the statute rendered unconstitutionally vague by the absence of an express requirement that the commission of the crime have been motivated by bias, prejudice or hate. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A blood specimen showed that defendant had a blood alcohol level of .04 and that the drug Trazodone was present. Section 1192(4) defined &quot;drug&quot; as &quot;defined in this chapter,&quot; whereas &sect; 1192(4-a), which was newly enacted, did not define &quot;drug&quot; or indicate that the word should follow the definition prescribed in &sect; 1192(4). Under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 114-a, the word &quot;drug&quot; included any substance listed in Public Health Law &sect; 3306. Trazodone was not proscribed in &sect; 3306. The court stated that in enacting Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192(4-a), the legislature had the opportunity to amend the definition of the word &quot;drug&quot; under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 114-a or to redefine the term &quot;drug&quot; as applied to the new legislation. The legislature had chosen not to address the issue. The court could not presume that the legislature intended to broaden the definition of &quot;drug&quot; under &sect; 114-a. Accordingly, the court held, the term &quot;any drug or drugs&quot; as used in Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192(4-a) meant any substance listed in Public Health Law &sect; 3306 as required under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 114-a. Accordingly, the charges would be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A felony charge against defendant of driving while his ability was impaired by a combination of alcohol and the drug Trazodone pursuant to the newly enacted Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (4-a) was dismissed, since the drug found in defendant's system was not a proscribed drug under Public Health Law &sect; 3306. The newly enacted statute, effective November 1, 2006, proscribes operating a motor vehicle &quot;while the person's ability to operate such a motor vehicle is impaired by the combined influence of drugs or of alcohol and any drug or drugs,&quot; but does not otherwise define the word &quot;drug.&quot; However, since the term &quot;drug&quot; as used throughout the Vehicle and Traffic Law pertains to any substance listed in Public Health Law &sect;3306 (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 114-a), that statutory definition of the word &quot;drug&quot; applies to a charge under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (4-a), especially in view of the failure of the Legislature to redefine the term &quot;drug&quot; in enacting the new statute. </SPAN></P>

In the employee's interrogatories, he asked questions about the supervisor's religious beliefs, alleging that such questions were relevant to demonstrating the supervisor's bias and intent to discriminate. The supervisor maintained that he did not place his religion at issue and that the employee was terminated for poor work performance. The court concluded that the responses to the interrogatories were being explored for the limited purpose of leading to further evidence to establish that the supervisor's proffered reasons for terminating the employee were a &quot;pretext&quot; and thus, the supervisor was required to answer the questions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee's motion to compel was granted. The supervisor's cross-motion for a protective order was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The attorney/taxpayer claimed that he was an aggrieved taxpayer and property owner and that his tax dollars were being misappropriated to pay non-resident ADAs. He further argued that his clients had been indicted and convicted by non-resident ADAs. The court found that although State Finance Law &sect; 123-b eliminated the need to demonstrate an injury in fact, it could not be used as a pretense to use the expenditure of money to challenge a government decision. The attorney/taxpayer's status as an attorney for criminal defendants did not confer standing upon him. The attorney/taxpayer did not demonstrate that his claimed injury was any different from that common to all taxpayers and citizens. Therefore, he lacked standing under &sect; 123-b and General Municipal Law &sect; 51 to bring the claim against the county officials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant company filed a motion for an order granting summary judgment on its affirmative defenses and counterclaims, and to, inter alia, permanently enjoin plaintiff  town from seeking to remove or alter its advertising signs without compensation pursuant to Highway Law &sect; 88.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 2000, the company received correspondence from the town requesting its cooperation in arranging to have its billboards removed. The company notified the town that it believed that the town could only demand removal of the signs if adequate compensation were paid. The company heard nothing more from the town after the town filed suit in June 2005, seeking a mandatory injunction requiring the company to remove the billboards and the imposition of a civil penalty for a violation of the town code. The court found, inter alia, that the signs at issue were located within 660 feet of a federal aid highway. Therefore, Highway Law &sect; 88 was applicable. That section, by its unambiguous language, provided for just compensation, not amortization. Therefore, the town was required to pay the company just compensation before it could require the company to remove its advertising signs. The company showed good cause to seal an affidavit and an attached appraisal report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The motion for summary judgment was granted, and the application to place an affidavit and an attached appraisal report under seal was granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Highways--Advertising Signs--Taking of Billboards--Payment of Just Compensation for Billboards Covered by Federal Highway Beautification Act </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff Town could not rely on its police power under a town ordinance to require defendant to remove lawfully erected outdoor advertising billboards covered by the Federal Highway Beautification Act of 1965 without paying defendant just compensation. Highway Law &sect; 88 (7) requires a municipality to pay full compensation in accordance with the provisions of article 5 of the Eminent Domain Procedure Law for the removal of billboards covered by the Highway Beautification Act. Consequently, the ordinance's provision for a 10-year amortization period, and not payment of compensation, for billboards covered by Highway Law &sect; 88 was insufficient. The amortization schedules set forth in General Municipal Law &sect; 74-c for the removal of outdoor advertising signs located in areas other than industrial or manufacturing zones are expressly not applicable where, as here, compensation is provided pursuant to Highway Law &sect; 88.  </SPAN></P>

In an action in which defendant succeeded in preventing plaintiff Town from requiring it to remove its lawfully erected outdoor advertising billboards without paying just compensation (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Highway Law &sect; 88 [7]), defendant demonstrated sufficient good cause to seal the court file (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;22 NYCRR 216.1) with respect to an affidavit and attached appraisal report that contained proprietary business information of minimal interest to the public. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After defendant, a town dispatcher, was arrested and charged with misdemeanor crimes of endangering the welfare of a child, third-degree sexual abuse, and first-degree unlawfully dealing with a child, the two town justices disqualified themselves pursuant to CPL 170.15(3), and the action was removed to another local criminal court. One month later, the police chief applied in writing to one of the disqualified town justices for a search warrant of defendant's residence. A videotape found during the search, depicting defendant's former wife and a third party in the marital home recorded by means of surveillance equipment without the consent of either party. That evidence gave rise to a single-count indictment charging defendant with the crime of eavesdropping under Penal Law &sect; 250.05. The court found that town justices' disqualification rendered them without jurisdiction to issue the warrant. Because the search warrant was invalid, pursuant to CPL 690.05, 690.35(2), U.S. Const. amend. IV, and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, the evidence seized from its execution, including the videotape underlying the eavesdropping charge against defendant, had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seizure of evidence from defendant's residence pursuant to a search warrant issued by a town justice who had been disqualified from presiding over defendant's pending misdemeanor charges violated defendant's constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the evidence was suppressed. The authority of a local criminal court to issue a search warrant is regulated by statute and is limited to matters of which the court has jurisdiction (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 690.05, 690.35 [2]). The disqualification of a judge is jurisdictional. Here, because the town justice had properly disqualified himself based on his close working relationship with defendant, he was without jurisdiction to issue the warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, a corporation, was charged with violating a village code by not having a certificate of occupancy and by not having a permit for its brush business. It filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court rejected defendant's argument that CPL 150.40(2), which allowed an appearance ticket for the violation of a zoning law to be served under any manner authorized by CPLR 308, violated due process under both the federal and state constitutions. The key to the commencement of any criminal action was the filing of an appropriate accusatory instrument. Once it was established that a sufficient instrument was filed, the type of service was of little consequence. Next, defendant had raised a sufficient defense of a prior nonconforming use of a substantial nature. It had presented affidavits showing that its property had been used for a brush business since the 1940s. The last serious construction project on the property was concluded in mid-1951, before a 1952 zoning code went into effect. A permit had been filed at that time. Construction under a validly issued permit where the property was a nonconforming use would validate such a use. Furthermore, it was contradictory for the village to seek to find defendant guilty for not having a certificate of occupancy when in 2003 it issued defendant a mercantile permit for the very same purpose and use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court dismissed the summons and information.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In defendant's criminal prosecution for violating a local zoning ordinance by operating a brush business without a business certificate of occupancy or business permit, the service of the appearance ticket by substituted service pursuant to CPLR 308 as authorized by CPL 150.40 (2) was not violative of due process. CPL 150.40 (2), which expanded the means to serve process for violations of local zoning ordinances beyond personal delivery in order to make it easier and less time consuming to serve the violators with appearance tickets, satisfies due process requirements. Jurisdiction in a criminal action is acquired by the filing of a legally sufficient accusatory instrument with the local criminal court. The appearance ticket is merely a letter of invitation. Once it is established that a sufficient accusatory instrument has been filed, the type of service or the means in which the defendant arrives in court is of little consequence.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Nonconforming Use as Defense</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An accusatory instrument charging defendant with violating a local zoning ordinance by operating a brush business without a business certificate of occupancy or business permit was dismissed where defendant demonstrated by substantial evidence that a prior nonconforming use existed on the property prior to the enactment of the appropriate zoning code. Furthermore, the fact that the locality issued defendant a mercantile permit in 2003 to continue and conduct its commercial business on the property operated as a complete defense. Under the local ordinance, registering a business with a mercantile permit ensures that all businesses are in suitable zoning areas and meet fire protection and structure standards. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with a violation of &sect; 168-16 of the Code of the Town of Oyster Bay, New York, alleging that in a park owned and maintained by the Town of Oyster Bay, New York, she was distributing leaflets on behalf of &quot;Jews for Jesus&quot; without a permit. Defendant moved to dismiss the action, or in the alternative, to dismiss the information as defective pursuant to CPL 170.35(l).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance which she was accused to have violated by her distributing religious literature and engaging citizens in conversation about religion in a town park without a permit. The court found that the ordinance acted as a prior restraint on the exercise of First Amendment Rights. Moreover, the ordinance imposed an absolute bar to various forms of speech and did not contain the reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions to provide safeguards for First Amendment liberties. The ordinance also contained no guidelines, standards, or criteria upon which a permit was to be granted or denied. Therefore, the ordinance vested in the town board unfettered discretion in determining whether to grant or deny special permission to engage in a host of constitutionally protected activities. Finally, the ordinance was unconstitutionally applied to defendant when a town official, authorized to entertain her application for a permit, refused to consider her application. However, the allegations in the superceding information that was filed were facially sufficient under CPL 100.40 and 100.15.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner inmate brought a CPLR art. 78 proceeding against respondent commissioner challenging the commissioner's denial of his application to have his confinement transferred to Romania.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commissioner argued that Corrections Law &sect;&sect; 5(4), 71 conferred on the commissioner or his designee sole authority to authorize prisoner transfer requests within the guidelines in the statute and that Correction Law &sect; 5(4) prohibited the commissioner from considering for transfer any prisoner serving a term of life imprisonment. The court found that the plain language of Correction Law &sect; 5(4) addressed only the conversion of an indeterminate sentence to a determinate sentence where necessary to make such person eligible for transfer either to federal custody or to foreign countries. And, although the statute withheld authority to convert a sentence from a maximum of life imprisonment to something less, the language did not include a prohibition against transferring individuals serving a maximum term of life imprisonment. Correction Law &sect; 5(4) clearly envisioned that there would be situations in which sentence conversion was not necessary. Corrections Law &sect; 71 did not restrict eligibility for transfer based on the sentence imposed. The interpretation of the statute used to deny transfer was arbitrary and capricious and based on an error of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant filed a motion to vacate his judgments of conviction entered more than 12 years earlier following a jury trial after he was found guilty of attempted murder in the first degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, two counts of obstructing governmental administration, and one count of resisting arrest, and those convictions were affirmed on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of attempted murder in the first degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, two counts of obstructing governmental administration, and one count of resisting arrest. Defendant appealed and raised as appellate issues: insufficient evidence for attempted murder as accomplice, insufficient evidence of intention to use a weapon unlawfully against another, failure to instruct the jury on the definition of a firearm as related to the charge of Criminal Possession of a Weapon in the Second Degree, and harsh and excessive sentence. The appellate court then denied his appeal. More than 12 years after his convictions were entered, defendant filed a motion to vacate his judgments of conviction and alleged that his trial counsel should have asserted that some of the statutes used to convict him were unconstitutional. The trial court denied his motion because it found that defendant could have raised his claim on appeal and did not do so. However, the trial court also found that it could not find any authority to support his contention and his attorney otherwise provided meaningful representation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's motion to vacate his conviction, based on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel in that his trial counsel failed to argue the constitutionality of several statutes and failed to object to certain jury instructions, was denied since defendant unjustifiably failed to raise the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel upon a prior appeal actually perfected by him (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 440.10 [2] [c]). Because defendant's argument for vacatur did not involve trial strategy concerning his defense, and there were no additional facts that needed to appear on the record for appellate review of the issue, defendant could have pursued the ineffective assistance of counsel issue on his prior appeal. In any event, defendant's trial counsel's conduct did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel; no authority addressing the statutes defendant alleged as being unconstitutional was cited or found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff, a Kuwaiti company, alleged that defendant, a French company, breached and tortiously interfered with a master technical services agreement (MTSA) and agreements between defendant consortium and plaintiff when it refused to use plaintiff as the consortium's agent and appointed another agent for a project in Kuwait. The French company filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The French company and non-party companies created the consortium to bid on contracts to administer environmental monitoring and assessment programs in Kuwait. In the MTSA, the members of the consortium agreed to use plaintiff's services to obtain local labor for environmental studies that were to be performed in Kuwait. Separate agreements between plaintiff and the consortium also provided that plaintiff would provide local labor to the consortium's members. Following the French company's refusal to use plaintiff as its local agent and its appointment of another sponsor, plaintiff commenced the instant action. The court determined that it could exercise long-arm jurisdiction over the French company pursuant to CPLR 302(a)(1) because the French company went to New York several times to negotiate the terms of the MTSA and the negotiations, which included e-mails the French company sent to New York, substantially advanced the formation of the MTSA. The court concluded that dismissal was warranted pursuant to CPLR 327(a) on the ground of forum non conveniens because the parties' dispute had no substantial nexus to New York, and Kuwait and France provided alternative forums.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayers filed suit against defendant county executive seeking a preliminary injunction and a declaratory judgment with respect to an executive order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The executive order required county agencies to recognize same-sex marriages where validly contracted out-of-state. The couple was legally married in Canada and resided in the county. The trial court held that New York recognized out-of-state marriages of heterosexuals that would have been invalid if made in New York if the marriage was valid where contracted. Since there was no legislation or appellate court ruling that declared same-sex marriages out-of-state void in New York, though valid in Canada, there was no positive law to interdict recognition of the marriage. Cases in courts of coordinate jurisdiction were not binding. The appellate court had not changed the law with respect to comity regarding recognition of out-of-state or foreign country marriages valid where contracted. Comity was to be applied in accordance with the attitudes of the community. There had been a change in the county as to the rights of same-sex persons. Thus, the General Municipal Law &sect; 51 claim failed as no illegality was shown. The N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect;&nbsp;2(c) and Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10(1)(i) also claim failed as the executive order was not legislation, but merely the implementation of policy.</SPAN></P>

The executive order constituted a lawful policy-implementing directive in accordance with the current and evolving state of law on recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages as a matter of comity. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, a patient and a non-profit corporation, sought a declaration that L 2005, ch. 63 was unconstitutional and made a motion for an injunction enjoining defendant, state department of health commissioner, from implementing recommendations regarding the closure of a certain healthcare facility. The commissioner, along with defendants, the State and the state department of health, made a cross-motion for summary judgment under CPLR 3211(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The enabling legislation at issue created a commission to develop recommendations for reconfiguring the state's general hospital and nursing home bed supply to align such supply with regional needs. The commission recommended that a certain healthcare facility, which served the patient and senior citizens served by the corporation, be closed. The court determined that the healthcare facility was not required to be joined as a party under CPLR 1001(a) as the facility chose not to intervene and the only cause of action was the constitutionality of the enabling legislation. Plaintiffs could not assert taxpayer standing but had common law standing because they would be adversely affected by an administrative agency's decision. However, plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action because the enabling legislation did not violate N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1 with respect to the non-delegation of legislative powers as the basic policy decision had properly been made by the legislature, which could defer to a commission with specialized knowledge, and sufficient guidelines and standards had been provided for the commission to follow when making its recommendations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action by plaintiffs, a patient at a health care facility facing closure pursuant to the recommendation of the Commission on Health Care Facilities and a nonprofit organization that provided services to senior citizens who used the facility, challenging the enabling legislation that created the Commission and empowered it to make potentially binding &quot;recommendations relating to facilities to be closed and facilities to be resized, consolidated, converted or restructured&quot; throughout the state (s</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 2005, ch 63, part E, &sect; 31), the facility was not a necessary party. To the extent that the facility might claim that the enabling legislation was unconstitutional, the facility's and plaintiffs' interests were interwined and coincided. Further, the facility could have avoided any prejudice by seeking intervention. Finally, plaintiffs' only cause of action involved an issue of law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Constitutional Challenge to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Creating Commission on Health Care Facilities </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiffs, a patient at a health care facility facing closure pursuant to the recommendation of the Commission on Health Care Facilities and a nonprofit organization that provided services to senior citizens who used the facility, lacked taxpayer standing under State Finance Law &sect; 123-b to challenge the constitutionality of the enabling legislation that created the Commission (s</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ee</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 2005, ch 63, part E, &sect; 31). Although state funds will be expended in implementing the Commission's final report, the purpose of the enabling legislation was not the expenditure of state funds. However, the constitutional issue raised by plaintiffs necessitated a ruling on the merits, notwithstanding that plaintiffs' injury did not fall within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the enabling legislation for standing purposes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Separation of Powers -- Recommendations of Commission on Health Care Facilities Regarding Hospital and Nursing Home Closures </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiffs, a patient at a health care facility facing closure pursuant to the recommendation of the Commission on Health Care Facilities and a nonprofit organization that provided services to senior citizens who used the facility, failed to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of the enabling legislation that created the Commission and empowered it to make potentially binding &quot;recommendations relating to facilities to be closed and facilities to be resized, consolidated, converted or restructured&quot; throughout the state (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L 2005, ch 63, part E, &sect; 31). The enabling statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine (NY Const, art III, &sect; 1) by unconstitutionally delegating to the Commission the power to redirect the State's critical health care resources. In view of the complexity and difficulty of the issues involved with streamlining the State's health care system, there was no constitutional violation of the Legislature's deference to a Commission with specialized knowledge so long as adequate standards or guidelines were provided. The general guidelines set forth in the enabling statute authorizing the Commission to utilize an economic/cost-benefit analysis, and the enumerated criteria that were to be used by the Commission in arriving at its recommendations satisfied constitutional requirements. The Legislature was not required to promulgate specific guidelines as to how competing interests and costs were to be weighed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent state department of motor vehicles (DMV) made a motion to dismiss a CPLR art. 78 proceeding pursuant to CPLR 7804(f) and CPLR 3211(a)(7) for failure to state a cause of action. Petitioner licensee sought an order enjoining the DMV from taking an action to suspend or revoke his driver's license as a result of the licensee's alleged refusal to submit to a chemical test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">During the licensee's arraignment on charges of driving while intoxicated based on his refusal to submit to a chemical test after a traffic stop, a notice of temporary suspension of his driver's license was issued under Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1194(2)(b)(3). At the revocation hearing, the licensee's counsel made a motion to dismiss on the basis that the refusal report was left blank with respect to the facts to be set forth by the police officer establishing the reasonable grounds for making the arrest. The motion to dismiss was denied, and the licensee filed an administrative appeal with the DMV. A stay of the suspension of the license was granted; that appeal was still pending. The court determined that a viable claim for a writ of prohibition had been stated because the missing information in the refusal report violated the mandatory requirement of &sect; 1194(2)(b)(2) and, thus, a jurisdictional defect existed. The licensee was not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief because he failed to show irreparable injury as while he asserted that he needed his license to practice law, he did not present any evidence that he had no other form of transportation available to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, whose driver's license was temporarily suspended at his arraignment on charges of driving while intoxicated based on his alleged refusal to submit to a chemical test after a traffic stop, stated a viable claim pursuant to CPLR 7803 (2) to prohibit respondent Department of Motor Vehicles from taking any action to suspend or revoke his license. Respondent lacked jurisdiction over the chemical test refusal hearing because the arresting officer's refusal report was defective for failing to set forth the facts establishing the reasonable grounds for making the arrest both with regard to the traffic infraction supporting the stop and the indicia of petitioner's intoxication. The statutory requirements regarding the contents of the refusal report (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1194 [2] [b] [2]) are considered mandatory in nature in order to satisfy due process concerns. A writ of prohibition was therefore available to petitioner based on allegations that respondent would be acting in excess of the jurisdiction conferred on it by statute. However, petitioner failed to demonstrate irreparable injury in the event he were to lose his license so as to be granted preliminary injunctive relief pending a final determination of this proceeding. </SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs commenced the declaratory judgment action seeking to prevent the recommended closing of the hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commissioner, acting through the Commission, which was created to review the State's health care capacity and resources, recommended closing the hospital. Plaintiffs asserted that the Enabling Act, L 2005, ch. 63, &sect; 31, that created the Commission unconstitutionally delegated the Commissioner's duties under Public Health Law &sect; 2806(6); therefore, it violated the Presentment Clause and Separation of Powers Clause of the New York State Constitution. The court held that while the Commission was charged under the Enabling Act with a comprehensive review of all of the hospitals and nursing homes in the State, the actual power given to the Commission was no greater than the power already vested in the Commissioner. The delegation of power under the Enabling Act was neither so controversial nor so broad to conclude that the legislature would not have been willing to make the delegation without a legislative veto. The court did hold that plaintiffs had a property interest in the hospital's operating license but that no violation of plaintiffs' substantive due process rights occurred since the actions permitted by the Enabling Act were within the boundaries of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The statute creating the Temporary State Commission on Health Care Facilities, which was charged with review of the State's health care delivery system infrastructure and authorized to recommend hospital and nursing home closings and reorganizations, and requiring the Health Commissioner to implement the Commission's recommendations unless those recommendations were rejected by the Legislature (L 2005, ch 63, part E, &sect; 31) is not unconstitutional under the Presentment Clause of the State Constitution (NY Const, art IV, &sect; 7) for failing to provide for the enactment of legislation with presentment to the Governor. Even if the legislative veto is unconstitutional, that provision of the enabling statute may be severed from the other substantive provisions of the statute in view of the statute's comprehensive severance clause. Furthermore, the absence of the legislative veto would not result in an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers, since the actual power given to the Commission without legislative oversight was no greater than the broad power already vested in the Health Commissioner (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 2806 [6]).

While plaintiffs have a protected property interest in their operating certificates (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Public Health Law &sect; 2806 [6]), any termination of that property interest would be rationally related to a legitimate state interest to promote stability and efficiency in the health care delivery system infrastructure, and would thus not violate substantive due process. Furthermore, plaintiffs were afforded procedural due process by having received notice of the deliberations of the Commission and an opportunity to submit written material. A more formal hearing process was not constitutionally required for the Commission to fulfill its legislative mandate. In addition, the absence of a specific provision in the enabling statute providing for judicial review of the Commission's recommendations did not render the statute unconstitutional as violative of due process. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner moved to vacate a warrant charging him with violating the conditions of his post-release supervision. The People opposed the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner claimed that because post-release supervision was not imposed by the judge who sentenced him, but instead by the New York State Department of Correctional Services, the conditions of his post-release supervision were void. Although Penal Law &sect; 70.45 provided that the sentence imposed upon defendant's probation violation also included a term of post-release supervision, the trial court did not announce that it was imposing such a term, and the commitment sheet did not contain a notation that such a term was included in the petitioner's sentence. The appellate court held that because the sentence pronounced by the trial court both orally and in the commitment order made no mention of a period of post-release supervision, and because the sentence was not corrected in a direct proceeding, the sentence announced by the trial court was irrebuttably presumed to have said what it was meant to say, and did not include a period of post-release supervision. The appellate court further held that defendant did not waive his claim, because petitioner did not know of the post-release supervision until the Department of Correctional Services informed him of the condition of release.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The petition was sustained, and the parole warrant was vacated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner's writ of habeas corpus (CPLR 7002 [a]) was granted vacating a parole warrant charging him with violating the conditions of his statutorily-mandated postrelease supervision (Penal Law &sect; 70.45) where the then maximum three-year period of postrelease supervision for his class D violent felony offense was invalidly imposed by the Department of Correctional Services and not by the sentencing court. Since, under the sentencing statute in effect at the time of petitioner's crime, the sentencing court had the discretion to impose a shorter period of mandatory postrelease supervision of not less than 1 1/2 years on petitioner as a first time violent felony offender, the maximum period of postrelease supervision cannot be deemed to have been &quot;judicially imposed&quot; by the automatic operation of law. Furthermore, petitioner did not waive or fail to preserve the constitutional claim that the administratively imposed period of postrelease supervision was invalid. Even if defendant, by his guilty plea, waived the right to appeal, that waiver did not encompass the sentencing claim raised in this proceeding. Moreover, since petitioner was not made aware of the period of postrelease supervision any time before or at sentencing, there was no basis to conclude that he was capable of preserving the claim in the context of the criminal proceeding. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants moved, inter alia, for dismissal of each indictment or a reduction of the charges on the ground of legal insufficiency of the evidence; defendants claimed that the &quot;marital exception&quot; element to third-degree sexual abuse in Penal Law &sect; 130.55 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Two separate grand juries were presented with evidence that defendants committed a series of sexual offenses against their wives. In instructing the grand juries, the assistant district attorneys omitted the language regarding marriage and/or did not proffer a definition of &quot;sexual contact,&quot; thereby omitting any reference to the element that the parties could not be married to each other. The appellate court found that the only possible rationale for the continued constitutionality of the marital exception for third-degree sexual abuse was that a person had an absolute right to conjugal relations with his or her spouse based on an assumption that consent to such relations was implicit in marriage. However, given the established case law finding similar statutes unconstitutional, because the conclusion was inescapable, and because the invalidity of the act was apparent on its face, the court held that the marital exception to PL &sect; 130.55 was unconstitutional. The evidence adduced before each grand jury was legally sufficient to establish the finding of each and every count of both indictments. The grand juries were correctly charged with respect to the applicable law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marital exemption element to sexual abuse in the third degree under Penal Law &sect; 130.55, pursuant to which a married spouse cannot be convicted of subjecting the other spouse to sexual contact without consent, is unconstitutional. Sexual contact includes &quot;any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person not married to the actor for the purpose of gratifying sexual desire of either party&quot; (Penal Law &sect; 130.00 [3]). Spouses have no right to commit crimes in the name of conjugal visits or familial relations. </SPAN></P>

Also, the court found that defendant's ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims were either raised in previous motions, appeals, or could have been raised by defendant via his previous CPL 440.10 applications. Further, defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel was properly brought in an application for a writ of error coram nobis and was not the proper subject of a CPL 440.10 application.

A prior violation of any subparagraph of &sect; 71-2703(2) could serve as a predicate conviction; defendant's interpretation would render parts of the statute meaningless. There was sufficient evidence that defendant individually committed the crime and thus could be held liable under Penal Law &sect; 20.25 for acts performed in the name of his corporation. Defendant had personally contracted with the school district and with the company that supplied the fill; he had personally seen to the fill's unloading and placement; and he personally had a prior conviction. ECL 71-2703(2)(c)(ii) was not unconstitutionally vague. Finally, there was no reason to dismiss in the interests of justice under CPL 210.40(1). The evidence showed that defendant's actions had turned the area into an unlicensed landfill that had required a cleanup. This was a serious offense with serious repercussions, and such a dismissal would be inappropriate, particularly in light of the previous conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant could lawfully be prosecuted under ECL 71-2703 (2) (c) (ii) for illegally disposing of solid waste as a felony based upon allegations that he intentionally dumped several hundred cubic yards of construction and demolition (C &amp; D) debris as &quot;fill&quot; at a public school sports field without a permit pursuant to a contract between his closely held corporation and the school district that required the corporation to supply only approved &quot;fill&quot; for the field.

Defendant personally contracted with a solid waste management facility for delivery of the &quot;fill,&quot; was present when most of the &quot;fill&quot; was delivered and directly supervised its placement and unloading. Furthermore, defendant's prior conviction for a violation involving the illegal dumping of solid waste was a sufficient predicate conviction to elevate the charge to a felony. The statute does not require that the prior conviction have been for a misdemeanor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff consumer filed an action for fraud, forgery, and other claims against defendants, occupants of her property, a checking account holder, two other individuals, and two companies, alleging that they committed identity theft against her which impaired her credit. The checking account holder filed a motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. The action had been discontinued against the companies and one of the individuals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants allegedly opened credit card accounts in the consumer's name without her knowledge. The court found that any claims under the identity theft provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (Act), General Business Law art. 25, were time-barred by General Business Law &sect; 380-n of the Act. Factual issues as to actual damages were established by evidence of harm to the consumer's credit scores. She could seek punitive damages for her common-law fraud claim because the harm done by identity theft had serious public repercussions. Her claim for conspiracy to commit fraud was dismissed because it was not a separate cause of action. A claim that the checking account holder negligently allowed checks to be written to pay bills resulting from the identity theft was dismissed because he owed the consumer no duty to supervise and control his checkbook. Prima facie tort was unavailable because defendants were not motivated by the intent to cause economic harm. The other non-fraud claims were dismissed because they were part of the fraud claim. CPLR 3010(d)(1) did not preclude the consumer from calling an economic expert, but she was directed to disclose all of her experts within 30 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the holder's motion to dismiss all of the consumer's claims except for her claim in common-law fraud. The consumer was directed to disclose the names of all experts she intended to call as witnesses and to provide the holder with their reports and curriculum vitae within 30 days. The holder was given 30 days of receiving the names of experts to schedule depositions, and all discovery was to be completed within 90 days.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiff failed to state a statutory claim for identity theft against defendants under General Business Law &sect; 380-s where the complaint alleged that defendants began their identity theft scheme by opening credit card accounts in plaintiff's name in May 2002, prior to the November 1, 2002 effective date of the statute, notwithstanding that plaintiff did not learn of the fraudulent accounts until January 2003. A statute that creates a new right of action that did not previously exist generally has only a prospective application. Consequently, the identity theft statute did not apply to defendants' conduct that occurred prior to November 1, 2002. However, plaintiff did state a claim for common-law fraud and put forth sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether she incurred actual damages because of the negative impact to her &quot;credit rating&quot; resulting from the identity theft scheme. Furthermore, plaintiff was allowed to seek recovery of punitive damages since defendants' actions, if proven, involved a high degree of moral culpability that caused harm not only to plaintiff but to the general public as well. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Claimant corporation brought a small claims action against defendant, who was 78 years old, alleging that defendant had failed to pay real estate commissions. At defendant's request, the court transferred the action to the day Small Claims Part under NY City Civ Ct Act &sect; 1815 based on defendant's age.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Under &sect; 1815, senior citizens, disabled persons, and night workers could bring an action in day court. The court stated that &sect; 1815 did not give such a privilege to a defendant. The statute, however, was unconstitutional under the equal protection provision of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The purpose of &sect; 1815 was to protect specific groups of persons, not claimants; thus, because a person's age or disability was the important consideration, the fact that the right did not attach to defendants made &sect; 1815&nbsp;unconstitutional. Moreover, &sect; 1815 required the clerk of court to tell all claimants who appeared to qualify that they could have their case heard in day court. This procedure was also questionable, as a clerk could not be expected to guess a claimant's age or to detect a nonvisible disability. Next, the court declined claimant's application to restore the case to the night calendar. Claimant, as a corporation, could not assert that it was a hardship for it to appear during the day. Furthermore, although claimant argued that other members of defendant's law firm could appear at night on his behalf, claimant had not brought suit against the firm but against defendant individually.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defendant, a senior citizen more than 65 years old, was entitled to have plaintiff's small claims action to recover real estate commissions transferred to day court, notwithstanding the fact that a defendant in a small claims action has no statutory right to request such a transfer. CCA 1815, which grants senior citizens and persons with disabilities the right as claimants to have their cases heard during the day, is unconstitutional as written. The right to have a case heard in day Small Claims Part must be provided to defendants and not just claimants in order to carry out the statute's intent to protect the rights of persons over age 65 and those with disabilities. The Legislature should establish a procedure for a party to assert this right, whether by motion or answer or some other method, and should also establish a procedure for notifying the public of the existence of this right. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state trial court had not submitted the weapons counts to the jury in defendant's original trial.

The indictment did not violate constitutional double jeopardy protections where defendant failed to object to the state trial court's decision not to submit the weapons counts to the jury. Thus, he had impliedly consented to their dismissal and could not argue that his right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal was violated. Moreover, the failure to submit the counts to the jury was not a determination that the evidence was legally insufficient. However, the indictment did violate defendant's statutory double jeopardy protections because the federal court, by ordering a conditional release, had not implicitly authorized a reprosecution of the weapons counts. The weapons counts were not before the federal judge who had granted the habeas petition. Those counts had already been dismissed. Thus, the exemption of CPL 40.30(4) did not apply.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, intervenor Unified Court System also had standing and an interest in ensuring that a local law did not usurp the exclusive authority of the courts to hear and determine cases or impede the power of the courts as a coequal branch of government.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Local Laws -- Preemption by State -- Constitutionality of Local Law Creating Administrative Tribunal to Adjudicate Zoning Violations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A local law enacted by defendant Town that created an alternative administrative tribunal to hear and adjudicate all zoning and land use violations was declared unconstitutional as impermissibly usurping the judicial function without express legislative authorization. The State Legislature preempted the field regarding the creation and operation of local adjudicatory boards. The Legislature empowered the Suffolk County District Court with the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate all land use violations within the Town (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art VI, &sect; 6; Town Law &sect;&sect; 135, 268 [1]; Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 11 [1]; UDCA 203). The local law unconstitutionally transferred certain judicial proceedings and adjudications from the District Court to the newly established Zoning Violations Bureau. Moreover, the local law created an inherent conflict of interest by providing for the appointment of an &quot;independent&quot; hearing officer by the Town Attorney who would also be prosecuting the zoning law violations. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Three of defendant cyclists were charged with disorderly conduct by obstructing vehicular or pedestrian traffic and parading without a permit; a fourth defendant cyclist was charged only with disorderly conduct. Each cyclist moved for dismissal of all charges as facially insufficient, and the three charged with parading without a permit challenged that law as unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The complaint alleged that the cyclists were riding in a group of four. The cyclists argued that the accusatory instrument failed to set forth facts establishing that the cyclists participated in a procession, parade, or race for which a permit was required and that a permit was not obtained. The court held that the activity in which the cyclists were alleged to be engaging did not come within the language of New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 10.110. The court concluded that to interpret &sect;&nbsp;10.110 to include an event which was not specifically described in the statute would render it unconstitutionally vague. The court went on to find &sect;&nbsp;10.110 was unconstitutional because it required even small groups to obtain permits, without justification, and applied strict liability. Next, the court noted that the officer's conclusory allegations that the cyclists did not have a permit was inadmissible hearsay that did not satisfy the standards of CPL 100.15(3). Finally, the court concluded that the charges were sufficient to sustain the disorderly conduct charges against one cyclist, as they alleged that the one cyclist obstructed traffic by failing to obey a traffic signal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The charges of parading without a permit were dismissed. The disorderly conduct charges were dismissed as to all but the cyclist who ran a red light.</SPAN></P>

Interpreting the statute broadly to apply to an unorganized group of bicyclists would render the statute unconstitutionally vague, since individuals would not be given fair notice of the type of conduct that was prohibited. Moreover, interpreting the permit scheme to apply to a small group of friends bicycling together would render the statute facially unconstitutional as overbroad on First Amendment grounds, since the statute would not be narrowly tailored to address the City's legitimate interest in regulating parades and other large gatherings which may disrupt traffic and create the potential for disorder. Furthermore, if the statute did apply to defendants' conduct, it would be deemed unconstitutional for improperly imposing strict liability on all participants in an event that required a permit, regardless of whether they knew that the event lacked a permit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Disorderly Conduct -- Riding Bicycles Four Abreast through City Streets -- Obstructing Traffic by Slowly Riding Bicycle through Red Light at Intersection </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the absence of any allegation that defendants intended to obstruct traffic or otherwise create a public disturbance by their conduct, they could not lawfully be prosecuted for disorderly conduct (Penal Law &sect; 240.20 [5]) merely for having slowly ridden their bicycles four abreast at night through the Theatre District in Manhattan. At best, the complaints alleged only a temporary inconvenience to an unspecified number of cars that were required to switch lanes. However, the disorderly conduct charge was sustained against a bicyclist who allegedly rode her bicycle at a slow rate of speed through a red light at an intersection along with a large group of other cyclists, thereby preventing vehicles and pedestrians from passing and moving forward in the street. Moreover, the allegation that the bicyclist committed a traffic infraction by failing to obey a traffic signal provided a basis for inferring that she intended to cause public inconvenience or recklessly created a risk of it. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff was involved in an automobile accident with a rental car driven by defendant driver.

The court found that 49 USC.S. &sect; 30106 (2005) did not confer a right or immunity that was essential to plaintiff's cause of action. Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 388 defined the scope of vicarious liability as part of the substantive law of torts, and it had nothing to do with &quot;commerce.&quot; Therefore, because &sect; 388 was a legislative act within the New York State Legislature's inherent authority under US Const. amend.

The power to pass upon the constitutionality of the federal statute under the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8 [3]) and the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution did not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts in the absence of any federal law that specifically withdrew from the state courts the power to do so.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A tort claim under New York's vicarious liability statute (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 388) against the lessor of a motor vehicle involved in an automobile accident was not barred by the federal Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (49 USC &sect; 30106), which expressly preempts all state vicarious liability statutes to the extent that they hold owners in the business of renting or leasing vehicles vicariously liable for the negligence of drivers, except when there is negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner. Congress exceeded its constitutional authority under the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8 [3]) in abrogating New York's long-standing substantive tort law. The vicarious liability statute merely defines the scope of vicarious liability attributable to motor vehicle owners as an integral part of New York's substantive tort doctrine of imputed liability. The vicarious liability law does not have a &quot;substantial effect&quot; on interstate commerce that would justify congressional action in the substantive area of New York's civil tort law. Legislating in that area falls within the scope of powers traditionally reserved to the states under the 10th Amendment to the United States Constitution. </SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 7-210 (2003), liability for injuries arising from the sidewalk defect claimed herein shifted from the City to the owners of the abutting real property. The court agreed that &sect; 7-210(b) applied since the real property at issue was not a residential property. The court disagreed with the property owners' contention that only defects were covered since even before the enactment of the local law, property owners had a statutory obligation to maintain sidewalks abutting their properties. The court also found no taking of the property, since no physical invasion or ouster was claimed or demonstrated by the property owners, and the City made a prima facie showing that &sect; 7-210 and its related enactments bore a reasonable connection to the public's health, safety, and welfare.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant City of New York could not be held liable in a personal injury action based upon plaintiff's slip and fall on an uneven sidewalk in front of the codefendants' commercial premises that took place just four days after the effective date of the City's Sidewalk Law, which shifted the City's liability for injuries arising from sidewalk defects to the abutting property owners, other than small owner-occupied homes, regardless of whether the City had prior written notice of the defective condition (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 7-210 [c]). It was not inequitable to impose liability upon codefendants for the defective sidewalk condition which was in existence prior to the effective date of the Sidewalk Law, since the law imposes no additional maintenance duty upon abutting landowners than existed under prior law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Administrative Code &sect;&sect; 16-123, 19-152).  </SPAN></P>

The codefendant abutting commercial landowners in a personal injury action based upon plaintiff's slip and fall on an uneven sidewalk in front of their commercial premises failed to demonstrate that the operation of the Sidewalk Law &quot;completely&quot; deprived them of &quot;all economically beneficial&quot; use of their property or interfered with a distinct investment-backed expectation so as to constitute a regulatory &quot;taking.&quot; Furthermore, the law's liability insurance requirement does not constitute an unreasonable exercise of municipal power.

Defendants were not entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the adoption of the Sidewalk Law.

Defendants failed to demonstrate that the Sidewalk Law treats them any differently than similarly situated owners of commercial property and multiple dwellings. Furthermore, the exception in the law for one-, two- and three-family homes has a rational basis in view of the legislative findings that small property owners who reside on the premises were less likely than commercial property owners to have the financial resources to bear the costs of sidewalk maintenance and repairs and that two thirds of sidewalk defect-related tort cases filed against the City involved sidewalks abutting commercial properties and multiple dwellings. </SPAN></P>

The allegations allowed the jury to determine whether defendant acted with intent to harass the victim when he made a threatening call to her home. The statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Defendant's phone calls were not made in protest against governmental acts, included threats of an obscene sexual attack, and were addressed to the victim at her home.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a neglect matter involving respondent mother's two minor children, a county department of human services submitted a permanency hearing report indicating that an anti-psychotic drug had been prescribed for the three-year-old child over the mother's objection. The permanency planning hearing was advanced for a prompt determination of the extent of the department's authority to override the mother's objection in administering the medication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The child's behavior was normal when she was placed in foster care, but five months later, she showed behavior problems. The department's foster care clinic medical director prescribed depakote sprinkles based on a consultant physician's suggestion. The department advised the mother of the decision. She objected, but a department caseworker signed a consent form, and the medication was given. During the hearing, the court issued a preliminary order vacating the department's decision. At the close of the hearing, it confirmed the preliminary order. Neither N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 383-b nor N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 507.1 authorized the department to administer mental health medications over a parent's objections. The mother's fundamental liberty interests were violated. Mental health medication could not be prescribed to a child in foster care over a parent's objection unless a court found, after a de novo hearing with counsel, that the proposed treatment was narrowly tailored to give substantive effect to the child's liberty interests. The burden was on the department to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that a proposed medication met these criteria.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court confirmed its preliminary order that had vacated the department's decision to medicate the child. It directed that the department was not to administer any anti-psychotic drug to the child on a non-emergency basis over the objection of the mother without a further order of a court of competent jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Social Services -- Foster Care -- Administration of Antipsychotic Drug to Child over Parent's Objection -- Due Process</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administrative consent procedure utilized by petitioner social services agency in approving the administration of an antipsychotic drug to a three-year-old child in foster care to treat the child's behavioral and emotional problems over the objections of respondent mother was constitutionally invalid to the extent that respondent was merely provided with notice of a decision already made and was not afforded a real opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. Under the circumstances, respondent's due process rights and the fundamental liberty interests of both parent and child were ignored. The decision to medicate the child was based on hearsay and limited information and was made without any complete professional evaluation of an existing mental health issue. Social Services Law &sect; 383-b, which broadly authorizes a social services agency to consent to immediately necessary medical, dental, health and hospital treatment for an abused or neglected child in foster care when no parent is available to consent, does not authorize the nonemergency use of psychotropic drugs on children over parental objection. Rather, if the parent of a child in foster care opposes the administration of mental health medicine, the medicine cannot lawfully be prescribed unless the agency establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed treatment is narrowly tailored to give substantive effect to the child patient's liberty interest. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff recipient filed suit in the trial court (New York) against defendant sender under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 227 (2006), seeking damages and injunctive relief for unsolicited advertisements sent by the sender to the recipient's fax machine. The recipient moved for partial summary judgment, injunctive relief, and dismissal and summary judgment as to the sender's affirmative defenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The recipient received 14 faxes from the sender. The trial court held that the faxes were advertisements as they had the purpose and effect of influencing recipients to procure the sender's services. That the sender sent the faxes on behalf of a for-profit law office confirmed their commercial nature. The faxes were sent without permission. A summary judgment had been entered against the sender for a TCPA violation. The sender willfully and knowingly violated the TCPA. The TCPA was constitutional. The sender's claim that the TCPA only applied to interstate calls was rejected. The recipient's request for an injunction barring the sender from sending further faxes was rejected as the recipient did not show that the sender was likely to continue sending faxes. Given the TCPA's lack of an express limitations period and the uncertainty in selecting an analogous state statute of limitations, the four-year statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1658 applied to TCPA actions. The sender's unclean hands defense was meritless as the recipient did not engage in unconscionable conduct by publishing his fax number in an attorney directory. The sender's laches defense was also meritless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Partial summary judgment was granted to the recipient and against the sender as to liability on the damages claim. The damages were to be determined at trial. Summary judgment was denied with respect to the recipient's request for an injunction, and that claim was dismissed. The sender's constitutionality, statute of limitations, unclean hands, and laches affirmative defenses were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with violating Rochester, N.Y., City Code &sect; 44-4, the Aggressive Panhandling Act. He moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was arrested for violating the Aggressive Panhandling Act, Rochester, N.Y., City Code &sect; 44-4, by holding a sign asking for help on a public sidewalk. The Act, as applied, unconstitutionally burdened his right to expression. It was not proved that barring his conduct did not burden substantially more speech than necessary to achieve the city's legitimate substantial interests. Neither his sign nor his conduct embraced unsafe or unwanted behaviors the city could legitimately prohibit, nor were they intimidating, harassing, threatening, or potentially dangerous to pedestrian or vehicular traffic flow. He silently held a sign saying, &quot;Homeless. Hungry. Please Help.&quot; The government did not show its legitimate interests would be achieved less effectively if it did not bar his conduct. No causal link was shown between this and the intimidation of passers-by or the disruption of traffic flow. As applied, Rochester, N.Y., City Code &sect; 44-4(H) violated the First Amendment and N.Y. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8 as it was not narrowly tailored to meet the city's legitimate and substantial objectives of preventing unsafe and threatening speech and maintaining traffic flow.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence that defendant approached or initiated any conversations with any pedestrians or motorists or impeded any pedestrian or vehicular traffic. Under these circumstances, the ordinance as applied unconstitutionally infringed defendant's First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The ordinance as applied was not narrowly tailored to serve the municipality's legitimate and substantial governmental interests in preventing unsafe and threatening speech and maintaining traffic flow. Neither defendant's conduct nor his sign was, or could be perceived to be, intimidating, harassing, threatening, or potentially dangerous to the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The terminated employee was provisionally appointed as a plumbing inspector for the city department of buildings. While he was still a provisional employee, his employment was terminated. He claimed that his termination violated Civil Service Law &sect; 75-b because he had reported to his supervisor that he had been offered a bribe while on the job, which he rejected. He added that he received the telephone number for the Department of Investigations (DOI) from the supervisor and reported the bribe incident to the DOI on the same day as he made the report to the supervisor. The city building commissioner in an answer claimed that the terminated employee, as a provisional employee, could be terminated for any reason and that his inadequate job performance constituted a good faith basis for his termination. The trial court found that in the CPLR art. 78 proceeding before it, the trial court had to determine whether the Civil Service Law &sect; 75-b(2) requirement, that of allowing a reasonable time between the report to the supervisor and the report to the DOI, had been met and, if so, whether the city building commissioner had shown a good faith basis for his termination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A provisionally appointed employee is entitled to assert a claim under the &quot;whistleblower&quot; statute (Civil Service Law &sect; 75-b). The statute broadly extends &quot;whistleblower&quot; protection to &quot;any person holding a position by appointment or employment in the service of a public employer.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner, a provisionally appointed plumbing inspector for the New York City Department of Buildings whose employment was terminated after he complained to his supervisor about his coworkers' poor job performance and a bribery attempt, was entitled to a hearing pursuant to CPLR 7804 (h) to determine whether his discharge violated the &quot;whistleblower&quot; statute (Civil Service Law &sect; 75-b) only with respect to the bribery attempt. Although both instances of alleged misconduct reported by petitioner fell within the scope of the &quot;whistleblower&quot; statute as conduct &quot;regarding a violation of a law, rule or regulation which violation creates and presents a substantial and specific danger to the public health or safety,&quot; petitioner's failure to report the alleged misconduct of his coworkers to a government body in compliance with the statute's reporting requirement required dismissal of that claim. Reporting to both an appointing authority, in this case petitioner's supervisor, and a governmental body is necessary to make a retaliatory discharge claim under the statute. Questions of fact existed as to whether petitioner satisfied the statute's reporting requirement with respect to the bribery attempt. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In cases joined together for decision, five petitioners filed applications seeking to be relieved of the obligation to register as sex offenders pursuant to the New York Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 168-a et seq. The People opposed the petitioners' applications for exemption from the SORA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Each petitioner was convicted of either unlawful imprisonment, kidnapping, or both. None of the petitioners were accused of sexual conduct with the victims. These offenses were sex offenses under N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 168-a(2)(a)(i). Petitioners argued that the New York Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 168-a et seq., violated equal protection and due process as applied to them because they had not been accused of sexual conduct. The constitutionality of the SORA was considered under rational basis scrutiny. The trial court determined that the SORA bore a rational relationship to a legitimate government objective. Kidnapping, as defined under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 135.20, and unlawful imprisonment of a child, as defined under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 135.10, were often precursor offenses to sex offenses against children. It was lawful for the legislature to impose enhanced criminal sanctions for those who created a risk of violence. Thus, it had the power to make defendants who created a risk of sexual abuse subject to registration requirements that were only civil in nature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sex Offenders -- Application of Sex Offender Registration Act to Nonparent Convicted of Kidnapping or Unlawful Imprisonment of Minor </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), which subjects a nonparent convicted of kidnapping or unlawful imprisonment of a minor to registration as a sex offender regardless of any evidence of sexual contact or motivation (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Correction Law &sect; 168-a [2] [a] [i]), was not unconstitutional as applied to petitioners. Nor did SORA afford petitioners, who did not have sexual contact with their minor victims but were convicted of kidnapping and/or unlawful imprisonment, the right to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether they should be subject to registration. The purpose of SORA is to conform New York law to the requirements of the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Program (42 USC &sect; 14071, as amended by Megan's Law, Pub L 104-145, 110 US Stat 1345 [JWA]). JWA requires every state to adopt a registration program for sexual predators, sexually violent offenders, and persons convicted of a criminal offense against a minor, and mandates that kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment of a minor by a nonparent be included in any state registration program for federal funding purposes (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">42 USC &sect; 14071 [a] [3] [A] [i], [ii]). Including those offenses as sex offenses subject to registration and notification bears a rational relationship to the legitimate governmental objective of protecting children from sexual abuse in view of the recognized link between those crimes and the risk of sexual abuse. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant allegedly had material showing nudity and sexual activity. He said a probation condition barring possession of such material was overbroad and its enforcement violated his First Amendment rights and denied substantive due process. The condition was not unconstitutional. His claim that the condition was overbroad was limited by the fact he consented to it, so it did not apply to anyone else. His First Amendment rights were limited by the fact he was a sex offender on probation after a felony conviction. The condition was fundamentally rehabilitative. If its prohibition against viewing nudity was overbroad, its prohibition against possessing depictions of sexual conduct was constitutional, directly related to his crime, and related to his rehabilitation. The condition properly limited his First Amendment rights. The images he allegedly had were not in a gray area in which he unsuspectingly found himself. He did not show he was denied substantive due process.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The special condition of defendant's probation prohibiting him from possessing materials which depict nudity or actual or simulated sexual conduct of any kind was not unconstitutionally overbroad or violative of his First Amendment and substantive due process rights. Defendant, who pleaded guilty to third degree rape of an underage student at the school where he worked, consented on the record and in writing to that specific condition when he was placed on probation. His First Amendment rights were circumscribed by the fact that he was a sex offender placed on probation after a felony conviction and was the only person affected by the probation condition. Moreover, there was a legitimate reason for the condition. The probation department attached it as a means of ensuring that defendant followed his course of treatment, and its inclusion was fundamentally rehabilitative. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Specifically, defendant claimed that &sect; 125.12 violated his due process rights, was vague, and created an impermissible mandatory presumption against him.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penal Law &sect; 125.12 (1), which, in a prosecution for vehicular manslaughter in the second degree, creates a rebuttable presumption that the element of the crime that the defendant caused the death of another person as the result of operating a motor vehicle in an intoxicated condition is established upon proof that the defendant operated the vehicle while unlawfully intoxicated in violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (2)-(4), is not unconstitutional on its face. The statutory presumption is permissive, not mandatory, and it cannot be said that based upon common experience no rational connection exists between the manner in which a motor vehicle is operated and its driver's blood alcohol content. Moreover, permissive presumptions in criminal statutes may not be attacked on their face. Furthermore, the statutory language &quot;in a manner that causes the death&quot; is not unconstitutionally vague. The objected-to language clearly requires a defendant's intoxication to be causally connected to the cause of death, which must be proven by the People beyond a reasonable doubt, and the statute is not incapable of any valid application. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner's daughter was arrested for driving the owner's vehicle while intoxicated.

The owner filed a motion to dismiss, which included an affidavit stating that the owner had no reason to know that the daughter would drive the vehicle under the influence of alcohol. That affirmative defense which the owner filed was known as the &quot;innocent owner&quot; defense and was contained in Nassau County, N.Y., Administrative Code &sect; 8-7.0(g)(4)(f). The trial court ordered that her motion be converted to a motion for summary judgment. The county filed a summary judgment cross-motion asserting that her statement of lack of knowledge was insufficient to raise a proper affirmative defense under the administrative provision. The trial court granted the owner's summary judgment motion upon finding that her simple statement and the lack of rebuttal of it by the county was sufficient to show she was an &quot;innocent owner&quot; entitled to summary judgment pursuant to the administrative provision.</SPAN></P>

Nassau County Administrative Code &sect; 8-7.0 (g) (4) (f) provides an affirmative defense to a forfeiture action where the owner other than the person arrested did not know or had no reason to know that there was a reasonable likelihood that the vehicle would be used illegally. The noncriminal defendant owner bears the burden of pleading and proving that he or she was ignorant of the illegal use. Here, defendant showed by documentary and affidavit proof that she was the owner and had no reason to know the daughter would use the vehicle illegally. This proof was sufficient to shift the burden to the County to demonstrate that there was a reason for defendant to have a belief, which it failed to do. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners, who owned recently built or improved homes in the town, claimed that the assessors acted illegally or improperly by using a method of assessment that encompassed two entirely different procedures for determining a property's assessed value, thus creating a disparity between the assessed values of two groups of otherwise similar properties. The court found that a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding was an appropriate vehicle for obtaining judicial review because the owners' challenge was to the constitutionality of the method employed in the assessment involving several properties. Further, the owners were not deemed to have elected their remedies by challenging their individual assessments on the grounds permitted in a Small Claims Assessment Review proceeding under N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law art. 7. Furthermore, the owners proceeding was not untimely. Finally, the town's assessment method was unconstitutional because the owners' newly-reassessed properties were assessed at a greater proportion of actual market value. Therefore, the owners bore a greater proportion of the tax burden than the owners of other, comparable properties that had not been recently built or improved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The assessors' motion was denied, and the owners' petition was granted. The assessors were directed to recompute the owners' assessments for the tax year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Respondent Town Assessor acted in an unconstitutionally discriminatory manner by assessing petitioners' newly built or recently improved properties using a method based on actual, current market value while assessing comparable homes that have not been recently built or improved using a more favorable method based on 1965 values, resulting in the owners of newly reassessed properties bearing a greater proportion of the tax burden. While reassessment of properties that have been improved is not itself improper and the process used to value petitioners' properties was not otherwise inherently flawed or improper, the use of one procedure based on current market value to assess only newly improved properties resulted in discriminatory treatment that served no legitimate governmental interest. Moreover, the fact that petitioners had pending claims challenging the propriety of their individual assessments did not preclude them from challenging the method used to reach those assessments in a CPLR article 78 proceeding. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant pleaded guilty to the criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 220.03. He subsequently filed a motion under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10 to vacate the judgment of conviction, claiming that he was not advised of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea and that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 200.50(7) deprived him of his constitutional right to due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1996, the Immigration and Nationality Act was amended to almost mandate deportation of an alien convicted of a crime that related to a controlled substance, as seen in 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) and 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1228(b)(5) (the amendment). Defendant argued that as deportation was automatic, it was a direct consequence of a conviction and that the trial court should have advised him of that fact. In considering his motion to vacate, the court, after discussing the holdings of other jurisdictions on the issue, adopted the findings of the federal courts and held that under New York law, deportation remained a collateral consequence of a plea despite the amendment and that the failure to warn a defendant that his plea subjected him to deportation was not a ground on which to vacate a conviction. N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10 provided in part that a failure to advise a defendant of deportation did not affect a plea's voluntariness or a conviction's validity. The court also ruled that as deportation was a collateral consequence of a plea, there was no constitutional due process right to be informed of the consequence of deportation, and &sect; 440.10 did not deny any due process right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied defendant's motion to vacate his conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial court's failure to advise defendant, an alien who pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree in violation of Penal Law &sect; 220.03, that he was subject to deportation under the 1996 amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act did not violate defendant's constitutional due process rights or require vacatur of defendant's conviction. A court must inform a defendant only of the direct consequences of a conviction. Mandatory deportation is not a direct consequence, but rather a collateral consequence, as it is imposed by an independent agency and not the court. Moreover, although CPL 220.50 (7) provides that a court must advise certain defendants that a plea of guilty may result in deportation, the statute also provides that the failure to so advise a defendant does not affect the voluntariness of the plea or the validity of the conviction. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The information alleged that defendant and a group of other men were jumping up and down, jostling each other, and chanting &quot;DDP.&quot; The trial court held that there was no allegation that the conduct was violent or that anyone else was present. The group's purpose was found to be to engage in tumultuous conduct. It could not be inferred that the group's purpose was to engage in violent conduct or to cause public alarm. Further, there was no allegation that defendant intended to act to cause public alarm. The allegation that &quot;DDP&quot; was a gang chant did not mean that it was an incitement to imminent lawless action or that it contained fighting words. The First and Fourteenth Amendments did not permit the exercise of the right to assembly to be made criminal simply because it was annoying. Thus, the unlawful assembly charge failed. The disorderly conduct charge also failed. Although defendant was in a public park, there were no allegations that defendant's conduct annoyed or interfered with anyone. Further, there was no allegation that defendant persisted in the conduct after warnings, or that his conduct created a risk of disorder.

There were no facts stated in the information from which it could have been inferred that the group's purpose was to engage in violent conduct, since they were neither acting violently, nor making statements which incited violence. There were also no facts from which it could be inferred that their purpose was to cause public alarm, because there were no allegations that any members of the public were present. Moreover, the group's chanting of the phrase &quot;DDP&quot; did not bring the alleged conduct within the statute, as the information did not allege that the words &quot;DDP&quot; were an &quot;incitement to imminent lawless action&quot; or &quot;fighting words&quot; which may properly be regulated.  </SPAN></P>

Although the information alleged that defendant acted in a concededly public place, there were no allegations that anyone was present other than defendant, his companions, and the arresting officer, and therefore there was no allegation that defendant annoyed, disturbed, or interfered with any member of the public. Moreover, the information failed to allege that defendant's conduct actually annoyed anyone, that defendant persisted in the conduct after warnings by the police or others, or that his conduct created even a risk of disorder. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, several dancers and a dance club (dancers), sought a preliminary injunction to prevent defendants, the New York City Planning Commission, the New York City Department of Buildings, and the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs (City), from enforcing New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 20-360 (the cabaret law) and the New York City Zoning Resolution. The City cross-moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The dancers argued that social dancing was expression protected under the New York Constitution and that the cabaret law and the Resolution infringed upon their right of expression. The trial court held that the cabaret law was constitutional, on its face and as applied to the dancers, as social dancing was not recognized as expressive communication either by the First Amendment or N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The cabaret law was reasonably related to public safety and welfare, and, assuming that the dancers had a due process interest that the cabaret law restricted, the dancers failed to show that the cabaret law was so arbitrary that it violated substantive due process. The Resolution, as applied, was not arbitrary and capricious and did not deprive the dancers of due process of law under N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. Social dancing was not constitutionally protected as expressive conduct, and the Resolution was a reasonable exercise of the City's police power and bore a substantial relationship to the health, safety, and welfare of New Yorkers. Finally, as it was debatable whether dancing should have been restricted to Use Group 12, the City's judgment was not arbitrary or irrational.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The dancers' motion for a preliminary injunction was denied. The City's cross-motion was granted, and the complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Regulation of Participatory Social Dancing -- Validity of Cabaret Licensing Law and Related Zoning Provisions </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York City's Cabaret Law (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 20-360) and related zoning provisions are not unconstitutional to the extent that they regulate the circumstances under which participatory social dancing is permitted in eating and drinking establishments and the location of those establishments throughout New York City. Participatory recreational/social dancing as an activity does not rise to the level of protected expressive conduct under the State Constitution (NY Const, art I, &sect; 8). Plaintiffs failed to rebut the presumption of the constitutionality of the City's Cabaret Law. A licensing requirement for eating and drinking establishments that offer participatory social dancing is not arbitrary. The Cabaret Law is reasonably related to public safety and welfare. The City has a legitimate public interest in regulating bars, clubs, and restaurants and the circumstances under which they may offer patrons the opportunity to dance. The fact that an establishment may conform to building and fire codes does not assure that its space is adequate or appropriate for social dancing. Furthermore, application of the zoning provisions that limit participatory social dancing to certain commercial districts is not arbitrary and capricious. The zoning restrictions constitute a reasonable exercise of the police power to control noise and congestion and bear a substantial relationship to the health, safety and general welfare of the public. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was ticketed for aggressive panhandling in violation of Rochester, N.Y., Municipal Code &sect; 44-4(H). Before trial in a lower court in New York, defendant moved to dismiss the accusatory instrument. The lower court granted defendant's motion and dismissed the charges pending against defendant. The People of the State of New York appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Rochester, N.Y., Municipal Code &sect; 44-4(H) forbid the approaching of vehicles on the street by panhandlers for a contribution. Defendant, who allegedly walked into traffic on an exit ramp to a city street and solicited funds from passing motorists, successfully argued in the court below that &sect; 44-4(H) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that the governmental interest at issue as to &sect; 44-4(H), prohibiting interference with the free flow of vehicular traffic and promoting traffic safety, was a compelling interest and directly promoted by the regulation. Further, while some incidental burden existed on First Amendment freedoms, the governmental interest at issue was unrelated to the limited ban on free expression. Any incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms was no greater than was essential to the furtherance of that interest. Therefore, the ordinance, as written, was content neutral. Additionally, &sect; 44-4(H), as written, was sufficiently narrowly tailored to pass constitutional muster. Moreover, the ordinance clearly left open ample alternative channels of communication. Finally, the ordinance was not overly broad. Thus, the ordinance was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A municipal ordinance that prohibits various forms of &quot;aggressive&quot; panhandling by persons approaching cars stopped in traffic is not unconstitutionally overbroad. Although the otherwise content-neutral ordinance implicates some constitutionally protected expressive activity, it was sufficiently narrowly tailored to address legitimate public safety and traffic concerns while at the same time protecting the First Amendment rights of persons engaged in the nonaggressive solicitation of funds or the mere communication of thoughts and ideas. The municipality acted within its authority to limit words or acts of solicitation directed at the occupants of motor vehicles, an activity that presents a threat to vehicular and pedestrian safety. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court sentenced defendant to a one-year conditional discharge for a conviction of criminal contempt in the second degree after defendant entered a plea of guilty to the charge. As a condition of the conditional discharge and the order of protection issued, defendant agreed to a provision prohibiting him from entering New York City, New York, for three years unless he made an application to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to criminal contempt in the first degree and criminal contempt in the second degree. Defendant was a Pennsylvania resident and expressed to the court that he did not want to be placed on probation in New York. The court agreed to dismiss the felony count of criminal contempt in the first degree and to release defendant on a conditional discharge if defendant completed a batterer intervention program. In that event, the court would give defendant a conditional discharge along with an order of protection as defendant agreed to stay out of New York City, where the victim lived. After defendant completed a batterer intervention program, the court released defendant on the conditional discharge. The court found that the imposed condition did not unlawfully impinge on defendant's constitutional right to travel. The restriction on travel was valid under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 65.10 as it ensured that defendant would be law-abiding and assisted defendant in his rehabilitation while taking into account defendant's concerns and also provided for the victim's safety under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 530.13. Additionally, defendant received the benefit of the bargain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court determined that the travel restriction imposed on defendant as a special condition of the conditional discharge and order of protection was lawful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Conditional Discharge -- Restricted Travel </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sentencing defendant, a Pennsylvania resident, to a one-year conditional discharge upon a criminal contempt conviction, the court did not deny defendant his constitutional right to travel by prohibiting him from entering New York City for three years unless the court lifted the restriction upon defendant's request due to an emergency. The fundamental right to travel is not absolute. Defendant, as a convicted criminal, did not possess an absolute right to travel. Under Penal Law &sect; 65.10 (1), a court may impose fundamentally rehabilitative conditions on a conditional discharge sentence reasonably necessary to ensure that defendant will lead a law-abiding life or to assist him to do so. The proscription on travel helped defendant adhere to the order of protection and lead a law-abiding life. It was fundamentally rehabilitative because the area defendant was not allowed to enter was reasonably related to where the offense occurred. Defendant was entitled to request relief from the restriction in an emergency. Further, CPL 530.13 permits a court to place additional conditions on a defendant served with a protective order which reasonably relate to protection of a victim. Here, the travel restrictions, as a specific condition of the protective order, ensured no contact. Finally, defendant agreed to the restriction on travel in exchange for a nonfelony conviction and nonprobationary sentence. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">One defendant sought outtakes from a documentary, and another defendant sought materials from an interview with a complainant in his case. Both sought these for possible impeachment material. The subpoenaed entities were not government agents and were covered by the N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 79-h privilege. Defendants had no constitutional right to the material. Neither defendant said they would seek to introduce evidence from the subpoenaed documents.

N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law art. 240 did not allow discovery from non-governmental agents. Witness statements possessed by civilian non-party individuals were not constitutionally required to be turned over to defendants.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner county social services department (department) filed a petition against respondent mother, alleging that she had neglected her three children by the infliction of excessive corporal punishment. The mother moved to dismiss certain allegations on the basis of res judicata or collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The current neglect petition was based on incidents occurring November 17, 2005, May 2, 2005, April 20, 2004, and January 27, 2004. The two 2004 incidents had already been the subject of a petition against the mother, which concluded with an Order of Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal (ACD) providing that the case was adjourned on specified terms and conditions, with a view to ultimate dismissal in the interests of justice. The department filed a petition alleging violation of the ACD, but an order of dismissal of the petition was signed and the dismissal was without prejudice. The court determined that the allegations regarding the two 2004 incidents were subject to dismissal because (1) the prior petition was dismissed in the interests of justice under Family Ct Act &sect; 1039(f) and could not be restored since the adjournment period expired and the time to restore the matter to the calendar had passed, and (2) the mother made an admission in the prosecution of the prior petition, but the department was not allowed to revisit the allegations in the prior petition. However, regarding the incident of May 2, 2005, the dismissal without prejudice had no preclusive effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants moved to dismiss the charges against them for parading without a permit and disorderly conduct, violations of New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 10-110(c) and N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.20(6); defendants claimed, inter alia, that the ordinance was facially insufficient and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants were arrested by the police for participating in a bicycle procession known as a Critical Mass. The court held that the city's parade permitting scheme, New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 10-110 and New York City, N.Y., R. tit. 38, &sect; 19-01 et seq., was overbroad and it was unconstitutional on its face. Although the city's parade permit scheme was a content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of the use of city streets, it gave no guidance as to the minimum number of persons that constituted a parade or procession requiring a permit. It vested unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or deny expressive activity. Another constitutional infirmity of the city's permit scheme was the absence of a requirement of mental culpability. Although defendants could not be found guilty of violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.20(6), because they were not ordered to disburse, they were participants in a group of at least 50 bicyclists that rode their bikes in a manner that obstructed the flow of vehicular traffic. Consequently, they were guilty of violating &sect; 240.20(5).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In defendants' criminal prosecution for parading without a permit in violation of New York City's parade permit scheme (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 10-110; 38 RCNY 19-02), the trial court was not bound under the law of the case doctrine by the ruling of the motion court on the ordinance's constitutionality. The motion court, in denying defendants' motion to dismiss the charges as constitutionally defective, found that the City's parade permit scheme was constitutional as an appropriate content-neutral regulation of the time, place and manner of all uses of the city streets by individuals moving along the roadway as a group on foot, bicycles, or in vehicles. However, the existence of exceptional circumstances warranted reconsideration of the constitutional issues raised by defendants. The trial court heard the testimony of numerous witnesses that highlighted deficiencies in the parade permit scheme. Furthermore, the motion court did not address the specific issues of whether the statute was overbroad for failing to adequately define what constitutes a parade or procession and providing no guidance as to what minimum number of participants may implicate the statute. Nor did the motion court address the potentially chilling effect upon freedom of expression inherent in a statute that purports to impose strict criminal liability upon persons who may join a procession without being aware that a required permit had not been issued.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Parading without Permit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Charges against defendants for parading without a permit in violation of New York City's parade permit scheme (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 10-110; 38 RCNY 19-02) stemming from their participation in a monthly &quot;Critical Mass&quot; spontaneous bike event involving over 50 bicyclists were dismissed as constitutionally defective. The otherwise content-neutral parade permit scheme, which requires a permit for &quot;any march, motorcade, caravan, promenade, foot or bicycle race, or similar event of any kind upon any street or roadway,&quot; is not narrowly tailored to meet the City's significant interest in keeping the streets open and available for movement, and is thus unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. The permit scheme gives no guidance as to the minimum number of persons that constitutes a parade or procession and otherwise vests the Police Commissioner with unfettered discretion to determine when any particular event may be found to fall within the amorphous definition of a parade or procession. Furthermore, a mental culpability requirement (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 15.15 [2]) must be read into the parade permit scheme in order to avoid the potentially chilling effect upon freedom of expression inherent in a statute that purports to impose strict criminal liability upon persons who may join a procession without being aware that a required permit had not been issued.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner business challenged the determination by respondent New York State Comptroller that the unclaimed amount of an expired gift certificate was abandoned property after five years despite the earlier expiration of the certificate, and that the business was required to report as abandoned property and pay over the entire unclaimed amount of the expired gift certificate notwithstanding any claim of profit from the sale of the certificate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The business argued that in making the determinations the Comptroller improperly interpreted N.Y. Aband. Prop. Law &sect; 1315 so as to disregard the business's legally binding gift certificate contract. The business also argued that the statute was interpreted in an unconstitutional manner in that the determination deprived the business of property without just compensation and without due process of law, and that N.Y. Aband. Prop. Law &sect; 1315 was unconstitutional on its face. The court ruled that the only interpretation that provided consistent meaning to both N.Y. Aband. Prop. Law &sect; 1315 and N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 396-i was the conclusion reached by the Comptroller that although gift certificates could expire, they were nonetheless deemed abandoned property after five years. The interpretation that the unredeemed value of gift certificates escheat to the State after five years even if the certificate had expired was consistent with the language of N.Y. Aband. Prop. Law &sect; 1315. Also, the business's claim that N.Y. Aband. Prop. Law &sect; 1315 was unconstitutional, or was interpreted in an unconstitutional manner by the Comptroller, was without merit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abandoned Property Law &sect; 1315, which provides that any unclaimed amount representing unredeemed gift certificates sold after December 31, 1983 and remaining unclaimed by the owner for five years shall be deemed abandoned property and paid to the State Comptroller, is not unconstitutional on its face or as applied to petitioner with respect to any of its unredeemed gift certificates that expired prior to the end of the five-year period. As Abandoned Property Law &sect; 1315 was in effect at the time petitioner was incorporated, it did not deprive petitioner of constitutionally protected rights to the benefit of its gift certificate contracts because those rights were subject to section 1315. Nor was petitioner deprived of private property without just compensation and without due process of law, as petitioner did not have a property interest in the unredeemed gift certificates because the statute declared that the value of those certificates escheated to the State.  </SPAN></P>

In examining the Michigan ordinance at issue in the Sixth Circuit case, the court found that that ordinance required speakers to apply for a permit 30 days in advance but New York City, N.Y., R. tit. 38, &sect; 19-04(c)(iv) and (v) permitted applications to be filed within 36 hours or less in exigent circumstances. A provision in the Michigan ordinance was overly broad in its definition of a special event while New York City, N.Y., R. tit. 38, &sect; 19-02(a) included specific examples of the type of events requiring a permit. The Michigan ordinance also differed because it contained a strict liability provision as opposed to the New York ordinance, which was only a violation and not a crime. Based on those critical distinctions, the court declined to reconsider its prior holding in Charity James.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants were lawfully charged with the violation of parading without a permit in violation of New York City's parade permit ordinance (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 10-110) stemming from their participation in a monthly &quot;Critical Mass&quot; spontaneous bike event in Manhattan. The ordinance, which requires a permit on at least 36 hours' prior notice for &quot;any march, motorcade, caravan, promenade, foot or bicycle race, or similar event of any kind upon any street or roadway&quot; (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;38 RCNY 19-02 [a]), is not unconstitutional on its face. The content-neutral ordinance, by including specific examples of the types of events requiring a permit, alleviates vagueness problems and provides sufficient protection against small groups of innocuous pedestrians or cyclists being targeted. The parade permit scheme was intended to encompass large events such as &quot;Critical Mass&quot; bike rides, whether such events are spontaneous or organized. Requiring permits for marches or parades proceeding on public rights-of-way constitutes a legitimate exercise of governmental authority.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant filed a motion for a jury trial in his criminal action, wherein he was charged with two Class B misdemeanors of attempted assault in the third degree, attempted criminal mischief in the fourth degree, as well as harassment in the second degree. His case had been transferred from the New York City Criminal Court, Bronx County, to the newly-formed court wherein the jury request was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A new criminal division of the court was established, pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, &sect; 142.2(b), and a number of cases, including the instant one, were transferred. The case was to be adjudicated pursuant to the same substantive and procedural law as it would have been in the originating court, pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, &sect; 142.3. The original charges against defendant, which included two Class A misdemeanors, were reduced to Class B misdemeanors, as well as a harassment violation. Upon the People's announcement of their readiness for trial, defendant filed a motion for a jury trial. The court found that the newly formed court was a &quot;superior court&quot; and as such, there was no jury trial right under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 340.40(2). Further, the transfer order was authorized by N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 30 because no rights of defendant were affected. Defendant was not entitled to a jury trial under U.S. Const. amend. VI, XIV, and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 only provided for jury trials for &quot;serious&quot; offenses. Also, there was no statutory authority under N.Y. Civ. Rights Law art. 2, &sect; 12 and no equal protection or home rule violation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, whose class B misdemeanor prosecution was transferred from the New York City Criminal Court, Bronx County, to the newly formed Criminal Division of the Supreme Court in Bronx County, was not entitled to a trial by jury. Supreme Court is a superior court, and CPL 340.40 (2), which requires that misdemeanor defendants tried in non-New York City local criminal courts be accorded jury trials, does not apply by its terms to the Supreme Court, Criminal Division, and cannot be a predicate for entitlement to a jury trial. Although the CPL is silent as to whether a defendant who is charged with a misdemeanor and prosecuted by way of a misdemeanor information in Supreme Court is to be tried by a jury or the court, a rule of the Chief Administrative Judge provides that every case transferred to the Criminal Division is to be adjudicated &quot;subject to the same substantive and procedural law as would have applied to it had it not been transferred.&quot; (22 NYCRR 142.3.) Had defendant, who was charged with two misdemeanors for which the authorized term of imprisonment was not more than six months, not been transferred to the Criminal Division, he would have been tried in a bench trial in the New York City Criminal Court pursuant to CPL 340.40 (2). </SPAN></P>

He was charged with two misdemeanors that carried a maximum penalty of three months' incarceration, and a defendant charged with offenses for which the maximum authorized term of imprisonment does not exceed six months is not entitled to a jury trial. The added possible penalty of a maximum $ 500 fine was not so grave as to elevate the offenses from the &quot;petty&quot; category to the &quot;serious&quot; category. </SPAN></P>

Statistics showing that a higher percentage of minorities reside in New York City than in other areas of the state did not prove that the denial of jury trials to defendants in New York City charged with petty crimes while affording jury trials outside of New York City for such crimes was discriminatory. Rather, bench trials were required for defendants in New York City charged with petty crimes in an effort to accommodate the unusually heavy demands of the New York City criminal justice system.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff prosecutor sought declaratory and injunctive relief, collaterally attacking a ruling by defendant criminal court judge dismissing drunk driving charges after excluding breathalyzer test results. The judge had held that establishing a foundation for the admissibility of such results by certifications of calibration and reference solution testing violated the Confrontation Clause, despite their characterization as business records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">State regulations required that breathalyzer machines be properly maintained and tested, and that reference solutions used in blood alcohol testing be double-checked with each use of the machines. These records of reliability had traditionally been admitted as business records under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 4518 to establish a foundation for the admission of breathalyzer results in drunk driving prosecutions. The judge had dismissed such a prosecution after holding the breathalyzer results inadmissible based on a further holding that the certifications were not admissible as business records because they had been prepared with an eye to use in future criminal trials and were therefore impermissibly testimonial. The court declared that admission of the documents for foundational purposes did not violate the Confrontation Clause. Breathalyzer testing did not always result in prosecutions. It often exonerated drivers. Therefore, the documents certifying their proper functioning were not prepared solely to aid in criminal prosecution, and were entirely admissible as business records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the request for injunctive relief. In a subsequent ruling, it entered summary judgment in favor of the prosecutor on his request for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Declaratory relief was available to the District Attorney to collaterally attack the ruling of a local criminal court that precluded the use of government-generated business records to establish the requisite foundation for the admission of breathalyzer test results in prosecutions for driving while intoxicated (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [2]) as being violative of the Confrontation Clause of the US Constitution. A declaratory judgment action was appropriate because the challenged ruling was likely to recur with similar results, and, if incorrect, could significantly obstruct the administration of justice. Moreover, no factual issues were required to be determined, and the action would not delay any pending criminal trial. Furthermore, no other remedy was available to the District Attorney, since an appeal from a trial order of dismissal resulting from the challenged ruling (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPL 450.20 [2]) would violate the constitutional protection against double jeopardy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right of Confrontation -- Admissibility of Breath Test Foundational Documents</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Government-generated documents pertaining to the servicing of a breath testing device and the State Police certification of the reference solution used to calibrate the device constitute nontestimonial business records that may be used to establish the requisite foundation for the admission of breathalyzer test results in a prosecution for driving while intoxicated (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [2]) without violating the Confrontation Clause of the US Constitution. The subject documents primarily serve legitimate business purposes and do not implicate core concerns of the Confrontation Clause, even if the documents have an incidental litigation purpose. Moreover, the records are neutral in character, relating only to the operation of the breath test instrument and the reference solution used to calibrate it. Furthermore, the admission of the documents would not establish any of the elements of driving while intoxicated. </SPAN></P>

Second, Albany, N.Y., City Zoning Ordinance &sect;&sect; 375-26(B)(1), 375-26(B)(2)(a) and 375-185 were also unconstitutional as applied to the instant application insofar as they required the issuance of a variance for the applicant's proposed educational use of the property and condition the issuance of such variance upon a showing of need or hardship. Further, the city failed to show a significant impact on traffic congestion, property values or municipal services, and had not overcome the presumption that a public school had a beneficial effect on the community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. City of Albany Zoning Ordinance &sect;&sect; 375-71 and 375-73, which do not list a school as an allowable principal, accessory or special permit use in C-1 (neighborhood commercial district) or C-2 (highway commercial district) districts, are unauthorized and therefore unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A determination of the Board of Zoning Appeals denying petitioners' application for variances and a parking lot permit to construct and operate a charter school on commercial property that previously had been used as an elementary school for over 70 years was arbitrary and capricious and not supported by competent evidence in the record. The property is located in a neighborhood comprised of diverse land uses, one block from a major thoroughfare lined with commercial establishments. The zoning ordinance restrictions of building height, front and rear yard setbacks, maximum lot coverage and parking were reasonably addressed in the proposal. Educational institutions are presumed to have a beneficial effect on a community, and zoning boards must make every effort to accommodate these uses. Respondents failed to overcome the presumption in that they presented no evidence of a significant impact on traffic congestion, property values or municipal services.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Pursuant to a plea agreement, a &quot;stay away&quot; permanent order of protection was entered against defendant, preventing him from having any contact with the victim. At the time of sentencing, defense counsel requested that the order of protection contain the specific addresses from which defendant was to stay away.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that in light of the fact that defendant and the victim were strangers, the failure to include the specific address information would violate defendant's due process rights. The court found that the plain language of the uniform form order of protection found in N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 530.13(1)(a) satisfied the Bright test, and thus did not violate defendant's due process rights. Under the statute, defendant would not violate the order unless he was aware that a particular location was barred to him. Including a victim's address information in a &quot;stay away&quot; order would thus add no permanent due process protection for defendant while confusing the function of the order, to protect a particular person, not the current or subsequent location of the person. Defendant's due process rights would be sufficiently protected and the intent of the statute would be better served if it was incumbent upon a defendant who inadvertently entered a location and recognized a protected party to leave that location. The court additionally found that a &quot;stay away&quot; order which did not include address information would not be unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nonfamily &quot;stay away&quot; permanent order of protection issued pursuant to CPL 530.13 in connection with defendant's negotiated plea to a disorderly conduct charge did not violate defendant's due process rights by failing to include the specific addresses of the protected party from which defendant was to stay away. The function of an order of protection is to protect a particular person, not the current or subsequent location of that person's home, school, business or place of employment. The order herein provided clear notice to defendant of the conduct that was prohibited, to stay away from the protected party wherever that party might be, and contained objective standards and guidelines to govern law enforcement. Inclusion of specific addresses in an order of protection would add no due process protection and would not account for the possibility that the protected party could move.  </SPAN></P>

I and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer was the chairperson of an alternative political party. He claimed that the NYCCFA impermissibly required taxpayers to fund political speech, in violation of their constitutional right to freedom of speech. Defendants asserted, among other claims, that the resident lacked standing to prosecute the suit. The court agreed. It was not clear what the nature of the speech that the taxpayer was objecting to was. He failed to show an &quot;injury in fact&quot; that he personally suffered, arising from the NYCCFA and its enforcement. The tax consequences arising from the NYCCRA was an injury suffered by all taxpayers. The taxpayer did not show that he had any special rights or interests in the matter. The compulsory funding of political speech did not fall within the zone of interests protected by the NYCCFA, which was designed to reduce political corruption and to provide voters with a greater selection of candidates. The taxpayer did not claim standing under General Municipal Law &sect; 51, which allowed taxpayers to seek injunctive relief in certain situations. That statute did not apply because the taxpayer did not allege any illegal acts of fraud, corruption, or bad faith.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of burglary in the third degree, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 140.20. The People served a persistent felony information upon the court and moved to have the defendant sentenced as a persistent felony offender pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.10. The court held a hearing to consider defendant's claims that the persistent felony offender was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the persistent felony offender (PFO) statute violated the Apprendi doctrine, which held that other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum had to be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge found that a recent New York case held that Apprendi was distinguishable from the PFO statute, because under New York's scheme, it was the mere fact of two or more prior convictions alone which determined eligibility for the higher sentence. The court was required to consider other enumerated factors to determine whether it was of the opinion that a PFO sentence was warranted, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.20(9). The court found that this action was only fulfilling the court's traditional role, giving due consideration to agreed-upon factors in determining an appropriate sentence within the permissible statutory range. The court found that it was constrained to find that the defendant's challenge to the PFO statute was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's persistent felony offender statute, which permits the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment authorized for a class A-I felony if the defendant has previously been convicted of two or more felonies (Penal Law &sect; 70.10), is not unconstitutional. The statutory scheme does not impermissibly permit an enhanced sentence based upon a fact which has not previously been submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, the prior felony convictions are the sole determinant of whether a defendant is subject to enhanced sentencing as a persistent felony offender. It is only after defendant's eligibility for persistent felony offender treatment is established by reason of the prior convictions that the sentencing court can consider other enumerated factors to determine whether persistent felony treatment is warranted (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPL 400.20 [9]). Furthermore, any such enhancing factors must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondents contended that the suit should be dismissed because the candidate had not filed objections with the BOE, which they argued was a prerequisite for filing the suit under Election Law &sect; 6-154(2). The candidate argued that a retracted portion of the nominating petitions, which struck out the statement that the witness was duly qualified to sign the petition, rendered the petitions invalid under Election Law &sect; 6-140. The court held that Election Law &sect; 6-154(2) did not apply because the nominating petitions were being challenged on their face and the candidate did not challenge the manner in which the opponent had obtained her candidacy to seek the party's nomination. It found that, pursuant to prior precedent that had held that a similar requirement in Election Law &sect; 6-132 was unconstitutional,&nbsp;Election Law &sect; 6-140's residency requirement was unconstitutional. It was not clear, however, that the statement was redacted from the petitions on that ground. The candidate had shown that the petitions did not facially comply with Election Law &sect; 6-140. Respondents did not show that the petitions, as redacted, substantially complied with the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff injured party and her spouse sued defendant tobacco companies for damages from smoking their cigarettes and for loss of consortium, due to negligent product design. The trial was divided into considering (1) the companies' liability for compensatory damages, (2) the companies' liability for punitive damages, and (3) the amount of punitive damages. The trial court ruled as follows on various motions in limine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Public awareness of smoking danger was barred unless the companies relied on public information to make product design decisions as all seven risk/utility factors, including awareness of a product's danger, did not have to be presented to a jury, and this factor was irrelevant to negligent product design. Primary assumption of the risk did not apply to cigarette smoking. Express assumption of the risk, based on cigarette package warnings, could only be claimed if the injured party was not addicted to smoking when the warnings were required. Federal conflict preemption did not bar negligent product design claims against the companies. The commercial viability of safer cigarettes was irrelevant to whether the safer design was feasible or functional. As alleged torts were directed by the companies' officers, the &quot;clear and convincing&quot; standard was inapplicable to proof of punitive damages. The companies' financial condition was relevant to the punitive damages amount. No such evidence was allowed until the trial phase at which this amount was considered, so such damages were not awarded based on the companies' wealth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The injured parties' motions to bar common knowledge evidence and dismiss primary assumption of the risk were granted, their motion to dismiss express assumption of the risk was denied, the companies' motion to dismiss was denied, evidence of a safer product's commercial viability was barred, the companies' motion for additional jury instructions was denied, and their motion to exclude evidence of their financial condition was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Products Liability--Defectively Designed Product--Cigarette Manufacturers--Admissibility of Evidence of General Public's Awareness of Dangers of Cigarette Smoking </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a products liability action based upon defendants' alleged negligent design of cigarettes that plaintiff smoked over a 46-year period, allegedly resulting in her development of lung cancer, defendants were precluded from introducing at the liability phase of the trial evidence of the general public's awareness of the dangers of cigarette smoking in the absence of evidence showing that they made product design decisions in reasonable reliance upon the information available to the public. Information generally known to the public concerning the condition of a product would be relevant in a strict products liability action in which the condition of the product itself, as it is offered in the marketplace, is the central issue. However, in a negligent product design action in which the manufacturer's knowledge of the condition of the product as designed and the manufacturer's conduct in light of that knowledge are the central issues, public awareness of the dangers of the product would only be relevant and admissible when evidence exists that the manufacturer of the product reasonably relied upon the public awareness when making design decisions concerning the product.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negligence--Assumption of Risk--Primary and Express Assumption of Risk--Defectively Designed Product--Dangers of Cigarette Smoking </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Defendant cigarette manufacturers were not entitled to assert the affirmative defense of primary assumption of the risk in a products liability action based upon their alleged negligent design of cigarettes that plaintiff smoked over a 46-year period, allegedly resulting in her development of lung cancer. The doctrine of primary assumption of the risk is limited to participation in recreational or sporting events where there is a commonly understood elevated risk of danger inherent in the activity. The doctrine is premised upon the concept that the participant in the activity is free to choose whether or not to do so. Consequently, the doctrine would not apply to cigarette smoking because of the smoker's claim of addiction. However, defendants could assert the affirmative defense of express assumption of the risk to the extent they could demonstrate that plaintiff was not addicted to smoking cigarettes prior to 1969 when labels warning of the dangers of cigarette smoking became mandatory.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States--Federal Preemption--Products Liability Action against Cigarette Manufacturers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Plaintiff's cause of action against defendant cigarette manufacturers for negligent product design was not barred by the doctrine of federal conflict preemption. Federal statutes regarding the labeling and marketing of tobacco products and the adverse consequences of tobacco use (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">15 USC &sect; 1331 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.) do not preclude negligent product design claims from being asserted against cigarette manufacturers under state law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Products Liability--Defectively Designed Product--Cigarette Manufacturers--Admissibility of Evidence of Commercial Viability of Safer Alternatively Designed Cigarettes </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. In a products liability action based upon defendants' alleged negligent design of cigarettes that plaintiff smoked over a 46-year period, allegedly resulting in her development of lung cancer, defendants were precluded from offering evidence concerning the commercial viability of safer, alternatively designed cigarettes to prove that a safer alternative design to the cigarettes they marketed was not feasible at the time plaintiff used their products. In a negligent product design action, the commercial viability of the proposed alternatively designed product is not relevant to the determination of whether the safer alternative design was feasible. In order to meet the burden of proving the feasibility of a safer alternative design, a plaintiff need only demonstrate the technological feasibility of the &quot;design,&quot; not its commercial viability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damages--Punitive Damages--Defectively Designed Product--Cigarette Manufacturers--Burden of Proof </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. In a products liability action against defendant cigarette manufacturers for negligent product design, defendants were not entitled to a jury instruction at the punitive damages phase of the trial that plaintiff's entitlement to punitive damages had to be established by &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidence. While a heightened &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidentiary standard for punitive damages might apply where liability was based on respondeat superior, the ordinary &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; was applicable in this negligent design case where plaintiff was not seeking to hold defendants liable for the tortious acts of their employees. Under New York law, a claim for punitive damages is &quot;inextricably linked&quot; to the underlying cause of action. Consequently, the level of proof necessary to establish punitive damages must be the same as the level required to establish the underlying claim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damages--Punitive Damages--Defectively Designed Product--Cigarette Manufacturers--Admissibility of Evidence of Defendants' Financial Condition </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a products liability action against defendant cigarette manufacturers for negligent product design, evidence of defendants' financial condition was admissible during the punitive damages phase of the trial. Any due process limitations placed on the size of punitive damages awards to prevent unconstitutionally excessive awards do not foreclose consideration of a defendant's financial status in determining the amount of a punitive damages award. A defendant's wealth is relevant to the amount of the punitive damages award in order to ensure that the award carries the proper punishment and deterrent effect.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, a group of newsstand owners and operators, brought suit against defendants, a city, the city's department of transportation, and various other city officials and agencies, seeking a preliminary injunction against defendants from implementing and enforcing New York City, N.Y., Loc. Laws No. 64 (2003), which replaced all existing city newsstands with a single franchisee. Defendants moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The franchise created by Local Law 64 caused the newsstands to become owned by a single franchisee, subject to rebuilding and maintenance at the franchisee's expense, with plaintiffs continuing to operate the stands as licensees. Plaintiffs asserted that Local Law 64 was overly broad and vague, would cause 64 of 281 newsstands to close, violated their free speech rights, and constituted a taking under N.Y. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8. The court disagreed and held that Local Law 64 provided reasonable and practical criteria as to location and building that were needed to promote public safety. The court further found that Local Law 64 was content neutral and that the siting requirements, including the American with Disabilities Act requirements, were narrowly drawn, rational, and objective regulations that reasonably balanced plaintiffs' rights to conduct business with a significant public interest. The court did find that plaintiffs sufficiently stated a claim to withstand summary judgment on the issue of whether a taking under N.Y. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8 occurred by implementation of Local Law 64.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, granted defendants' motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' siting requirements, advertising, fees for new licensee, and equal protection claims, but denied defendants' motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' taking claim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plaintiffs were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief on constitutional grounds preventing the City from implementing a 2003 local law that required replacement of all existing newsstands with new newsstands owned, constructed and maintained by a single franchisee, required that the new newsstands be designed and built in compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 USC &sect; 12131 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), and imposed siting and display space requirements for new licensees (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 20-241.1). Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the local law violated due process by giving city officials unfettered discretion to issue and revoke licenses based upon an unconstitutionally vague criterion of avoiding &quot;hazardous conditions.&quot; The provisions of the local law regarding &quot;hazardous conditions&quot; set forth reasonable and practical criteria consistent with the City's governmental obligation to provide for a safe urban environment. Furthermore, the siting requirements of the local law, including the amount of clear path around a newsstand, the rate of pedestrian flow at the location and compliance with ADA standards, did not impermissibly burden any cognizable First Amendment rights. The siting requirements, taken together with the ADA requirements, were narrowly drawn, rational, objective, content-neutral regulations that reasonably balanced the licensees' rights to conduct their businesses with a significant public interest. In addition, the provision of the local law requiring new licensees to pay the franchisee for the cost of construction of the newsstand did not impermissibly burden any First Amendment rights.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant moved for an order pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.20(1) setting aside his sentence on the ground that it was illegally imposed or otherwise invalid as a matter of law, or, in the alternative, granting him a resentencing hearing consistent with the current sentencing provisions of the recently enacted Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act, 2004 N.Y. Laws 738. This matter followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Under 2004 N.Y. Laws 738, &sect; 23 of the legislation at issue, the retroactive resentencing provisions applied only to those sentenced defendants who were convicted of an A-I drug offense and sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of at least 15 years to life. Defendant, as a sentenced A-II felony drug offender, was thus not eligible to be resentenced. But, he alleged that there was an unconstitutional disparity in the retroactive application of the new legislation. Hence, the court found that there was a rational basis permitting A-I drug offenders to be resentenced immediately, as: (1) the legislature believed that the long minimum sentences being served by A-I drug offenders were much harsher and more egregious than the sentences being served by A-II drug offenders; (2) allowing A-I felons to be resentenced intended to lessen any disparity in the treatment of defendants sentenced under the old law; and (3) the retroactive sentencing effected approximately four hundred inmates, whereas resentencing all lower level drug offenders could cause an undue burden on the court system. Second, the difference in the severity of the sentences justified the different treatment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disparity in the retroactive application of the Rockefeller Drug Law Reform Act (L 2004, ch 738), which denies retroactive resentencing for those currently serving sentences for class A-II drug felony convictions while allowing retroactive resentencing for those convicted of class A-I drug felonies, is not unconstitutional. The significant differences in the old sentencing structure, requiring a 15-year minimum sentence for A-I offenders as compared to a three-year minimum sentence for A-II offenders, provides a rational basis for the different treatment accorded to A-I and A-II offenders. By permitting immediate retroactive resentencing for A-I and not for A-II offenders, the Legislature intended to allow for the release of those drug offenders serving the harshest and longest minimum sentences. The Legislature also intended to lessen any disparity in the treatment of A-I offenders sentenced under the old law as opposed to the new law, and no significant disparity between the laws exists for A-II offenders. Moreover, the retroactive sentencing provision for A-I offenders affects only approximately 400 inmates, whereas resentencing all lower level drug offenders could cause an undue burden on the court system.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State sought to require defendant, who had been convicted of kidnapping, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 135.20, to register as a sex offender under New York's Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA), N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 168-a(2)(a). Defendant objected, arguing that the crime for which he was convicted had no sexual component.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1989, defendant pleaded guilty to kidnapping based on his role in forcing two members of a rival gang, males aged 15 and 16, into a car. The victims were taken away by other gang members and killed. Defendant was released from prison in 1991, and in 1996 he was notified that he was required to register as a sex offender based on his kidnapping conviction. He claimed that SORA violated his right to due process and equal protection as guaranteed to him by U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and N.Y. Const., art I, &sect;&sect; 6, 11. The court found that SORA did not implicate a fundamental right, thereby disagreeing in part with the decision in Bell, and applied the rational basis test. It found that the rational relation to a legitimate state interest in protecting children from sexual predators, which the statute possessed, evaporated where there was no sexual element to the crime. The court noted that there was a presumption of legitimacy in SORA's requirement that those convicted of certain kidnapping offenses register as sex offenders, but that the presumption could be rebutted where, as here, defendant could establish that there was no rational basis for application of the statute to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court ruled that defendant would not be subject to the classification and registration requirements of New York's Sex Offender Registration Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Claimant buyer filed a small claims action against defendant seller, alleging that the seller failed to disclose a leak in the premises the buyer purchased from the seller. The seller counterclaimed, alleging that the buyer's suit was frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The buyer argued that the air conditioning pipe had been cut and left to drain into the wall, causing water damage. The trial court held that because N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 461(5) excluded residential condominiums and cooperatives from the New York Property Condition Disclosure Act, N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 460 et seq., N.Y. Real Prop. Law art. 14 violated the Equal Protection Clause. The property was inspected by a structural engineer before the contract was executed. Although the engineer's report was not part of the record, the contract did not contain any amendments indicating that items needed to be repaired. The buyer did not discover the problem until seven months after the sale. There was no independent evidence that the defective condition was caused by the seller or that the condition existed prior to the seller's move. The buyer also did not discover the problem in a walk-through inspection. The buyer did not provide expert testimony as to the cause of the problem. Further, it would violate public policy to allow the buyer to recover as repairs were not made by a licensed home improvement contractor. Finally, the seller failed to show damages to support her counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The buyer's cause of action was dismissed. The seller's counterclaim was dismissed. The New York Property Condition Disclosure Act was declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The Property Condition Disclosure Act, which requires the seller in a &quot;residential real estate&quot; transaction to complete a property condition disclosure form prior to the execution of the contract of sale (Real Property Law &sect; 461 [5]), is unconstitutional as being violative of equal protection to the extent that the statute excludes condominium and cooperative transactions from its coverage.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Claimant in a smalls claim action was not entitled to recover the costs incurred in repairing water damage caused by an allegedly undisclosed leak in the condominium unit purchased from defendant. Claimant had a structural engineer inspect the premises before entering into the contract of sale and did a walk-through inspection before closing title. Claimant failed to produce any independent expert evidence that the defect in the air-conditioning system was caused by defendant or that defendant had either actual or constructive knowledge of the defective condition prior to the closing. In any event, since the repair work was not performed by a licensed home improvement contractor (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;General Business Law art 36-A; 6 RCNY 2-221 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), public policy precluded reimbursement of claimant for the repair work.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The defendant and the complainant were husband and wife engaged in a contested divorce proceeding. During the pendency of those proceedings, mutual orders of protection were issued by a family court. The marital residence was divided by the family court, reserving different living areas for each of the parties. Defendant allegedly called the complainant names and removed wires from a computer. The court found no allegation that defendant violated the territorial restrictions of the family court order of protection or physically attacked or threatened the complainant. Furthermore, there was no allegation of a course of conduct, but rather the complaint alleged only one incident. Because all of the conduct complained of occurred within the marital residence, it was private in nature. In addition, the conduct that occurred did not rise to the level of the harassment. Therefore, pursuant to CPL &sect; 170.30(1)(a)(f), 170.35(1)(a), (b), the allegations contained in the accusatory instrument charging defendant with contempt for violating the protective order under Penal Law &sect; 215 50(3) were facially insufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of burglary and, in addition, had two prior convictions for felony offenses. The people requested that the court sentence defendant as a persistent felony offender, Penal Law &sect; 70.10. Defendant opposed and argued that the court was precluded from sentencing him as such because the persistent felony offender statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A factual determination regarding the commission of the crime for which defendant had not been convicted, but which served as the basis for an enhanced sentence, had to be determined by jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 70.10, the instant court would not make additional factual determinations regarding the crime for which defendant was convicted. Rather, defendant, by his prior convictions, was eligible to be sentenced within the range of a persistent felony offender. Whether the court would impose such a sentence was an exercise of broad discretion based on traditional sentencing factors. Thus, the New York sentencing statute regarding a persistent felony offender did not violate United States Supreme Court holdings in Apprendi, Ring, and Blakely. Moreover, because the statute did not mandate that the court impose a persistent felony sentence, it did not violate Booker. In Booker, the Supreme Court held that a discretionary component of a sentence need not be determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the New York State persistent felony offender statute comported with recently established Supreme Court reasoning and precedent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, charged by information with various identity theft-related misdemeanors, moved to dismiss the charges after an administrative judge transferred the proceeding from the Criminal Court of the City of New York, arguing that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.05 deprived the supreme court of jurisdiction over misdemeanor prosecutions and that transfer of her cases violated her equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 210.05 required prosecutors to seek indictments before invoking the supreme court's jurisdiction in certain types of prosecutions. Based on both the plain language of the statute and its legislative history, it was clear that this provision was intended to prevent prosecutors from overreaching in their prosecutions, not to limit the general jurisdiction of the supreme court, guaranteed by N.Y. Const. art. VI and N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 140-b, in any way. The legislation establishing local criminal courts had likewise established only concurrent jurisdiction over certain matters but had not limited supreme court jurisdiction in any way. Therefore, there was no statutory impediment to an administrative order, aimed at relieving court congestion, transferring some misdemeanor prosecutions from the criminal court to the supreme court. Although African American and Hispanic defendants predominated in the county in question, that was not true of all the counties where experimental transfers were being made, so there was no showing of equal protection violations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no statutory or constitutional impediment to the transfer of misdemeanor charges against defendant from the lower criminal court to the newly-created Criminal Division of Supreme Court, Bronx County, pursuant to administrative order (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;22 NYCRR 142.3). Supreme Court has general trial jurisdiction over misdemeanor cases being prosecuted by information (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art VI, &sect; 7; CPL 10.20 [1]). CPL 210.05, which provides that the &quot;only methods of prosecuting an offense in a superior court are by indictment . . . or by superior court information,&quot; is a procedural statute directed to prosecutors that could not be interpreted to deprive Supreme Court of its historical and constitutional power to preside over misdemeanor cases. Furthermore, the transfer of the misdemeanor charges to Supreme Court did not violate defendant's equal protection rights in the absence of any allegation that the transfer order was done with a &quot;racially discriminatory purpose.&quot; </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In an underlying action, defendants sued plaintiffs, alleging that the payment by a county and a town for estate property was unlawful.

Eventually, defendants withdrew the action and were sanctioned. In the present case, the court determined that dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint was not warranted under CPLR 3211(a)(1) because the decision in the underlying action indicated that there was no basis for naming plaintiffs in the underlying action. Under CPLR 3211(a)(5), plaintiffs' action was not barred by stipulation, because defendants did not submit the agreement to the court. Under CPLR 3211(a)(7), plaintiffs sufficiently set forth an abuse of process cause of action based upon the allegations regarding the frivolous lawsuit. Under CPLR 3211(g), defendants did not demonstrate that the action or counterclaim was an action involving public petition and participation under Civil Rights Law &sect; 76-a(1)(a).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, an A-I felony, and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a B felony. The New York State Legislature passed the Drug Law Reform Act (DLRA). A potential plea bargain sought to have the court accept a plea to the B felony in satisfaction of the A-I felony and the minimum mandatory state prison sentence based upon the new DLRA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The People were willing to take the plea with a minimum sentence. The crimes that defendant was charged with were committed prior to the earliest effective date of the DLRA. The general rule was that nonprocedural statutes were not to be applied retroactively absent a manifest legislative intent to that effect. The reduction statute, DLRA &sect; 16, N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 220.10, was a procedural statute and did not specify whether it was intended to be retroactive. The sentencing statute, DLRA &sect; 36, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.70, on the other hand, was a substantive (nonprocedural) statute which specified that it was not retroactive to the January 13, 2005, effective date. The court found that the sentencing statute evinced in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.70 was not retroactive to crimes committed prior to the effective date of January 13, 2005, through the manifest intent of the plain language of DLRA &sect; 41(d-1) that it applied to crimes committed on or after the effective day. It was not the province of the trial judiciary to change the clear and unambiguous language of duly enacted law unless its application would have effected an unconstitutional, illegal, or harmful act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant could have pled to the B felony in satisfaction of the A-I felony.

While a nonprocedural statute reducing the punishment for a particular crime is generally retroactive absent evidence of legislative intent to the contrary, the DLRA clearly states that the new sentencing guidelines &quot;shall apply to crimes committed on or after the effective date&quot; (L 2004, ch 738, &sect; 41 [d-1]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants filed respective motions to dismiss the indictment against them and for disclosure of the grand jury minutes. One defendant filed a motion to inspect the grand jury minutes. Defendants were charged in a 22-count indictment with various counts and degrees of grand larceny by extortion, attempted grand larceny and extortion, coercion and attempted coercion, and conspiracy to commit those crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The charges against defendants arose out of the 2002 primary election campaigns of two judges. Defendants were the chairman and the executive director, respectively, of a county Democratic committee. The allegations were that defendants demanded that the candidates campaign jointly, use a vendor designated by them to produce and distribute campaign literature for at least three joint mailings, and pay a person designated by them to run campaign operations and, if they did not, defendants would cause the Democratic Party to withdraw its endorsement and/or support from the candidates. The court refused to dismiss the indictments, because the evidence was legally sufficient to establish that defendants threatened and conspired to threaten the candidates with conduct that would have damaged their campaigns. The evidence was also sufficient to show that defendants sought or obtained a financial benefit for themselves in the nature of a kickback from the campaign operations person they sought to force the candidates to use. The court also held N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 135.60, 155.05 were constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the motion of one defendant to inspect the grand jury minutes.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An indictment charging defendants, in their representative capacities as political party leaders, with larceny by extortion and coercion for having allegedly threatened to withdraw their party's previously given endorsements in the primary election from judicial candidates who did not use a designated vendor to produce and distribute campaign literature for joint mailings and to pay another designated person to run joint campaign &quot;operations&quot; was supported by legally sufficient evidence. The grand jury could have reasonably inferred from the timing of defendants' demands shortly before the primary election in the midst of the window of time when nominating signatures could be gathered that defendants exercised their power as party leaders in a coercive and improper manner that would not have materially benefitted the party (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 135.60 [9]; &sect; 155.05 [2] [e] [ix]). Moreover, the grand jury could have reasonably concluded that the party had no reason to demand that the judicial candidates use the designated vendor or suffer the loss of the party's endorsement or support.  </SPAN></P>

An indictment charging defendants, in their representative capacities as political party leaders, with larceny by extortion and coercion for having allegedly threatened to withdraw their party's previously given endorsements in the primary election from judicial candidates who did not use a designated vendor to produce and distribute campaign literature for joint mailings and to pay another designated person to run joint campaign &quot;operations&quot; was not subject to dismissal on constitutional grounds. The extortion and coercion statutes involved (Penal Law &sect; 135.60 [9]; &sect; 155.05 [2] [e] [ix]) are not violative of either the right to free speech or the right of association. The statutes focus on threats of damage made for no legitimate purpose that fall outside the realm of ordinary social or political conflict. Moreover, application of the statutes to defendants' conduct would not impermissibly interfere with the &quot;internal administration&quot; of their party's organization. Furthermore, the statutes are not impermissibly vague or overbroad as applied to the conduct with which defendants were charged. The threats defendants allegedly made did not embody either legitimate political decision making or a legitimate exercise of party discipline, and were not otherwise constitutionally protected expressions of ideas or advocacy.  </SPAN></P>

That doctrine is one of &quot;last resort&quot; and should only be invoked with regard to punishment for actions that are not plainly and unmistakably proscribed. Here, the extortion and coercion statutes involved (Penal Law &sect; 135.60 [9]; &sect; 155.05 [2] [e] [ix]) made reasonably clear to defendants at the relevant time that their alleged conduct was criminal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Movant, a witness, sought to have a grand jury subpoena issued to her quashed, or to be excused from testifying, based on her claim that she was the subject of a person in need of supervision (PINS) proceeding and a witness in a neglect proceeding, and that any testimony she gave might put her liberty at stake.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The witness contended that her testimony would presumably deal with the subject matter of the PINS and the neglect proceeding, which had not been resolved. Further, she claimed that if she was found to be a PINS, she faced placement in a non-secured detention facility, which would impair her liberty. The court determined that the application was made pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2304. The court noted that the witness would not be obligated to execute a waiver of immunity. The court found that the grant of transactional immunity conferred on the witness by N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 190.40 extended to the PINS proceeding. It also concluded that while the witness could be compelled to testify before the grand jury, she was to be accorded the protections under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 50.10. The court reviewed the history and purpose of the immunity, and noted that it was not limited to the prosecution of criminal offenses, but instead, applied to the witness's potential loss of liberty herein. Accordingly, she was not to be subjected to any family court proceeding in which her testimony would result in her loss of liberty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the witness's motion, but ordered that her testimony was entitled to statutory protections of immunity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The People had the authority pursuant to CPL 190.40 to compel a juvenile who is both the subject of a person in need of supervision (PINS) proceeding that could result in the loss of her liberty and a witness in a neglect proceeding to testify before the grand jury concerning unresolved Family Court matters. However, if the juvenile testifies before the grand jury without a waiver of immunity, she must be accorded full transactional immunity pursuant to CPL 50.10 that extends to the PINS proceeding. A PINS proceeding implicates a fundamental &quot;liberty interest&quot; in remaining free from detention and supervision restrictions and is thus covered by the immunity protections afforded by CPL 50.10.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff same-sex couples and nominal defendants, the city and its clerk, moved for summary judgment in the couples' action seeking a declaration that the New York's Domestic Relations Law was unconstitutionally denying the couples equal protection, substantive due process, and free speech. Defendant New York State Department of Health, which was responsible for issuance of marriage certificates, cross-moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The couples brought their action after the city clerk told them that under guidelines issued by the Department she could not issue marriage licenses to them. The court held, first, that the clerk and the city had no standing to appear in the action at all, since the clerk's only role in issuing the license was a ministerial one. On the merits, the couples failed to carry their burden to show unconstitutionality. Since sexual orientation was not a suspect classification, the Department only had to show a rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose, and as an appellate court in another division had found, the legislature was within its rights in deciding that promotion of traditional family life and procreation of children was an important purpose of marriage. There was also no violation of substantive due process, because the right to same-sex marriage had not been recognized as a fundamental right. Finally, there was no violation of the couples' free speech guarantees because they retained the right to express their commitment to each other in a ceremonial manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the Department's cross-motion, and entered summary judgment of dismissal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Same Sex Marriage -- Standing of Municipality to Challenge Constitutionality of State Marriage Laws </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a declaratory judgment action by same-sex couples seeking to obtain marriage licenses from the City Clerk of the City of Ithaca, defendant City lacked standing to interpose cross claims challenging the constitutionality of the state law limiting the issuance of marriage licenses to heterosexual couples. The duty of the City Clerk to issue marriage licenses to qualified applicants (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 15 [2]; &sect; 23) is ministerial and nondiscretionary. The Clerk's actions with respect to license applications and recording of information are governed solely by state law and are not in furtherance of any role as a representative or agency of the City. The City failed to establish that it had a justiciable stake in the outcome of the action or that it was aggrieved or even affected by the Department of Health's interpretation of the State's marriage laws as not authorizing the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Administrative Interpretation -- Same Sex Marriage -- Authority of Department of Health to Issue Advisory Letter </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The City Clerk of the City of Ithaca properly refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in reliance on an advisory letter from the New York State Department of Health indicating that such licenses were not authorized by state law. The Department acted within its authority in providing guidance to the City Clerk regarding the application of the State's marriage laws. The Department has authority to supervise the registration and recording of all marriages (Domestic Relations Law &sect; 23), and has unlimited authority to issue &quot;forms and instructions, interpretive statements and statements of general policy which in themselves have no legal effect but are merely explanatory&quot; (State Administrative Procedure Act &sect; 102 [2] [b] [iv]). The advisory letter was an accurate explanation of the law and was thus not subject to the rule-making process.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Marriage -- Same Sex Marriage -- Constitutionality of Limiting Issuance of Marriage Licenses to Heterosexual Couples </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. State law does not authorize the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The limitation of marriage licenses to heterosexual couples is not violative of the equal protection rights of same-sex couples under the rational basis standard. The sexual orientation-based license classification is rationally related to the legitimate state interest in preserving the historic institution of heterosexual marriage, which in turn uniquely fosters procreation and child-rearing. Similarly, the limitation of marriage licenses to opposite-sex couples is not violative of due process. The civil marriage of same-sex couples is not a fundamental constitutional right entitled to due process protection.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff opera association sued defendant technical systems company under N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 397 and sought summary judgment as to liability and a permanent injunction to prevent the company from using the association's name, and an inquest to determine the association's damages. The company cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and for leave to amend its answer to add affirmative defenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the trial court denied the parties' summary judgment motions, counsel agreed the fact question the court found was not an element of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 397 and only the statute's facial constitutionality, contested by the company, should be considered. The parties could not agree to have a court decide a constitutional question. While the truth or falsity of literature in which the company allegedly used the association's name without consent was no element of &sect; 397, the issue was whether, in analyzing &sect; 397's infringement of the company's commercial speech, this speech was misleading and not entitled to First Amendment protection. A dispute as to whether the literature was misleading had to be tried to decide if the statute was constitutional. If the speech was not protected by the First Amendment, the court could not decide the statute's constitutionality. The company's proposed amendments had no arguable merit. Equitable estoppel did not apply as N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 397 required written consent to use the association's name. The company did not show it no longer used the association's name, so mootness and/or futility were not defenses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action for injunctive relief and damages pursuant to General Business Law &sect; 397 based upon defendant's alleged unauthorized use of plaintiff nonprofit organization's name for defendant's own commercial purposes, the issue of whether the statute was facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment was not reached prior to resolution of the disputed factual issue of whether defendant's commercial speech was misleading, regardless of the stipulation of the parties to have the court decide the constitutional issue. Plaintiff, a world renowned opera company, challenged the claim made in defendant's advertising brochure and on its Web site that defendant's patented simultaneous opera translation system was installed at plaintiff's opera house. Plaintiff alleged that it developed and used its own simultaneous translation system. If it is determined that defendant's brochure and Web site were misleading, defendant's commercial speech would not be protected by the First Amendment, and there would thus be no need to reach the constitutional issue. A court should not reach a constitutional challenge before it is necessary to do so, and the parties cannot consent to bind a court to determine a constitutional issue. </SPAN></P>

No binding precedent resolved the constitutionality of prohibiting such marriages. The personal autonomy to decide who one would marry was within the right to privacy. Excluding same-sex couples from civil marriage infringed on that fundamental right and served no compelling state interest. Moral disapproval of same-sex couples was not a legitimate state purpose or rational reason to infringe that right. The state could not deprive this right because other states and the federal government did. Denying the freedom to choose one's spouse to one who wished to marry a person of the same sex denied the fundamental right to marry. Excluding the couples from civil marriage discriminated against them based on sexual orientation, which could not be a basis for denying equal protection. It rationally served no legitimate state purpose. To cure the constitutional defect in the New York Domestic Relations Law, &quot;husband,&quot; &quot;wife,&quot; &quot;groom&quot; and &quot;bride&quot; were construed to mean &quot;spouse,&quot; and all personal pronouns were construed to apply equally to either men or women.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Marriage -- Same Sex Marriage -- Constitutionality of Marriage Laws</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York's marriage laws are unconstitutional under the State Constitution to the extent that they deny marriage licenses and access to civil marriage to same-sex couples such as plaintiffs (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect;&sect; 12, 15). The right to choose one's spouse is fundamental to the State's constitutional right of privacy (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;NY Const, art I, &sect; 6). The restriction of civil marriage to only opposite-sex couples violates fundamental due process protections under the strict scrutiny standard. Defendant City of New York failed to demonstrate &quot;a compelling state interest&quot; for the exclusion of same-sex couples from eligibility for civil marriage. Fostering the traditional institution of marriage and avoiding the problems that might arise from a refusal by other jurisdictions to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages did not constitute the requisite &quot;compelling state interest&quot; necessary to sustain the marriage classification. The State's restriction on same-sex marriage also violates equal protection. Sexual orientation cannot be used as a basis for denying any person the equal protection of the law. In order to cure the constitutional defect in the marriage laws, the words &quot;husband,&quot; &quot;wife,&quot; &quot;groom&quot; and &quot;bride,&quot; as they appear in the relevant sections of the Domestic Relations Law, should be construed to mean &quot;spouse,&quot; and all relevant personal pronouns should be construed to apply equally to either men or women.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the information was facially insufficient. The trial court held that the disorderly conduct charge was sufficiently pled. The information alleged that the deponent observed defendant behind a police barricade with over 100 other individuals, that the conduct caused a public inconvenience by obstructing traffic, that defendant intended to cause a public inconvenience, and that the conduct recklessly created a risk of public inconvenience. The information also sufficiently charged a parading without a permit violation. The deponent observed defendant walking with over 100 other individuals on a public street. Neither the deponent nor defendant had a written permit authorizing a parade. The non-hearsay element was met in both instances as deponent observed defendant's conduct and signed the information. Finally, defendant's prior restraint challenge to New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 10-110 failed as, when read in conjunction with New York City, N.Y., R. tit. 38, &sect;&nbsp;19-04, the ordinance was content neutral and specified the reasons a permit could be denied, required explanations for a denial, and placed time limits on the processing of applications.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An accusatory instrument charging defendant with disorderly conduct (Penal Law &sect; 240.20 [5]) and parading without a permit (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 10-110) arising out of her alleged participation in unlawful protest demonstrations with a large group of persons was facially sufficient. The factual allegations that defendant caused a public inconvenience by obstructing pedestrian and vehicular traffic and lacked a required permit were based upon the arresting officer's observations of defendant's conduct, and were thus sufficient to establish reasonable cause to believe that defendant committed both offenses.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Parading without Permit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A content-neutral municipal ordinance that proscribes parading without a permit (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 10-110) is not invalid as constituting an impermissible prior restraint on constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and assembly when read in conjunction with the administrative rules governing the permit application process (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;38 RCNY 19-04). The rules comport with constitutional requirements by plainly indicating the permissible grounds for permit denial, requiring explanations for denial and placing time limits on the processing of permit applications. Consequently, defendant could lawfully be prosecuted for parading without a permit based upon her alleged participation in unlawful protest demonstrations during the 2004 Republican National Convention.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Long after the Court of Appeals of New York had denied leave to appeal a judgment convicting defendant of first-degree manslaughter as a juvenile offender, defendant moved to vacate the judgment of conviction pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10 on grounds that admission of certain evidence at his trial violated his right to confrontation, as articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Crawford v. Washington.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At defendant's trial, the court had scrupulously applied the then-applicable Roberts test and determined that a co-defendant's testimony at her own plea allocution was admissible as a statement against penal interest with sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to allow the jury to consider it. Under the rule announced years later in Crawford, that evidence would not have been admissible because the co-defendant had not been subject to cross-examination. Defendant argued that even though his conviction was final, he could collaterally attack it as obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. The court determined that although the confrontation right was fundamental, Crawford simply prescribed a new, preferable method of effectuating it, so it was procedural rather than substantive. Procedural rules only applied retroactively where a watershed right was involved and where the failure to apply the new rule seriously diminished the likelihood of an accurate judgment. There was no basis whatsoever for arguing that the admission of the co-defendant's evidence, after the original court's searching inquiry, had affected the accuracy of the outcome, so there was no retroactivity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the motion to vacate in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right of Confrontation -- Retroactive Application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c12">Crawford</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Rule on Collateral Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was not entitled to the vacatur of his 1999 manslaughter conviction pursuant to CPL 440.10 on the ground that the introduction of his codefendant's plea allocution on the prosecution's direct case as a declaration against penal interest hearsay exception violated defendant's right of confrontation under the rule enunciated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Crawford v Washington</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177 [2004]). Defendant's conviction became final on direct review prior to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Crawford</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Crawford</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rule, which altered the manner in which the admissibility of testimonial statements is to be determined when the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial, constitutes a new procedural rule that does not apply retroactively on collateral review to cases already final on direct review. Collateral retroactive application of a new constitutional criminal procedural rule is not required unless following the invalidated former rule would have seriously diminished the likelihood of an accurate conviction. Here, the admission of the codefendant's plea allocution did not result in an impermissibly large risk that defendant was wrongfully convicted. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The complaint charging defendant with misdemeanors was deemed an information at arraignment, transferred to the criminal court, and transferred to the newly-created criminal division of the supreme court pursuant to a rule of the chief administrator, which was promulgated by the administrative judge. The court concluded that pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 10.20, 10.30, and 210.05, the case was improperly before the supreme court and should have been returned to the assigning court for disposition. The court held that while the administrative judge had the general power to restructure the county court system, it could not deviate from the legislature's clear intent in delineating the roles of the criminal and supreme courts. The court held that it could not construe N.Y. Crim. Proc.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supreme Court lacked trial jurisdiction over misdemeanor charges that had been transferred from the local criminal court to the newly-created Criminal Division of Bronx County Supreme Court pursuant to the court rule promulgated on September 21, 2004 (22 NYCRR part 142). Pursuant to that rule, after November 5, 2004 all felony and misdemeanor cases in the Criminal Court of Bronx County were transferred to the Criminal Division of Bronx County Supreme Court. However, notwithstanding that rule, CPL 10.20, 10.30 and 210.05 bar Supreme Court from trying an offense that has not been presented to it in the form of an indictment or superior court information. Those statutes do not place unconstitutional limitations on the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Rather, the statutory scheme merely regulates the manner of prosecuting misdemeanor and petty offenses before the Supreme Court and should be construed as being part of a legitimate legislative plan to delineate the functions of the constitutionally created New York City Criminal Court and to reconcile its operation with the constitutionally mandated jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.  </SPAN></P>

Consequently, the probationary sentence was legal and not subject to vacatur under CPL 440.20. The failure to provide defendant with any jail time credit against his probationary sentence did not render the statutory scheme unconstitutional as applied in view of the substantive differences between a probationary sentence and a sentence of imprisonment. The primary purpose of a probation sentence is to restore offenders to society and assist them to function productively, while the function of a sentence of incarceration is to punish and remove offenders from society. Since defendant needed counseling and supervision, a probationary sentence was necessary for his future well-being. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The father argued that &sect;&nbsp;111(1)(d) was unconstitutional as applied to him. The trial court held that while the father's name was not on any of the birth certificates, he had obtained orders of filiation for the four eldest children. The father was involved with the four older children's daily care, even before he obtained custody. The children were in the father's sole custody for 11 months. When custody was transferred to the grandmother, the father was granted visitation rights. He had telephone contact with his children while he was in prison and visited them after his release. To impose the requirements in &sect;&nbsp;111(1)(d) to the father would constitute the denial of equal protection based on sex and marital status. Section 111(1)(d) was unconstitutional as applied to the father and his four older children. The father's relationship with a fifth child was not so substantial as to create parental rights. The father might lose his parental rights if the agency proved that he had abandoned or permanently neglected the children, but the burden was on the agency to prove a basis for terminating the father's rights.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a proceeding to terminate respondent father's parental rights to his four out-of-wedlock children (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Social Services Law &sect; 384-b), respondent demonstrated that Domestic Relations Law &sect; 111 (1) (d), which sets forth the criteria necessary for an unwed father's consent to be required for the adoption of his children, is unconstitutional as applied to him to the extent that the statute would only entitle him to notice and an opportunity to be heard as to the best interests of the children. Respondent, who obtained orders of filiation for his children and had sole custody of them prior to his incarceration from 1998 to 2003, did not satisfy the statutory requirements for a &quot;consent father&quot; of providing financial support and either visiting or communicating with the children on a regular basis. However, respondent otherwise demonstrated a relationship with his children that was sufficiently &quot;substantial&quot; or &quot;significant&quot; to merit constitutional protection of his rights. Granting the right to consent to married fathers without having to demonstrate a &quot;substantial&quot; or &quot;significant&quot; relationship to their children, while imposing such a requirement on unwed fathers, discriminates against men who cannot unilaterally change their married/unmarried status, and constitutes the denial of equal protection based on sex and marital status. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent father moved to dismiss petitioner mother's custody action; the father claimed, inter alia, that the provisions of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mother was a United States citizen, and the father was a German citizen. The older child had lived in New York for one year, and the younger child was born in New York and had lived there his entire life. The father was personally served in New York. Although a divorce action had been filed in Germany, it was filed a month after the mother's custody petition. The court held that New York was clearly the home state of the children. Because the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 76, applied fully to international cases, New York had subject matter jurisdiction. The father was not enticed into the jurisdiction by fraud and deceit for the purpose of obtaining service upon him. The father had actual notice of the proceedings and would have an opportunity to be heard. Consequently, no procedural due process claim existed. No substantive due process claim existed either because the UCCJEA rationally and neutrally determined which forum was most appropriate to hear the custody issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a custody proceeding, Family Court obtained personal jurisdiction over respondent father, a resident of Germany, by petitioner mother's personal service upon him in New York while he was in this state on business and to visit his children. New York, as the &quot;home state&quot; of the parties' two children, had subject matter jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) to make an initial custody decision (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect; 76 [1]). Furthermore, the UCCJEA, was not unconstitutional as applied to respondent. The exercise of jurisdiction would not deprive respondent of his parental rights without due process. Respondent had actual notice of the proceeding and will have an opportunity to be heard. If respondent chooses not to come to New York, due process would not be offended by requiring him to proceed in accordance with the UCCJEA by either appearing through his attorney and testifying telephonically or by audiovisual means, or by testifying in a German court and having the transcript forwarded to Family Court (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect;&sect; 75-j, 75-k).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner mother sought to be appointed under N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act art. 17-A as guardian of her mentally retarded adult daughter. Respondent activist entity objected to the appointment of the mother to the extent that the guardianship included the authority under the 2002 New York Health Care Decisions Act for Persons with Mental Retardation (HCDA), N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act Law &sect; 1750-b, to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After the court determined that the daughter was incapable of making her own health care decisions, the entity alleged that the HCDA was unconstitutional. The court held that because N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act Law &sect; 1750(2) required the court to determine the daughter's incapacity to make health care decisions before appointing a guardian, and because the court held a hearing, the HCDA did not violate due process. Because the daughter did not understand the nature and consequences of end-of-life decisions, the HCDA did not violate her equal protection rights by not allowing her to make her own irrational health care or end-of-life decisions although persons capable of understanding such decisions had a right to make irrational decisions. Because N.Y. Surr. Ct. Proc. Act Law &sect; 1750-b(4)(b)(ii) imposed an &quot;extraordinary burden&quot; standard on a guardian before life support could be withdrawn, and because a guardian had other statutory duties, the HCDA was not unconstitutionally vague. Because the daughter was incompetent, did not lodge a competent objection to the appointment of a guardian, and trusted her mother, the mother was entitled to be appointed guardian in all respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the mother's petition for guardianship in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCPA 1750-b, which authorizes the guardian for a mentally retarded person to make &quot;any and all&quot; health care decisions for such person, including decisions to withhold and withdraw life-sustaining treatment, is not violative of due process or otherwise unconstitutional. Under the statute, a finding by the court of incapacity to make health decisions is a condition precedent to granting a guardian authority to make those decisions on behalf of a mentally retarded person. The test imposed by the statute in determining incapacity--whether a mentally retarded person facing end-of-life decisions is capable of understanding the medical choices available and the potential consequences of the decisions made--does not violate equal protection principles. The court's authority to deny the appointment of a guardian and the statutory standard to which the court is held in making the appointment offer sufficient due process protection to an incapacitated objecting ward. Furthermore, the statute's standard for the termination of life support is not unconstitutionally vague. The statute requires the guardian to make a thorough analysis of all aspects of the patient's medical condition, prognosis and expressed wishes before permitting the rejection of life-sustaining treatment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent village made a motion, pursuant to CPLR &sect; 7804(f), for an order dismissing a CPLR art. 78 petition filed by petitioner, a former chief of police, seeking separation pay pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 207-m and seeking damages for violation of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983 and 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The chief notified the village of his intention to retire on January 30, 2004. Prior to his retirement, the chief requested separation pay for 120 days of unused sick time, 2 weeks of unused vacation time, and 471 hours of compensation time earned before his promotion to chief; no separation pay was given to the chief. The court granted the motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part. The benefits at issue were not specifically referred to in &sect; 207-m and had not been specifically excluded from consideration as salary or other compensation; thus, the chief could pursue his claim as the benefits sought fell within the expansive definition of other compensation. The benefits had been earned during the course of the chief's employment and had been afforded to the chief's subordinates and his predecessor. However, the chief failed to establish a substantive due process violation as while he had a cognizable property interest under &sect; 207-m, the village's conduct was not so egregious as to implicate constitutional law as it was arguable as to whether the subject benefits fell within the scope of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied the village's motion to dismiss the chief's claim under &sect; 207-m but granted the motion to dismiss as to the &sect; 1983 claim of denial of due process. The court also granted the motion to dismiss as to the &sect; 1983 claim of denial of equal protection rights but did so without prejudice to service of an amended petition setting forth factual allegations supporting that claim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Accrued unused compensatory, vacation and sick time earned by a retiring police chief when he was a patrolman and sergeant in a collective bargaining unit, and unused vacation time earned as chief, were benefits within the expansive definition of &quot;other compensation&quot; contained in General Municipal Law &sect; 207-m, which was enacted to prevent salary &quot;compression&quot; between the heads of police departments and certain of their subordinates who were members of collective bargaining units. &quot;Other compensation&quot; is defined by way of a noninclusive list of benefits encompassing most employer fringe benefits; other benefits such as overtime, holiday and shift differential pay are specifically excluded unless a municipality affirmatively elects to include them within a police chief's employment benefit package. The fact that the benefits in question were earned prior to the chief's promotion or that such benefits afforded his subordinates were not increased following the promotion did not exclude them from the ambit of the statute. Excluding such benefits would be contrary to the purpose of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A village police chief seeking separation pay based on accrued unused compensatory, vacation and sick time earned while a patrolman and sergeant in a collective bargaining unit had standing to assert a claim under General Municipal Law &sect; 207-m, which was enacted to prevent salary &quot;compression&quot; between the heads of police departments and certain of their subordinates who were members of collective bargaining units. The provisions of the statute were applicable to the chief's claim and it was undisputed that petitioner held the position of Chief of Police at the time of his retirement. Accordingly, he qualified as a member of the class specifically protected by the statute and was entitled to seek redress thereunder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A proceeding brought by a retiring village police chief seeking separation pay based on accrued unused compensatory, vacation and sick time earned prior to his promotion to chief was not barred by the applicable four-month statute of limitations under CPLR 217, since the chief's claim for his retirement/separation package benefits did not accrue until such time as he was denied such benefits. Petitioner retired in January 2004 and did not receive written confirmation from the respondent that his request for separation pay had been rejected until February 5, 2004. Even if January 7, 2004, the date the petitioner first received written notice from the respondent of a reduced separation package, were deemed the date of accrual, the commencement of the proceeding on May 3, 2004 was timely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Due Process of Law -- Police Chief's Claim for Separation Pay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A municipality's denial of its retiring police chief's request for certain separation pay based on accrued unused compensatory, vacation and sick time earned prior to his promotion to chief did not constitute an unconstitutional violation of the chief's substantive due process rights. Although the chief had a cognizable property interest in his separation pay, he failed to demonstrate that the municipality's action was wholly without legal justification, since the subject of the chief's claim was not specifically referred to or identified by General Municipal Law &sect; 207-m, upon which the chief's right to his separation pay arose. It was arguable whether the claimed benefits fell within the scope of the statute. Therefore, the municipality's conduct was not so egregious as to implicate constitutional law. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant walked into traffic on the inner loop of an exit ramp and solicited money from motorists. He was charged with violating &sect; 44-4-H, and he sought dismissal, claiming that the ordinance was unconstitutional as violative of U.S. Const. amend. I and N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court initially determined that defendant had direct and vicarious standing to raise the constitutional challenges. The court held that &sect; 44-4-H was unconstitutional, in that it was not narrowly tailored to serve the significant government interest of promoting the safety and convenience of its citizens on public streets. Rather, the ordinance allowed for the prosecution of those who were guilty of passive solicitation, such as peacefully asking for assistance.

The ordinance, although content-neutral, was not &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; to achieve the governmental purpose of promoting the safety of motorists and pedestrians using public streets and highways. By prohibiting passive solicitations from the sidewalk, the ordinance had a chilling effect on expressive behavior that was not directed toward motorists and also impermissibly threatened individuals engaged in nondisruptive solicitation with the possibility of incarceration.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff Mayor of the City of New York filed a motion for summary judgment in the Mayor's action that sought a declaration that New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 6-124 was invalid. Defendant Council of the City of New York filed a cross motion for summary judgment, seeking dismissal of the Mayor's complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 6-124, enacted by the Council without a referendum, sought to prevent the City of New York from purchasing uniforms manufactured in sweatshops, either in New York, or in other states or countries. To that end, &sect; 6-124 barred the City's contracting agencies from purchasing apparel or textiles from any entity other than a responsible manufacturer. When presented with information indicating that a contractor or subcontractor was violating the law, the New York City Comptroller had to determine whether there was a violation. Upon finding a violation, the Comptroller had to present evidence of the violation to the contracting agency, which then had to take appropriate action. The New York City Mayor's authority over the award of City of New York contracts, New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 335, was almost exclusive. Because New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 6-124 gave the Comptroller the authority to award contracts that previously resided with the Mayor, New York City, N.Y., Charter &sect; 38(5) and N.Y. Mun. Home Rule Law &sect; 23(2)(f) required New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 6-124 to be submitted for a referendum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A local law of the City of New York that barred the City's contracting agencies from purchasing apparel or textiles from any entity other than a &quot;responsible manufacturer&quot; in order to prevent the City from purchasing uniforms manufactured in sweatshops (Administrative Code of City of NY &sect; 6-124), was invalid in the absence of a referendum of the City's voters because it impermissibly curtailed the Mayor's executive authority over the award of city contracts (Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 23 [2] [f]; New York City Charter &sect;&sect; 38, 335). The local law adopted a different definition of &quot;responsible&quot; from that intended by the City Charter and generally accepted in municipal contract law. The local law thus violated the separation of powers doctrine by impermissibly encroaching on the Mayor's function and the discretion of the municipal agencies vested with the duty to determine whether a bidder is &quot;responsible.&quot; </SPAN></P>

The state law imposes conditions on prospective vendors for participating in state contracts. The statute affords municipalities the option of either adopting the state requirements in their own bid specifications for the purchase of garments or textiles or having no requirements. The state law explicitly supercedes any inconsistent local laws (State Finance Law &sect;162 [9]), and thus leaves no room for alternative requirements in local bid specifications. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that the Grand Jury was inconsistent because the People presented it with the option of indicting him on the lesser included charges that contained the same elements as robbery in the first degree, but the Grand Jury indicted him only upon robbery in the first degree. Defendant contended that the rules regarding repugnant verdicts at trial were to apply to the Grand Jury. The trial court stated that if this was a petit jury, this inconsistency would have been grounds for setting aside the verdict. However, the laws governing the functions and duties of the Grand Jury and the petit jury were necessarily different. What appeared to be a repugnancy at the indictment stage could simply have been a permissible decision that the Grand Jury made, for whatever reason, including the exercise of leniency, to indict on only one count.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An indictment in which the grand jury found sufficient evidence for the charge of robbery in the first degree, but did not indict defendant on lesser included charges that contained the same elements, was not subject to dismissal under the doctrine of repugnancy. The rules regarding repugnant verdicts at trial do not apply to the grand jury, whose function is different than that of a petit jury. A grand jury, whose purpose is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to establish the material elements of a crime, has discretion to indict for one crime, but not for a lesser included charge.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff vehicle owner sued defendant county and its police department for seizing and retaining his vehicle pursuant to a county ordinance which was found to be unconstitutional. The owner moved to amend his notice of claim pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 50-e(6), and the county cross-moved to dismiss the notice of claim pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 50-e(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ordinance under which the vehicle was seized was held unconstitutional. His claim did not arise when the vehicle was seized as the ordinance then precluded recovery. It was unreasonable to make the owner immediately challenge the ordinance's constitutionality or lose any recovery. The ordinance was void ab initio, so the seizure and retention were unlawful when committed. The claim's accrual was delayed, as the owner's right to sue depended on the jural event of an appellate court finding the ordinance unconstitutional. His claim had to be filed within 90 days of that decision, notwithstanding an appeal, but the ordinance's uncertain status, given the county's appeal, and a question as to when his claim arose, gave a reasonable excuse for the claim's delay. The county knew the claim's facts, and was no more prejudiced than it would have been had the claim been timely. The owner's proposed amendment corrected no mistake, but sought different damages, requiring different evidence, and substantially altered the claim by stating theories of which the county had no adequate notice. The proposed amendment was prejudicial and outside the purview of N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 50-e(6).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner's motion to amend his notice of claim was denied, and the county's motion to dismiss the notice of claim was denied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action by plaintiff seeking recovery for property damage and costs incurred as a result of defendant County's seizure and retention of plaintiff's vehicle pursuant to a county forfeiture ordinance, defendant was not entitled to a dismissal, pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e (1) (a), of plaintiff's untimely notice of claim, filed almost 5 years after the seizure, 11 months after an Appellate Division decision declaring the ordinance unconstitutional, and almost 3 months after the Court of Appeals affirmance of that decision. A claim based on the unlawful infringement of an individual right by a government entity acting under color of law accrues when it is judicially determined that the law is invalid. Here, the claim accrued upon the determination by the Appellate Division that the law was invalid, despite the appeal of that decision. Although the notice of claim was untimely, a late notice of claim was allowed pursuant to General Municipal Law &sect; 50-e (5). The uncertain status of the ordinance constituted a reasonable excuse for the eight-month delay, and the defendant, having custody of the vehicle, had knowledge of the facts constituting plaintiff's claim and was not prejudiced by the delay.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A committee had been formed to receive contributions and make expenditures on behalf of defendant's re-election campaign. The grand jury evidence established that defendant came into possession of a check in the amount of $ 5,000 and payable to the committee, but that defendant deposited the check in his personal checking account. The court first held that because the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant stole the check from the committee, it was also legally sufficient to establish that he failed to report it to the treasurer, caused her to fail to report it to the Board of Elections, and converted its proceeds to his unlawful personal use, acting &quot;knowingly and willfully.&quot; In addition, defendant failed to show prosecutorial abuse for refusal to grant immunity to defendant's witness. However, the indictment failed to adequately allege that defendant acted &quot;knowingly and willfully&quot; under N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 14-126 and, thus, was insufficient with respect to the counts alleging violations of the Election Laws. And, finally, the court held that the interests of justice did not require dismissal of the indictment under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 210.40.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the landlord proved a prima facie case that there was drug-related criminal activity at the premises. The tenant was bound by her lease. Her tenancy was subject to the &quot;no-fault&quot; standard of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1437d(l)(6).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was indicted on five counts related to attempts and the actual dissemination of indecent material to minors. Defendant filed various pre-trial motions, including dismissal of the indictment, a motion for a bill of particulars, motion for discovery, motion for suppression of statements, inspection and release of grand jury minutes, a Sandoval hearing, and a reservation of rights for further motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the four counts of attempted dissemination of indecent material to minors needed to be dismissed because the elements of the crime as set forth under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.22 required the transmittal of &quot;depictions.&quot; Defendant contended that the use of the word &quot;depict&quot; in the statute required the transmittal of a pictorial image and not just words, as allegedly used by defendant. The court held that conversation alone, which described sexual conduct, was sufficient to allege a prohibition of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 235.22. Section 235.22 clearly put an offender on notice that sexually oriented computer communication with a minor for the purpose of inducing or inviting that child to engage in sexual conduct with an adult was prohibited. Defendant's motion for a bill of particulars was denied because it did not comply with the procedure set forth in N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 240.40. There were no statements made by defendant that the state intended to use at trial, and no hearing on the motion to suppress was warranted. The grand jury proceedings were not defective, and there were no grounds for releasing the minutes to defendant, based on the court's in camera review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment, denied the motion for a bill of particulars, denied the motion for discovery, denied the motion to suppress statements, denied the motion for release of the grand jury proceedings, outlined the procedures needed for a Sandoval hearing, denied the motion for a hearing request on the arrest, and granted the motion for a hearing on the search of the home.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, who allegedly had sexually explicit conversations with an undercover police officer posing as a 14-year-old boy via computer messages, was not entitled to a dismissal of the counts of the indictment charging him with attempted dissemination of indecent material to a minor in the first degree in violation of Penal Law &sect; 235.22 merely because the communications did not include pictorial images of sexual conduct. Penal Law &sect; 235.22 prohibits the use of a computer to engage a minor in communication that depicts actual or simulated nudity, sexual conduct or sadomasochistic abuse with the intent to invite or induce such minor to engage in sexual contact with the offender. The word &quot;depict,&quot; as used in the statute, is not limited to visual images, but rather includes words that describe sexual conduct. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, five enrolled voters, filed a special proceeding pursuant to N.Y. Elec. Law &sect;&sect; 14-116 and 2-126, seeking a declaration that respondents, the state and a county board of elections and various political committees and entities, had engaged in illegal conduct. The voters also sought an order directing the return of contributions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The voters contended that various respondents made contributions that were in excess of the corporate contribution limit, that campaign funds were illegally spent to aid a particular campaign, and that several respondents entered into a conspiracy for such illegal spending. The court initially found that the voters had standing, as they alleged violations of the legislative mandates of the New York Election Law. Further, N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 2-126 did not violate the voters' First Amendment rights, as they were still able to endorse a candidate's nomination and it protected an important governmental interest. The claim against a political action committee (PAC), even if there was jurisdiction over it, did not show that it was a corporation that was bound by the $ 5,000 limit, nor that it had exceeded the $ 150,000 limit for PACs. Further, there was no showing that the candidate or his committee engaged in illegal conduct. However, there was evidence that expenditures were made that violated N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 2-126 in attempting to encourage voters to elect the candidate. The court found that injunctive relief was moot and financial fines were within the board of elections' domain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court dismissed the claims against various respondents, including the PAC, the candidate, and his political committee. The court declared that expenditures were made in violation of the New York Election Law with respect to the primary election, and it forwarded the matter to the county district attorney's office for determination of what remedy was appropriate due to the violations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Petitioners had standing, as qualified voters under Election Law &sect; 16-114 (3), to challenge the campaign contributions made to aid a candidate in the 2004 Albany County Democratic primary for District Attorney as being violative of the $ 5,000 corporate contribution limit (Election Law &sect; 14-116) and the prohibition against a political party making contributions to candidates &quot;to be voted for at a primary election&quot; (Election Law &sect; 2-126). Petitioners' underlying challenge involved legislatively mandated requirements of the Election Law, and was not directed to the internal affairs or operating functions of any political party. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Election Law &sect; 2-126, which prohibits a political party from making contributions to candidates &quot;to be voted for at a primary election,&quot; was not unconstitutional as applied to respondents to challenge the campaign contributions they made to aid a candidate in the 2004 Albany County Democratic primary for District Attorney. The statute does not unconstitutionally inhibit First Amendment rights or prohibit a party's endorsement of a candidate for nomination. The statute serves a substantial government interest in removing both actual corruption and the appearance thereof from the electoral process.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Primary Elections -- Restrictions on Campaign Contributions</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Petitioners' challenge to the campaign contributions made to aid a candidate in a primary as being violative of the $ 5,000 corporate contribution limit (Election Law &sect; 14-116) was dismissed, because they failed to demonstrate that respondent political action committee made any corporate donation in excess of $ 5,000. Furthermore, while respondent political party violated Election Law &sect; 2-126 by illegally spending money to promote a candidate in the primary election, injunctive relief was not warranted. The expenditures had already been made and any injunctive relief with respect to the primary was moot. Moreover, attempting to restrain the party from financially supporting any candidate in the general election would have violated the First Amendment rights of the party members.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, three bar/restaurants, commenced a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, seeking: 1) review of respondent board of health services' findings that each restaurant was guilty of violating N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 1399-o; 2) to vacate and annul the board's decision and order; and 3) to find the New York State &quot;Clean Indoor Act&quot; unconstitutional due to its vagueness as to the enforcement of N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect;&sect; 1399-o and -t.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board held three separate administrative hearings and found each restaurant guilty of violating the Clean Indoor Act, N.Y. Pub. Health Law art. 13-E, based on testimony from an investigator that there was smoking in the establishments. Although the restaurants indicated that they had posted &quot;No Smoking&quot; signs and removed all ashtrays, the investigator indicated that there were liquid-filled cups that were used for cigarette butts. On review, the court found that the determination by the board was erroneous. It was undisputed that the restaurants had complied with the requirements of the sign posting. Further, the investigator had testified that when she entered each restaurant, patrons were already smoking. Accordingly, there was no indication whether the bartenders had notified the patrons to stop smoking before she entered the premises. The court concluded that the determination by the board was therefore arbitrary and capricious, and not supported by the evidence. The challenge as to the constitutionality of the Act was not reviewed, as there was no indication that the attorney general had been served with notice of the petition, as required by N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 71.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the petition to the extent of vacating and annulling the board's findings of fact, decision, and order.

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A determination that petitioners, bars and restaurants, violated the Clean Indoor Air Act (Public Health Law &sect;1399-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">o</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) cannot be sustained. The act requires the owners of bars and food service establishments to post &quot;No-Smoking&quot; signs and to inform individuals who are smoking in an area where smoking is prohibited that they are in violation of the law. It is undisputed that &quot;No-Smoking&quot; signs were properly posted at petitioners' establishments. Therefore, the determination was based solely on the investigator's testimony that she observed people already smoking when she entered each establishment and that, during the 10 to 25 minutes she was in each establishment, she did not observe the bartenders take any action to prohibit smoking. However, inasmuch as the investigator was not present before the smokers began smoking, she had no actual knowledge of what action the bartenders may or may not have taken prior to her arrival. The mere fact that patrons continued to smoke in defiance of the law was not ipso facto evidence of the establishment's failure to comply with the law, as the law does not require that bar or restaurant owners refuse service to patrons who refuse to comply with the law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parents' 14-year-old son was roller blading without a helmet when he was struck by the driver's car. He suffered traumatic head injuries. The parents filed a personal injury suit, and defendants sought to introduce testimony from a doctor who was expected to testify that had the boy been wearing a helmet when his head struck the street, he would not have sustained head injuries. The court granted the parents' motion to preclude such testimony in the liability phase, finding that with respect to the boy's cause of action, his failure to have worn a helmet, as mandated by N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1238, could not be used in any way as a defense or in mitigation of his damages. The court found also that the statute was constitutional, noting that the legislature had a legitimate objective in enacting it, which was to protect children who were sustaining serious head injuries in alarming numbers with the increased popularity of in-line skating. Lastly, the court ruled that the boy's failure to wear a helmet could properly be considered by the jury in determining whether each parent had the right to recover in their claims for the boy's loss of services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In a personal injury action to recover damages for head injuries allegedly sustained by the infant plaintiff when he was struck by defendant's vehicle while he was roller blading on a street, defendant was precluded by statute from introducing into evidence during the liability phase the testimony of an expert biomechanical engineer relative to the infant plaintiff's failure to wear a helmet. Although persons under the age of 14 are required by law to wear safety helmets while using in-line skates (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1238 [5-a]), the failure to comply with this statutory requirement &quot;shall not constitute contributory negligence or assumption of risk, and shall not in any way bar, preclude or foreclose an action for personal injury or wrongful death by or on behalf of such person, nor in any way diminish or reduce the damages recoverable in any such action&quot; (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1238 [7]). Consequently, the infant plaintiff's failure to wear a helmet, as mandated by statute, could not be used in any way as a defense or in mitigation of his damages. However, the statute was not applicable to the parents' derivative action, and the jury was thus entitled to hear that evidence solely for the purpose of determining whether each parent had the right to recover for the loss of their child's services. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a personal injury action to recover damages for head injuries allegedly sustained by the infant plaintiff when he was struck by a vehicle while he was roller blading on a street, defendants failed to demonstrate that Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1238 (7), which provides that a child's failure to wear a safety helmet while in-line skating as required by law cannot be used in any way in a civil action as a defense or in mitigation of the child's damages, was unconstitutional as violative of due process. Defendants failed to demonstrate that the statute was not reasonably related to protecting children in the manner intended. The statutory requirement that persons under the age of 14 wear safety helmets while in-line skating (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1238 [5-a]) serves the legitimate public purpose of protecting children from sustaining head injuries while engaging in that activity. It was within the Legislature's prerogative to limit the penalties for the failure to comply with the statutory requirement. </SPAN></P>

The infant recalled certain facts, to which he had testified, and he executed an errata sheet with respect to his examination, having changed certain of his testimony, explaining the change based upon his having been confused at the time of his deposition or as a result of his having misspoken. Under these circumstances, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Noseworthy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> charge was not warranted. </SPAN></P>

Defendant driver had private insurance, defendant leasing company was self-insured, and there was a cross claim for contractual indemnification. Thus, defendants were not so united in interest as to warrant a single defense.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant previously filed a motion to dismiss in the same court under the same indictment due to the alleged insufficiency of the evidence adduced before the grand jury. The trial court refused to dismiss second degree murder charge. Upon completion of the trial, defendant was convicted of second degree murder. The conviction was reversed on grounds unrelated to the instant application. Defendant then filed the instant motion seeking dismissal of the second degree murder count, arguing that the evidence adduced before the grand jury and before the petit jury was insufficient to support the second degree murder charge. Defendant also argued that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 125.25(2) was unconstitutionally vague. The motion, if treated as a motion seeking reargument, was untimely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2221(d)(3), as it was not filed within 30 days following service of the order denying the prior motion. If the trial court considered the motion as a de novo application, the law of the case precluded defendant from raising the issues in the motion before the trial court, as they were raised in the previous motion and that motion was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant climbed a tree on a university campus and refused to descend after being told to do so by university police officers and officials. One officer testified that he ordered defendant to climb down because he was concerned that she might fall or that the tree might blow over. However, defendant was tied to the tree by a safety line. A university official read the campus regulations to defendant, but it was noted that there was no specific prohibition against tree climbing or tree-sitting. The court found that it was unclear whether tree-sitting was a prohibited First Amendment activity if done during the time that defendant engaged in the activity. However, it was clear that the &quot;trespass&quot; was an integral part of defendant's speech, in that the act of sitting in the tree actually was the &quot;speech.&quot; As there was no showing that her presence in the tree was incompatible with the university's normal activities, the charge lacked merit. The disorderly conduct charges also required dismissal, as there was no showing of public inconvenience or the likelihood of same, and there was no hazard to anyone but defendant. Further, her action had a legitimate purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Defendant's conduct in tree sitting on the grounds of the university where she was an enrolled student to protest the felling of trees to create a parking lot on the campus, despite being told to descend by university officials, did not constitute trespass (Penal Law &sect; 140.05) in the absence of any proof that her presence in the tree was incompatible with the university's normal activities of teaching and research. Defendant was well-equipped and used safety gear to prevent injury. Defendant's tree sitting constituted protected First Amendment activity, especially in view of the university's own student policies encouraging peaceful protest as being essential to academic freedom and the function of the university as an educational institution. There was insufficient evidence that defendant's tree sitting was any different from picketing on the ground. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner couple brought an action to adopt two children who were borne out of wedlock. After being served a notice of adoption, respondent children's biological father appeared and moved to compel respondent adoption agency and respondent pre-adoptive parents to provide him with discovery materials. The children's law guardian and the agency opposed the motion. The motion implicated N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111-a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The determinative issue in deciding whether the father had a right to discover materials was whether the father was a &quot;party.&quot; The court concluded that the father was not a party, but he was an interested person. Section 111-a provided the father with a right to be heard concerning the children's best interests as an interested person. Section 111-a did not confer on the father any additional rights. The United States Supreme Court's decision in Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972), held, in effect, that the father had a constitutional due process right to be heard concerning the best interests of the child; Stanley did not hold that the father had substantive rights. Stanley did hold that a statute declaring that the father of an illegitimate child was deemed unfit to be a parent was unconstitutional as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Since Stanley, the New York Legislature had not provided any substantive rights to the father other than the right to be heard. Therefore, since the father did not have the requisite substantive rights to be a &quot;party,&quot; he did not have a right to discovery. N.Y. C.P.L.R. &sect; 3120(1) provided that only parties had a right to discovery.</SPAN></P>

The sole purpose of the statutory notice is to afford a putative father the right to be heard and present evidence relevant to the best interests of his child. The right to notice made the putative father an interested person, but did not elevate him to the status of a party in the adoption proceeding. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation was charged with violating a municipal ordinance that prohibited engaging in the collection of solid waste without a permit. The corporation, which was small and closely held, sought to allow the prosecution and disposition of the matter without an attorney. Pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 600.20, a corporation could only appear in a criminal matter by counsel. The court held that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 600.20 was unconstitutional, as it denied corporations equal protection of the law. Under United States Supreme Court rulings, corporations were persons under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. It was settled law that defendants in criminal proceedings had a right to defend pro se. The court found no compelling state interest achieved by forcing a particular class of person, corporations, to appear by counsel. The court found numerous inconsistencies regarding the rights of corporations in New York law. Corporations were allowed in commercial actions to bring actions without counsel, and the requirement for counsel in civil actions had been relaxed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, a closely held private corporation charged with violating a local ordinance that prohibits the collection of solid waste in the township without a permit, had the right to appear in the criminal proceeding by its president without counsel. Corporations, as persons under the 14th Amendment, have a fundamental right to defend pro se by a corporate officer in a criminal proceeding. CPL 600.20, which requires that corporate criminal defendants appear only by counsel, is unconstitutional as violative of equal protection under the law under either a strict scrutiny or rational basis analysis. This requirement serves no compelling state interest, especially in view of the relaxation of the appearance by counsel rule in certain civil cases (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CPLR 321; UDCA 1809).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The organization sought a permit to allow for a rally in a park, despite the fact that it had previously agreed to hold the event in a different location. After the permit was denied, the organization filed an action seeking injunctive and declaratory relief based on a violation of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. In denying relief, the court determined that the request for a special events permit was properly denied because the elements for an injunction were not met. The New York City Parks Department appropriately applied the content-neutral regulations contained in New York City, N.Y., R. tit. 56, &sect; 2-08 while leaving the organization with a reasonable alternative site suitable with ample means of communication. The city was not required to grant the permit exactly as requested. The right to free speech did not guarantee the organization the best location for its communication. Moreover, by seeking to invoke the court's equity jurisdiction just days prior to the event, the organization foreclosed an opportunity for the city to formulate an appropriate plan to ensure the safety of the public and protect the park from irreparable damage.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff had &quot;unclean hands&quot; because it was guilty of inexcusable and inequitable delay and was thus not entitled to any equitable relief.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, a coalition and its administrative coordinator, filed a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding against respondent New York Temporary State Commission on Lobbying seeking to compel it to adopt rules governing adjudicatory proceedings and a declaration that a finding by the Commission that petitioners wilfully failed to file a client semiannual report was null and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission argued that the coalition lacked standing. The trial court held that the coalition was not a proper petitioner, but that the coordinator was a de facto officer performing equivalent functions and had standing to bring the suit in a representative capacity. The Commission was directed to determine whether anyone had knowingly and wilfully violated the New York Lobbying Act (Act), 1981 N.Y. Laws 1040, without giving that person notice and a hearing. The penalty hearings authorized were not adjudicative hearings under the New York State Administrative Procedures Act (SAPA), N.Y. A.P.A. &sect; 101 et seq. Thus, the Commission was not an agency and was not subject to the SAPA. The statutory scheme did not provide due process as it allowed a lobbyist to be deprived of property without notice and the opportunity to be heard. The Commission's guidelines could not correct the defect in &sect; 1-n(b) and (c) of the Act. Further, the Commission lacked the statutory authority to issue the guidelines as the statute directed the Commission to make its ruling before holding a penalty hearing. The guidelines created notice and a hearing, were inconsistent with the statute, and were a nullity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Petitioner, the administrative coordinator of an unincorporated association facing penalties for allegedly failing to comply with the filing requirements of the Lobbying Act (Legislative Law &sect; 1-c [c]), had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutory scheme on behalf of the association even though any action brought on behalf of an unincorporated association must normally be maintained by the association's president or treasurer (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;General Associations Law &sect; 12). Since the association had no president or treasurer, petitioner, as the de facto officer performing the equivalent functions and responsibilities of those positions, had the necessary capacity to sue on the association's behalf. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.

The Commission is not an &quot;agency&quot; authorized to make rules or make final decisions in adjudicatory proceedings (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;State Administrative Procedure Act &sect; 102 [1]). </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Portions of the Lobbying Act are unconstitutional as violative of due process to the extent they fail to provide for notice and the opportunity for a hearing prior to a violation determination. The statute directs respondent New York Temporary State Commission on Lobbying to unilaterally determine whether there has been a knowing and willful violation of the Lobbying Act without affording the alleged violator notice and the opportunity for a hearing. The only hearing authorized under the statute is a hearing to determine the amount of the penalty to be assessed against the violator (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Legislative Law &sect; 1-n [b], [c]). Under these circumstances, the procedural guidelines adopted by respondent providing for written notice to the violator and the opportunity for a hearing upon the charges are insufficient to remedy the constitutional defects in the statutory scheme. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff arbitration applicants sued defendants, the New York State Insurance Department and its Superintendent, seeking a judgment declaring that N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 11 &sect; 65-4.5(o)(1) violated the Due Process Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions and restraining arbitrators from invoking it at arbitration hearings regarding no-fault insurance benefits. The Department and Superintendent moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The applicants said N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 65-4.5(o)(1) and 65-4.2(b)(3) precluded proof responding to new issues arbitrators raised, violating procedural due process. They said &sect; 65-4.2(b)(3)(iv), giving arbitrators discretion to accept additional written proof, did not cure the violation as it was discretionary and no supplemental oral argument was guaranteed. Further, the same regulations bound the master arbitrators to whom the applicants could appeal. Due process required a chance to be heard and to submit evidence. The regulations provided that opportunity and ensured that arbitration decisions comported with due process by allowing appeals to a master arbitrator and judicial review. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 65-4.5(o)(1) and 65-4.2(b)(3) allowed supplementation of a claimant's submissions and could constitutionally be applied in tandem, so the applicants' facial challenge had to be dismissed. The applicants did not exhaust administrative remedies by seeking a master arbitrator's review, nor did they challenge a specific regulatory application, so they had no standing to challenge the regulations as applied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- No-Fault Automobile Insurance -- Validity of No-Fault Regulations Permitting Submission of Supplementary Papers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No-fault arbitration regulations, which authorize the arbitrator to permit supplementation of the claimant's original submissions, but do not guarantee a right to supplemental oral argument (11 NYCRR 65-4.2 [b] [3]), are not facially unconstitutional because they prevent a claimant from submitting additional proof in response to new issues raised by arbitrators. The regulations as a whole provide procedural safeguards through the appellate process. Claimants may appeal adverse decisions to master arbitrators and may further seek judicial review of those decisions to ensure that arbitration decisions comport with constitutional due process requirements (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Insurance Law &sect; 5106 [c]; 11 NYCRR 65-4.10). Furthermore, plaintiffs lacked standing to bring an &quot;as applied&quot; due process challenge, since they failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought to dismiss charges against him of Aggravated Harassment in the Second Degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.30(1), a misdemeanor criminal offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The complainant's husband had allegedly made harassing telephone calls to defendant's wife. Defendant allegedly called the complaining witness and left a message on her cell phone telling the complainant that if the complainant's husband did not stop calling his wife, defendant would &quot;bury her,&quot; and that she had &quot;been warned.&quot; Defendant was charged with violating &sect; 240.30(1) and sought to dismiss the charges. The court first noted that a decision of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York declared that &sect; 240.30(1) violated the First Amendment but that a decision of the Appellate Term, Second Department held that the provision withstood constitutional scrutiny. The court then denied the motion. Whether the alleged &quot;threat&quot; met the applicable constitutional or statutory standards was &quot;usually a question of fact,&quot; and on a motion to dismiss for facial insufficiency, the court held the People to a less strict standard than would be the case at trial. However, the court noted that arguably defendant's phone call was not within the statutory definition because it was an isolated, angry outburst not reasonably to be taken seriously as a threat.</SPAN></P>

The aggravated harassment statute, which proscribes communicating &quot;with another person . . . by telephone . . . in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm&quot; when the communication is made &quot;with intent to harass, annoy, threaten or alarm&quot; such other person (Penal Law &sect; 240.30 [1]), is not unconstitutional on its face as being violative of the First Amendment right to free speech. The factual issue of whether defendant's message constituted a proscribable genuine threat, or was merely an isolated, angry outburst not reasonably to be taken seriously as a threat, could not be determined on a motion to dismiss for facial insufficiency.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, Unitarian-Universalist ministers, moved to dismiss on constitutional grounds their prosecutions for violating N.Y. Dom. Rel. &sect; 17, which made it a misdemeanor to perform a marriage without being presented with a marriage license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 17 made it a misdemeanor to perform marriages without being presented with a license. When local officials in a New York town refused to issue licenses to same-sex couples, two ministers proceeded to perform religious ceremonies in front of the courthouse. The court dismissed the charges against the ministers. The prosecution had not shown any rational relationship between the prohibition against issuing licenses to same-sex couples and the legitimate state interest in providing a favorable environment for procreation and child-rearing, and traditional views of marriage were no justification at all. Furthermore, New York statutory, regulatory, and case law were replete with examples indicating a supportive attitude toward stable same-sex unions. Under the circumstances, there was no rational basis for &sect; 17 as applied to the ministers. Prosecution of the ministers violated both federal constitutional principles and New York public policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Unauthorized Performance of Marriage Ceremonies for Same-Sex Couples</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c7"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendants, two ordained ministers, were entitled to dismissal of misdemeanor charges arising from their performance of marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples who did not have valid marriage licenses (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Domestic Relations Law &sect; 17). Defendants demonstrated that it was unconstitutional as violative of equal protection to prohibit same-sex couples from obtaining marriage licenses. Consequently, it was also unconstitutional to charge defendants with a crime for marrying same-sex couples who were unable to obtain marriage licenses. The justifications of &quot;tradition&quot; and procreation proffered by the prosecution for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples were inadequate to sustain the constitutionality of defendants' criminal prosecution under the rational basis test. &quot;Tradition&quot; is not a legitimate state interest and did not justify unconstitutional treatment. Furthermore, prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying is not rationally related to furthering the State's legitimate interest in providing a favorable environment for procreation and child rearing. </SPAN></P>
