</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Task Force appointed by the Governor issued reports that criticized the operations of SPCAs and recommended either repeal or substantial modification of the statutes that confer law enforcement authority upon the private groups. A county prosecutor's office entered a directive suspending its county SPCA's law enforcement functions. The State SPCA then successfully sought to revoke that county's certificate on grounds that the directive and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which provided that the prosecutor's office was to supervise the county SPCA's law enforcement activities rendered the county SPCA incapable of carrying out its statutory duties. On appeal, the court reversed, agreeing with the State Attorney General's amicus curiae brief, which argued that a county prosecutor had constitutional and statutory authority under N.J. Const. art. VII, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:158-4, and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:17B-112(b), to oversee all law enforcement activities within the county, including enforcement of the provisions of Title 4 governing cruelty to animals, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:22-17 and N.J. Stat. Ann. 4:22-24, and that the MOU constituted a proper exercise of that authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of two violations of an anti-noise ordinance and ordered to pay a fine of $ 500 and costs of $ 30 as to the first summons and a fine of $ 750 and costs of $ 30 as to the second summons. After a trial de novo, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Monmouth County, found defendant guilty as to both summonses and imposed the same sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the subject ordinance was unconstitutional because the subjective nature of the wording rendered it impermissibly vague. Defendant claimed that words including &quot;loud,&quot; &quot;unnecessary,&quot; and &quot;likely to annoy&quot; were subjective and lacked any objective component. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the ordinance set forth specific, objective criteria for a violation to occur: clearly audible noise at a distance of 100 feet from the building in which it was located was prima facie evidence of a violation of the ordinance. Thus, reasonable people were able to understand the proscriptions set forth in the ordinance. Defendant also argued that the law division erred by applying the ordinance in a subjective manner and not taking into account the reasonableness of defendant's conduct and thus, the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied. The appellate court concluded that the law division properly considered the reasonableness of defendant's conduct when balanced against the objective right of nearby citizens to be free from the nuisance of excessive noise as proscribed by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the law division court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, appellant out-of-state insurers challenged a decision by the Tax Court of New Jersey, which approved a methodology used by respondent, the director of the state division of taxation, for calculating the retaliatory insurance tax under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:32-15 so as to recapture the benefits to the foreign insurers that would otherwise exist under the premium tax cap at N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:18A-6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The various out-of-state insurers recognized that the director's calculation of premium and retaliatory taxes deprived them of some or all of the benefit of the premium tax cap in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:18A-6. They sought refunds, but the requests were denied. Their various appeals were consolidated before the tax court, which affirmed the director's determination. On appeal, the insurers argued that the director's interpretation of the premium and retaliatory tax statutes operated to recapture the benefits of the premium cap and thereby defeated the purpose of the cap of inducing out-of-state insurers to do business in-state. They also argued that it failed to fulfill the tax equalization purpose of the retaliatory tax. The court agreed, finding that the two tax statutes could be applied to give effect to both. The director's interpretation eviscerated tax equalization under the retaliatory tax by recouping all the benefits provided by the premium tax cap statute, thereby defeating the business attracting purpose of that statute. Finally, the interpretation acted to impose a higher tax only on foreign insurers for revenue-generating purposes, which likely violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision and remanded with directions that the director recalculate the refunds due to the insurers because of overpayments from the director's improper calculation of premium and retaliatory taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State and intervenor probation officers' unions appealed a summary judgment from a New Jersey Superior Court, Law Division, Mercer County, in an action brought by plaintiff administrative director, finding N.J. Pub. Law 2001, ch. 362 (the Act), codified in part at N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2B:10-1 to -3 and amending N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-6, unconstitutional on grounds of violating separation of powers under N.J. Const. art. III, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court had, on several occasions, issued directives forbidding probation officers to carry firearms. Nonetheless, the unions secured passage of the Act. The appellate court agreed that given the supreme court's responsibilities to administer the court system, under N.J. Const. art. VI, &sect; 2, para. 3 and &sect; 7, para. 1, the legislation violated separation of powers principles. It made no difference that the supreme court had often permitted legislation regarding employment conditions of court employees to stand--this simply meant that the legislation in question had not threatened the court system's ability to carry out its constitutional mission. The unions also argued that under their collective bargaining agreement with the administrative director's office, the dispute was subject to arbitration. The appellate court held that under the doctrine of necessity, the courts were required to determine statutory constitutionality, as no other tribunal was qualified to do so. The arbitration clause, moreover, applied to matters of grievance, not statutory construction or management issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a fraudulent real estate scheme, and he was eventually convicted of 119 charges. He was sentenced to imprisonment, and he served approximately four years in prison before being released on parole. His parole contained general and special conditions, the latter of which included a restitution payment plan, random urine testing and alcohol monitoring, and that he maintain steady employment or alternatively, participate in a vocational training/education program. Defendant obtained various employment positions in construction, and at one point, he worked for his son and became less compliant with other parole conditions. Accordingly, two more conditions were imposed regarding limitations on defendant's authority to enter contracts or to handle money. Modification of the new conditions was denied, and appeal thereof resulted in an administrative affirmance. On further review, the court found that the employment restrictions did not exceed the authority under the Parole Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30:4-123.45 to -123.76. However, the language used was too wide-ranging, all-encompassing, and confusing, such that the conditions were void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court, struck the two additional special conditions of parole, and remanded the matter for the Parole Board to redraft the parole conditions in an appropriately constitutional form.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Camden County, which convicted defendant of third-degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance (heroin), third-degree possession of heroin with intent to distribute, and third-degree possession of heroin with intent to distribute within a school zone. Defendant was sentenced to an extended term as a repeat drug offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the prosecutor's summation was improper in that it boosted a police officer's credibility and misstated the law. The court found that the prosecutor's response to defendant's allegation that the police officer was lying was somewhat excessive but was not clearly capable of producing an unjust result. Further, the court found no misleading statement of the law on reasonable doubt. The court also found no error with regard to the trial court's jury instructions permitting the jury to consider evidence of drug quantity and packaging, because the trial judge instructed the jury in accordance with the model jury charge without objection from defendant. Further, no expert was required in order to allow the jury to draw the inference of defendant's intent to distribute the drugs. The court did find that the trial judge erred in imposing the presumptive extended base term sentence on account of defendant's single prior conviction, as such was a form of double-counting in that the factors used to establish the degree of the crime were not applicable when calculating the length of the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff township residents appealed a decision from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, which dismissed the counts of their complaint challenging a ban on wild deer feeding under Princeton, N.J., Twp. Ordinance &sect; 2001-25 (Ordinance), and which upheld the validity of the Ordinance provided that defendant township made a minor modification to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents challenged the constitutionality of the Ordinance, arguing that a prohibition on the knowing feeding of wild deer on public and private lands throughout the township on the grounds arbitrarily and unreasonably deprived them of their property right to feed wild deer on their land. They also challenged the Ordinance on vagueness and overbreadth grounds. Their challenge was rejected and the Ordinance was upheld. On appeal, the residents asserted the same arguments. The court held that there was no constitutional infirmity inherent in the Ordinance. There was no cognizable property right in feeding wild deer that was subject to due process guarantees since wild game belonged to the people of New Jersey, not the individual property owners. Moreover, the township's goals in adopting the Ordinance were clearly ascertainable and legitimate. Finally, the means selected--a ban on feeding wild deer--was rationally related to a legislative end and the evidence presented demonstrated the ban bore a real and substantial relationship to the legislated end. The residual constitutional challenges on overbreadth and vagueness grounds lacked merit and warranted little discussion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision upholding the validity of the township's ban on wild deer feeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a Democrat, switched to the Republican party. Before completing her term as a member of the city council, she switched back to the Democratic party. She intended to stand for reelection as a Democrat. The organization denied her request to participate in its &quot;screening process,&quot; explaining that she was not qualified to participate in the screening process because she had not been a registered Democrat for at least two years preceding the screening. Plaintiff brought an action against the organization, seeking permission to participate in the screening process. She also sought the invalidation of an amendment to the organization's bylaws. The trial court denied relief. On appeal, the court originally held that the screening process violated the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:34-52. The organization moved for reconsideration. On reconsideration, the court held that &sect; 19:34-52 was rendered unconstitutional by virtue of a United States Supreme Court decision. However, plaintiff's failure to challenge the results of the primary elections was not cognizable because she failed to exhaust all of the available avenues for relief provided in the organization's bylaws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Camden County, which sentenced him for second-degree aggravated assault to a nine-year term with four and one-half years to be served before parole eligibility.  He also received concurrent five-year sentences for third-degree terroristic threats and third-degree criminal restraint, to be served consecutively to the sentence for aggravated assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the supreme court, and after the State declined to try defendant on the No Early Release Act (NERA) predicates for second-degree aggravated assault, defendant was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 14 years, with four and one-half years to be served before parole eligibility. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that the sentence was unconstitutional under Blakely, wherein the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum had to be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court declared that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-1f(1) was unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted the trial judge, as here, to increase the presumptive sentence in the absence of jury fact-finding. As the trial judge enhanced defendant's sentence for severely beating a woman based on aggravating factors that were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the court remanded the case to the Law Division and gave the State the option of trying the relevant aggravating factors, previously found by the trial judge, to the jury on all convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the Law Division for further proceedings. The court stayed its opinion and directed that, until the Supreme Court considered the issue, trial courts should continue sentencing as usual, as a defendant not sentenced consistent with the court's understanding of the mandate in Blakely could obtain relief on direct appeal and on petition to correct an &quot;illegal sentence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a county board of education and one of its constituent school districts, appealed a decision from respondent State Board of Education (New Jersey), regarding the apportionment of seats on the regional district board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal challenged the inclusion of state prison inmates in the population of inhabitants in deciding the apportionment of seats and also challenged the use of the equal proportions method. The court affirmed in part, holding that the specific requirement in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:13-8 of the use of the equal proportions method to apportion regional school district seats in districts with more than nine constituent districts did not prohibit the use of the equal proportions method for regional districts of nine or fewer constituent districts. Section 18A:13-8 gave discretion to the appropriate education officials to use a method geared to achieve the legislative goal of allocating seats as nearly as possible based upon population. The court found error, however, in the inclusion of state prison inmates in the population. The statutory language of &sect; 18A:13-8 requiring the subtraction of state prison inmates from the inhabitant population for regional districts with nine or fewer constituent districts was clear and unequivocal. Moreover, the legislative history indicated that inmates were to be counted only in districts with more than nine constituent districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision to the extent that it authorized the use of the equal proportions method, reversed as to the inclusion of state prison inmates in the population of inhabitants, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Ocean County, denied defendant father's motion to dismiss plaintiff administrator's wrongful death action. A directed verdict on liability was then entered, and a jury awarded the administrator damages and prejudgment interest. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant appeal raised the issue of whether an amendment to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:31-3, which eliminated the two-year statute of limitations for wrongful death claims arising from a murder, aggravated manslaughter or manslaughter, applied retroactively to allow the administrator to litigate her claim against her father for the murder of her mother. The appeals court held that it did, as the legislature was conscious of allowing a remedy to a murder victim's surviving family. Second, the father did not lose a contractual claim by removal of the procedural bar to the instant lawsuit. At the time of the amendment, the father had nothing more than an expectation of an inheritance. Moreover, passage of the limitation period barred only a procedural remedy, not the substantive right. Third, the court rejected the father's argument that the legislature intended only to resurrect causes of action that arose prior to the amendment but criminal proceedings of which had not yet been resolved and which had not yet been time-barred. The father did not identify any reliance placed upon the time-bar, and his belief that he could no longer be sued could be no more than a hope or expectation.</SPAN></P>

He also argued his statement to police should have been suppressed because he was not advised of his right under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and Optional Protocol on Disputes, April 24, 1963, art. 36, 21 U.S.T. 77, T.I.A.S. No. 6820 (Convention), to contact the consulate of his native country. The court found that defendant's counsel expressly declined an instruction on identification and affirmatively asserted that identification was not an issue. Use of the alias was not prejudicial, as the evidence showed a contested issue existed on whether the nickname was associated with defendant. No private enforceable right existed under the Convention, and suppression was not applicable as a remedy for violations. Finally, Apprendi was not violated, as a life sentence was the statutory maximum available for murder, and aggravating factors justified increasing the penalty for the weapon offenses.</SPAN></P>

Reversing, the court held that New Jersey's criminal instrumentality forfeiture law, N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a city planning board, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County, that held that plaintiff builder was entitled to conditional use approval to build a two-family dwelling in a single-family residential zone. The board originally denied the builder's application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The builder applied for conditional use approval to build a two-family residence on a single-family residential lot. He filed his application with the local planning board, not the zoning board of adjustment. He submitted site plans drafted by an architect to illustrate his proposal. He also gave notice of his application to surrounding property owners. However, in reviewing the board's denial, there were no conditions included in the conditional use authorization. Because South Amboy, N.J., Dev. Regs. Ordinance &sect; 53-88C(6) was void as too vague, the planning board never had authority to review the builder's application. The planning board inquired into the builder's motivations for building a two-family dwelling versus building two separate single-family dwellings. The board could not make such inquiries where it had no authority to modify the application to satisfy those criteria. As such, it was proper to reject the conditional use permit application and to allow the zoning board to proceed with a &quot;d&quot; variance application. Further, it was proper to place legitimate concerns about parking, drainage, signs, traffic, and emergency access before the zoning board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to the ruling that three lots were separate lots, and the planning board's actions were arbitrary and unreasonable. However, the builder was authorized to proceed before the zoning board to seek variances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a condominium association, appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Special Civil Part, Monmouth County, that required the association to refund six months of condominium maintenance fees to plaintiff, the current owner of a condominium. The owner cross-appealed the judgment holding the owner was responsible for a capital contribution assessment and administrative processing fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the association argued that it was entitled to association costs and maintenance fees that were assessable to the prior owner. The trial court correctly concluded, however, that the language of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:8B-21(e) precluded the association from collecting maintenance fees attributable to the prior owner. Accordingly, the association was not entitled to collect association fees accrued by the prior owner. Moreover, the owner, on cross-appeal, contended that the issuance of the sheriff's deed was merely a ministerial act and the date purely an arbitrary date with no significance with regard to actual date the owner assumed title to the condominium. The owner argued that it should not have been assessed the additional charges because it had no control as to when the deed was dated. However, the execution of the sheriff's deed occurred, and the owner acquired title on that date. Thus, the owner was obligated to pay the amount of the assessments applicable to those unit owners who acquired title.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments were affirmed as to the appeal and the cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a non profit corporation and others, appealed an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, which granted summary judgment to defendants, a mayor and borough council (council), and dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in lieu of prerogative writs challenging the council's designation of an area in need of redevelopment under the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law (LRHL), N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The area determined to be in need of redevelopment consisted of municipally-owned properties located in the central business district of the borough.

Affirming, the court held, inter alia, that (1) there was ample basis for the trial court's ruling that the designation was of sufficient public interest to warrant relaxation of the 45-day filing limitation through application of N.J. Ct. R. 4:69-6(c); (2) there was substantial credible evidence supporting the council's determination that the properties constituted an area in need of redevelopment pursuant to the criteria set forth in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:12A-5(d) and (e); (3) the terms &quot;blighted area,&quot; as used in N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, para. 1, and &quot;an area in need of redevelopment,&quot; as used in the LRHL, were synonymous; and (4) the relative affluence of the borough or its residents was irrelevant in the calculus of determining whether the area was in need of redevelopment because it met the criteria set forth in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:12A-5 and was supported by substantial credible evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an insurance agent and had procured a health care policy for himself. A grocery store videotape showed defendant allegedly staging a slip-and-fall on a piece of lettuce. Defendant had commenced a civil suit against the grocery store asserting business invitee negligence, which was subsequently voluntarily dismissed by defendant's civil attorney after viewing the surveillance videotape. Defendant had submitted 19 claims to the insurance company, which were paid. The fraud investigator for the insurance company testified that the company would not have paid the claims had it known that defendant staged the slip-and-fall. Defendant contended on appeal that he was improperly convicted because he legitimately sustained injuries in the slip-and-fall, whether or not it was staged. The court disagreed and found that &sect; 2C:21-4.3c encompassed intentional slip-and-fall situations. The court found no error in the trial court's prevention of defendant's expert from testifying as to his opinion that the slip-and-fall was not staged, because such issue was for the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978, the inmate began serving a 17.5 to 35-year sentence in Pennsylvania. Pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:159A-1 et seq., the inmate was transferred to New Jersey to stand trial. In 1978, he was sentenced in New Jersey from 22 to 55 years to be served concurrently with the Pennsylvania sentence. The inmate was returned to Pennsylvania and served the remainder of his sentence. When he was granted parole by Pennsylvania, the inmate was transferred to a New Jersey prison. The Department denied the inmate's request for work credits for work he did while in prison in Pennsylvania. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4-92, which prohibited the inmate from receiving credits for work performed by him in Pennsylvania while serving a sentencing concurrent to his New Jersey sentence, violated the inmate's equal protection rights under N.J. Const. art. I, para. 1. The Department did not provide a reasoned basis for distinguishing between the inmate serving a concurrent sentence out-of-state, for which an inmate did not receive work credits in New Jersey, and a prisoner serving a sentence in state, for which the inmate did receive work credits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The final decision was reversed, and the case was remanded to the Department to secure from Pennsylvania information as to the inmate's Pennsylvania work experience and to determine the amount of work credits to which the inmate was entitled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a board of education and a member of that board (board), appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, that found the Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act (MRERA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:27BBB-1 to -65 in general, and the December 2002 amendments to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:27BBB-63 and -64 in particular, were not special legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the board contended that MRERA violated the State constitution because it was special legislation and that any gubernatorial veto of school board action violated the Open Public Meetings Act. The board commenced an action to enjoin sections 67 and 68 of MRERA as special legislation. These sections authorized the governor to veto the minutes of the board of education and establish the composition of the board. The board argued that there was no rational basis for having a scheme to aid the recovery of a distressed municipality include a state takeover of the municipal school board. However, it was of no constitutional consequence that only one city currently satisfied the definition as a &quot;qualifying municipality.&quot; The determinative factor was that municipalities other than one under which the board fell may have qualified for the remedies allowed by MRERA. Consequently, the act was not unconstitutional as being special legislation. Finally, the fact that the governor could have vetoed a school board decision did not violate the New Jersey Open Public Meetings Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent county appealed from a final decision of the New Jersey Public Employment Commission that granted a petition in which petitioner public employees' union sought authorization to recover representation fees from non-member county employees, in accordance with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:13A-5.5(a), as amended in 2002. The county challenged the amendment's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New Jersey's Employer-Employee Relations Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 34:13A-1 to -5.9, had long allowed collective bargaining agreements to provide for collection by a union of a representation fee, in lieu of dues, from non-members who nonetheless benefited from representation. The amendment expanded the availability of representation fees to situations where no agreement had been reached on the issue. The county was the first employer to challenge the amendment. The court held, first, that the amendment plainly satisfied First Amendment requirements, since recoverable fees were restricted to collective bargaining costs and the statute included a demand and return procedure to prevent the use of fees for political purposes. Furthermore, since it applied to all public employers and unions, the amendment was not special legislation violating N.J. Const. art. IV, para. 7. The legislature was entitled to articulate public policy and to delegate its application to the commission, which had not ruled unreasonably, since the statutory conditions had been satisfied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA) adopted the 2003 Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP) to administer the 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 42 Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. Petitioner public interest groups, challenged the validity and discriminatory effect of the QAP under the &quot;affirmatively to further&quot; clause of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3608(e)(5) of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3601-3609.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the 2003 QAP had expired and the groups did not appeal the allocation of specific credits, the court declared the validity of the HMFA's application of certain legal concepts to apply to future QAPs. The group wanted the QAP to promote integration by generally siting affordable housing in areas that were not already home primarily to people of color, to develop a method to consider racial and other demographic information, and to modify its point system to foster racial integration and economic improvement for minorities. The court decided the QAP was properly adopted without the group having a hearing, as in a quasi-judicial setting, and then gave its reasoning based upon application of the clearly erroneous standard of review of the HMFA's adoption of the QAP why the QAP satisfied the HMFA's Title VIII &quot;affirmatively to further&quot; duty, and did not violate N.J. Const. art. I, para. 5, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4, para. 1, the Mount Laurel doctrine, or the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:5-1 et seq. The LAD declared all persons were to have the opportunity to obtain publicly assisted housing accommodation without discrimination because of race.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the HMFA's decision to adopt the 2003 QAP.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicants appealed the final agency action of appellee New Jersey State Parole Board denying the applications of the applicants, who were under community supervision for life pursuant to the New Jersey Violent Predator Incapacitation Act of 1994, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-6.4, in which they sought permission to live in New York State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants were subject to community supervision for life under the New Jersey Violent Predator Incapacitation Act of 1994 (Megan's Law), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-6.4. Although those subject to community supervision for life were supervised by the Board as if on parole, the Board had no administrative enforcement powers. As a result, other states were permitted but were not required to accept supervision of those subject to community supervision for life under the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision (UAOPS), codified in New Jersey under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:168-14 et seq. In the instant case, the applicants sought to move to New York, but New York refused to supervise them. The Board was allowed to permit those subject to community supervision for life to reside out-of-state in appropriate circumstances even if that state refused supervision. Allowing those subject to community supervision for life to live elsewhere was consistent with the primary purpose of Megan's Law, to protect New Jersey citizens from recidivism by those subject to community supervision for life, as New Jersey citizens were not endangered by those who moved out of state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The final agency action was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former students sued appellee school, its former music director, and other employees in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, for violations of the New Jersey Child Sexual Abuse Act of 1992, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:61B-1, and common law claims. The superior court granted the school's motion for summary judgment motion and dismissed the claims against the school. The students filed interlocutory appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students, when they were youths in the late 1960's and early 1970's, were boarding students at the school, a non-profit institution organized for educational purposes. They alleged sexual abuse by the school's former music director, the headmaster, and other school employees. The superior court dismissed the claims against the school because the school was not a person to which the Child Sexual Abuse Act applied; the N.J. Charitable Immunity Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:53A-7 to 2A:53A-11, barred the common-law claims; and the school was not vicariously liable for an incident that occurred when one student was visiting the music director after he withdrew from the school. On appeal, the court found that (1) the Child Sexual Abuse Act applied because the school was a person under the Act; (2) charitable immunity, under the Charitable Immunity Act, was not available to the school as a defense to the Child Sexual Abuse Act claim and to direct claims of intentional conduct by or attributed to the school arising out of sexual abuse; and (3) charitable immunity, under the Charitable Immunity Act, was a defense to the claims of negligent conduct by the school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal of one student was dismissed, as a settlement was reached between that student and the school. The orders of summary judgment were affirmed in part as to the common-law claims that arose from negligent conduct; the orders of summary judgment were reversed insofar as they related to the Child Sexual Abuse Act claims and the common-law claims premised upon intentional conduct. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school districts sought review of an order from respondent, the New Jersey Commissioner of Education (Commissioner), holding that neither the New Jersey Supreme Court's mandating of preschool programs nor the Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2004 required exclusive state funding of preschools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The districts challenged the New Jersey Department of Education's (DOE's) calculation of their Abbott Preschool Expansion Aid (PSEA) awards for the year 2003-04. The Commissioner concluded that neither the New Jersey Supreme Court's mandating of preschool programs nor the Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2004 required exclusive state funding. On appeal, the court concluded that the adoption of whole-school reform, with its inclusion of preschool education, was designed by the Supreme Court as a remedy for the past constitutional deprivation of a thorough and efficient education for children between the ages of five and 18 years. Because the Supreme Court had not mandated exclusive state funding for all aspects of preschool education, and because the legislature had not provided for the funding of preschool beyond the funding components of PSEA and Early Childhood Program Aid (ECPA), the court agreed with the determination of the Commissioner that the State was not mandated to exclusively fund preschool in the districts and that local resources, if available, could be allocated for such purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued a summary order, and through time extensions over a year later issued a final decision finding that appellant public utility was entitled to payment for an under-recovery for services that the utility provided to appellee county utilities authority. The Superior Court of Passaic County (New Jersey) affirmed the decision. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a written contract, the public utility provided solid waste transfer station operations and transportation services for the county utilities authority. After termination of the contract, the public utility continued to provide its services to the county utilities authority, based upon a series of interim rates that were adjusted from time to time, but never made permanent, until another public utility began to provide the services under a new contract. In a rate-setting proceeding, the Commissioner issued a summary order and then delayed over one year before issuing a final decision finding that a rate underpayment to the initial public utility existed and establishing the rate for the compensation. The court, in spite of the delay, affirmed the Commissioner's final decision because the rate applied by the Commissioner for the post-contract years was not unjust or unreasonable and there was adequate support in the record for the decision. However, the imposition of interest on the award from the date of the summary order until the date of the final order was required, and possibly for a still later period as well.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part as to the finding that there was an under-recovery and the rate that was determined, the judgment was reversed in part as to the denial of interest, the matter was dismissed in part as to compelling the adoption of the initial decision, and the matter was remanded to award an appropriate amount of interest to the public utility for the delay between the summary order and the final decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Monmouth County, that, following a plea, convicted defendant of one count each of first degree kidnapping and second degree endangering the welfare of a child, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:13-1a and 2C:24-4a, respectively. On appeal, defendant challenged the kidnapping conviction and the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant abducted a six year-old female child from in front of her home for the purpose of holding her for ransom, and kept the child in his mother's home, until abandoning his plan and dropping her off in front of a mall. The only harm suffered by the child was emotional and psychological in nature in the form of a post-traumatic stress disorder. There was no contention in this appeal that the victim was released in an unsafe place. Defendant contended that the child's post-traumatic stress disorder did not constitute &quot;harm&quot; under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:13-1c. Although defendant's abduction and treatment of the child was not especially terrifying or dangerous, as a young child, she was particularly vulnerable, and the emotional harm that she sustained was substantial. She suffered severe anxiety, nightmares, and an inability to socialize; she worried that she would be captured again. She was also harmed, despite the delayed manifestation of her symptoms. However, the judge's conclusion that there was a risk that defendant would commit another offense, his prior record, and lack of cooperation, were only relevant to the kidnapping charge, and not to the crime of endangerment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded for the trial court's identification of those aggravating and mitigating factors that were supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was civilly committed to a New Jersey Department of Corrections (DOC) treatment facility as a sexually violent predator pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4-27.24-.38, challenged a DOC policy that required periodic random searches of the residents' rooms. He sought a declaration that the policy was unconstitutional. He also sought injunctive relief and damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the search was conducted pursuant to a DOC policy that required staff to randomly search at least two residents' rooms per day during the first and second shift. He also alleged that his room had been searched previously pursuant to the policy. Defendant was committed involuntarily to a state-run hospital because of illness and not as part of a criminal sentence. In that position, defendant could not be denied his right to be free of unreasonable searches merely because he did not own his surroundings. However, the fact that defendant was civilly committed as a sexually violent predator, in a facility exclusively occupied by patients who had been similarly committed, heightened the State's legitimate interest in conducting routine searches. For the protection of staff and other patients, and to further the therapeutic goals of the facility, the unit administration had a need to thoroughly inspect the patients' living areas to ensure that they did not have contraband, including but not limited to drugs, pornography, weapons, or means of escape. Defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy from routine, non-targeted searches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff township residents sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Passaic County, which upheld, with modifications, a grant by defendant township planning board of preliminary and final site approval for construction of a self-storage facility by defendant storage company. The company cross-appealed the trial court's order that prohibited storage of commercial goods in the facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents were shareholders in a similar facility in the township. They asserted that the proposed facility was a commercial storage warehouse that was prohibited by the zoning designation for the property. The planning board ruled that the self-storage facility was a permitted use for the property. The trial court agreed. The court affirmed in part, holding that (1) because the planning board did not have authority to hear a challenge to their interpretation of the zoning ordinance, the residents lacked standing to make that challenge before the board, but they did have standing to challenge the proposed use of the property; (2) the self-storage facility was not a warehouse and the fact that it might store goods or be operated at a profit did not transform the facility into a commercial storage warehouse, thus, the trial court correctly concluded that the proposed facility was allowed under the township's zoning ordinance; but (3) there was no evidential basis in the record upon which to limit storage in the facility to non-commercial uses, and the trial court's order limiting the facility to non-commercial storage was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order recognizing the operation of the self-storage facility as a permitted use under the zoning ordinance was sustained. Its limitation on the nature of goods that could be stored in the facility was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Somerset County, convicting defendant of third degree distribution of a controlled dangerous substance in violation of N.J.

Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges resulted from a routine undercover drug operation in which a detective purchased drugs from defendant within 500 feet of a public housing facility. Defendant testified at trial that another undercover officer was the purchaser of drugs. That undercover officer, however, disagreed. Defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 3:18-2 was properly denied. There was sufficient evidence to support the conviction. Defendant and the undercover officer testified that defendant sold cocaine to an undercover officer. Even if defendant sold cocaine to a different undercover officer, there was still sufficient evidence for the convictions. Defendant's motion for a new trial pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 3:20-1 was properly denied. Defendant and his co-defendant were admitted drug users. Furthermore, defendant admitted selling drugs to an undercover officer. There was no due process entrapment as asserted by defendant. Although the informant was provided with a specific plan, it was defendant who authored the basic idea for the crime. The police did not use excessive inducements or repeated requests or persistent solicitation in the face of unwillingness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city commenced a condemnation action against defendants, a motel and others, to effect a partial taking of a strip fronting the motel as part of a redevelopment plan and to widen two roads. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County held as a matter of law that fifteen parking spaces in the strip had been lawfully created and properly utilized, and a jury returned a verdict for two million dollars. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The most dramatic impact of the taking was the elimination of fifteen parking spaces, which the city contended were never approved in the first instance. The court disagreed and affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held, inter alia, that (1) the motel was entitled to damages for the loss of the spaces because unlike the situation in Faps, while vehicles had utilized the State-owned right-of-way to maneuver out of the parking spaces, the taking caused the loss of the parking where it encompassed the spaces themselves; (2) the evidence supported the finding that the motel received approval for the front parking spaces when it received approval for an expansion, and, thus, Linden, N.J., Code &sect; 31-36.1 applied and protected the motel's use of the parking spaces; (3) the use of the spaces was grandfathered under the Access Code, N.J. Admin. Code &sect; 16:57-1.1; (4) the city was equitably estopped from arguing that no approval was given for the spaces because they fronted the motel's property on a major highway for approximately 30 years; and (5) the trial court correctly denied the city's motion for a new trial on the basis of willfully false testimony by a witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted interlocutory review to an appeal by plaintiff judgment creditor from a summary judgment of the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Camden County (New Jersey), holding that the creditor could not redeem, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:5-54, a tax sale certificate, sold to defendant certificate holder, on property originally owned by defendant judgment debtor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By the time of the appeal, the case was mooted by the creditor's acquisition of title to the subject property and redemption as a matter of right, but the appeals court proceeded on the merits, holding that the underlying issue had substantial importance and was capable of repetition while evading review. The creditor had expended tremendous resources to safeguard its interest in the debtor's property, but it had not bothered to acquire the tax sale certificate, as it could have. When it nonetheless attempted to redeem the property against the certificate holder's interest, the appellate court agreed with the trial court that the plain intent of the legislature, in strictly limiting the persons permitted to redeem property, was to prevent the possibility of redemption by third parties and make tax certificates appealing investments, thereby enabling municipalities to recover tax deficiencies with less difficulty. The creditor could not claim entitlement to equitable subrogation when it had taken no steps to place itself in the debtor's shoes. Since ample notice had been provided, as required by statute, there was no due process violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator was driving a vehicle that was involved in a collision with the man.

Ann. &sect; 39:6A-2(k), which defined &quot;economic loss&quot; to mean uncompensated loss of income or property or other uncompensated expenses including, but not limited to, medical expenses, plaintiffs' claim was barred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developers sued defendants, a township and a planning board, in the Burlington County Superior Court, Law Division (New Jersey), challenging adoption of an affordable housing ordinance. The state council on affordable housing was made a defendant in the case. The trial court found the ordinance invalid and granted the developers' partial summary judgment motions for builder's remedies. The council appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developers claimed the township's zoning was exclusionary and they objected to its plan to meet its duty to provide affordable housing. The appellate court held the developers had to exhaust administrative remedies as (1) the township submitted itself to the council on affordable housing's (COAH) jurisdiction, (2) the nature of COAH's jurisdiction, its discretion and expertise, and legislative intent made waiver of exhaustion improper as COAH was working with the township, and (3) the developers were denied leave to appeal. The trial court unrealistically strictly applied N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:27D-319 to relieve the developers of their duty to exhaust administrative remedies because review and mediation before the COAH was not done in six months, especially as they contributed to the delay. A failure to schedule mediation on the developers' second objection to the township's plan did not require automatic application of &sect; 52:27D-319. The COAH did not patently violate a ministerial duty. The trial court improperly asserted jurisdiction, as the appellate court had exclusive jurisdiction to review state administrative actions, under N.J. Ct. R. 2:2-3(a)(2) and 2:2-4.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because inmates had a protected liberty interest in &quot;good time&quot; credits, an offender's credits could not be reduced pursuant to N.J.

The prisoner claimed that he relied on his privilege against self-incrimination in the context of a then-pending appeal, and based on his continued claim that he was innocent of the crime. The appellate court held that the privilege against self-incrimination did not expire until exhaustion of direct appellate remedies. The Department claimed that the privilege against self-incrimination was totally inapplicable once the prisoner was convicted, even though he was appealing that conviction. The Department also claimed that the prisoner was not penalized for asserting his privilege against self-incrimination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed an order of the Tax Court (New Jersey), which granted summary judgment to defendant, the Director of the Division of Taxation, and dismissed the taxpayer's claims for a refund of net operating losses (NOLs) that were transferred to the taxpayer from a predecessor corporation in a bankruptcy reorganization. The court had remanded the case after the adoption of the Business Tax Reform Act (BTRA), 2002 N.J. Laws 40.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a successor through merger and claimed its predecessor's NOLs. The trial court held for the Director. On remand, the trial court found that the adoption of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-4.5, as part of the BTRA, merely codified the applicable law under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-4(k)(6) and made no change to state law regarding the carryover of NOLs, which was that carryovers could only be taken by the actual corporation that sustained the losses. The trial court also held that the new statute's application was not unconstitutional as applied in the case. On appeal, the taxpayer acknowledged that it could not prevail if the new BTRA controlled. The court held that the Corporation Business Tax Act, as amended by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-4.5, codified the same rule that applied since the adoption of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-4(k)(6) in 1985. There was no substantive difference in any of the language, and so long as the interpretation was consistent, there was no legitimate issue of retroactivity. Hence, there was no constitutional or due process concern. Moreover, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-4.5 was not special legislation or in violation of the separation of powers clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of New Jersey remanded the instant appeal to the court with a limited mandate for the court to reconsider its conclusion that defendant was entitled to have a jury determine whether a firearm he possessed was an &quot;assault firearm.&quot; At issue was N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to an offense and the court originally concluded that defendant's intent in possessing an alleged assault firearm was to use it unlawfully against the person of another.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-6, thereby warranting imposition of a 10-year parole ineligibility period. The supreme court then remanded the case for reconsideration in light of new case precedent. The court held that a finding that defendant possessed an &quot;assault firearm&quot; in the commission of an offense specified by the assault firearms statute increased the maximum penalty for the offense by imposing a 100 percent parole ineligibility period, and for that reason the finding had to be made by a jury under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. In so holding, the court cited precedent by the supreme court and a similar analysis under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 924(c)(1)(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the denial by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County, of his motion to dismiss, following his conviction upon a plea agreement of Medicaid fraud and misconduct by a corporate official.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:21-9(c)'s proscription against corporate criminal misconduct was unconstitutionally vague as applied to individuals other than corporate officers and directors. The appellate court held that &sect; 2C:21-9(c) applied to all persons in a position to use, control, or operate a corporation. To apply &sect; 2C:21-9(c) only to officers and directors, would render &sect; 2C:21-9(a), (b) redundant. The ejusdem generis canon of statutory construction did not require a different result. Defendant's claim that &sect; 2C:21-9(c) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him was rejected, as there was no guessing as to whether defendant's conduct was criminal under the statute, which provided adequate notice of its scope and informed persons of ordinary intelligence that the conduct to which defendant pled guilty was prohibited. The statute did not violate the single object rule, as the title provided sufficient information and notice of the statute's content. Defendant's claim of an excessive sentence was without merit, as it was based on the complexity and duration of the Medicaid fraud scheme, which far exceeded the elements required to prove the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a final order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Sussex County, which, following a trial de novo on her appeal from a municipal court, found her guilty on separate complaints of violating Sparta, N.J., Township Code &sect;&sect; 11-1.3, 11-5.3 by allowing the feeding of migratory wildfowl on her property. The fines imposed on defendant were reduced and were deemed as &quot;running concurrent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sent abatement notices after continued complaints were made that she or someone at her location was feeding waterfowl in violation of Sparta, N.J., Township Code &sect; 11-5.3. It was alleged that defendant's long-term houseguest hand-fed Canadian geese, and further that food had been spread on defendant's lawn for the birds. On defendant's appeal from her convictions, the court held that defendant's conviction under Sparta, N.J., Township Code &sect; 11-1.3 was deemed merged into the conviction under Sparta, N.J., Township Code &sect; 11-5.3 based on the multiple punishments theory. There was no facial constitutional violation under the vagueness doctrine, and further, given the unambiguous written notices provided to defendant, enforcement of the provisions survived as an applied challenge. Defendant's involvement in causation was reasonably found given evidence of migratory wildfowl feedings at and from defendant's property. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that the subject code provisions had been preempted by federal wildlife protection statutes and regulation because there was no indication that Congress intended to preemption of local public health laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County, convicted defendant of, inter alia, third degree possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-5, and second degree possession of a firearm while committing a designated drug offense, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-4.1. The trial court merged the convictions, and sentenced defendant. The State appealed and defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the State improperly impeached a defense witness with his pretrial sentence. The witness had testified that defendant's arrest was unjustified, and the prosecutor asked the witness a series of questions about why he had not contacted anyone about the allegedly improper arrest. While the State conceded that a proper foundation for such questions was not laid, and defendant did not object to the cross-examination, the appellate court found that the cross-examination at issue did not clearly cause an unjust result. The trial judge instructed that defendant could be convicted under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-4.1, if the jury found that defendant possessed a gun while in the course of possessing a controlled dangerous substance or possessing a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute. Simple possession of a controlled dangerous substance was not one of the drug offenses enumerated in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-4.1. Thus, the judge's charge was erroneous. Erroneous instructions on material points were presumed to be prejudicial, and incorrect charges on substantive elements of a crime constituted reversible error. The error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 30:4-27.24 to -27.38.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition seeking appellant's commitment under the SVPA, despite the fact that appellant had only one month remaining on his three-year sentence for failure to register as a sex offender. The trial court granted the application and ordered appellant committed. Appellant brought an appeal, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The court rejected appellant's contention that people committed under the SVPA were entitled to additional constitutional protections than those afforded by the SVPA because there was no right to a jury trial, the SVPA did not violate equal protection, the level of proof at clear and convincing rather than beyond a reasonable doubt was proper, and the statute was civil and was not punitive so double jeopardy and ex post facto issues were not relevant. Moreover, the record amply supported the decision since appellant's sexual assault was a predicate offense, his pedophilia and personality disorder were well documented, and his predictably dangerous nature was not mere suspicion. Finally, hearsay evidence was properly admitted under N.J. R. Evid. 703 where it supported expert testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured person sued respondent insurance company, seeking uninsured motorist benefits for personal injuries. After liability was established in arbitration proceedings, a jury in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County, returned a verdict that the injured person was not entitled to a monetary award. The injured person appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury had been instructed, without objection, that all eight jurors would deliberate and that agreement by six would be sufficient to return a verdict. The jury's determination was made by a six to two vote. The appellate court found that since the record contained no discussion of the issues of the number of jurors or the number required for a verdict prior to the verdict and certainly no indication of the parties' consent, the case was submitted to the jury in a manner inconsistent with N.J. Ct. R. 1:8-2. However, since the injured person did not object until after the verdict was returned, she was not entitled to reversal unless she was able to satisfy the plain error rule under N.J. Ct. R. 2:10-2. The appellate court found that N.J. Ct. R. 1:8-2 implemented N.J. Const. art. I, para. 9, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2B:23-1b, and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2B:23-17. A six to two verdict in a civil case may have been agreed to by the parties, and thus the injured person was not allowed to rely on the plain error rule due to her failure to object in a timely manner to submission of the case to the jury on the basis of the instruction allowing a six to two verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, Law Division, Essex County (New Jersey), that convicted him on jury verdict of robbery. He argued on appeal that plain error mandating reversal occurred when his confrontation guarantee under N.J. Const. art. I, para. 10 was violated by a prosecutor's statement that defendant's presence during testimony of other witnesses enabled him to tailor his testimony to theirs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested as the driver of the car in which a robber (who was not caught) escaped the scene of a purse snatching. He testified in his own defense, and in the summation, a prosecutor reminded jurors that defendant, testifying last, had an opportunity to assure that his testimony accounted for all the facts recounted by other witnesses. Noting that it had been provided with no reason to hold that N.J. Const. art. I, para. 10 did not provide the same confrontation protections as the Sixth Amendment, the appellate court referred to applications by the United States Supreme Court of the Sixth Amendment, in which it had held that a defendant who waived his right to remain silent subjected himself to the same attacks on credibility to which any other witness was subject. The challenged remarks in a closing statement had not directly attacked defendant's exercise of any constitutional protections, and, further, the jury had been instructed not to regard anything said in closing as evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prosecutor sought review from a decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Union County, which denied classification of an inmate as a sex offender under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:7-2, also known as Megan's Law, based on a prior kidnapping conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted in 1983 of multiple offenses, including kidnapping, arising from a failed attempt to escape an armed robbery of a store. One hostage was a woman and the other was a 13-year old female, but there was no sexual contact. During the time that he was incarcerated, Megan's Law became effective. After his parole, the prosecutor sought a designation of the inmate as a &quot;Tier Two,&quot; or moderate-risk offender, which was denied by the trial court. On appeal, the court found that Megan's Law did not apply to one who did not commit any type of sex offense. Nor was the Registrant Risk Assessment Scale applicable, as use of it immediately imposed at least a Tier One rating, which went beyond the legislative intent of &sect; 2C:7-2 and could have raised constitutional issues. The court noted that based on statutory construction, common sense, and most importantly, the legislative intent in enacting Megan's Law, the inmate was not the type of offender to whom it applied, as there was no conviction or charge against him involving a sexual offense. Further, the court noted that New Jersey was in compliance with the Jacob Wetterling Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 14071, through Megan's Law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general partnership bought the subject land after the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:9B-1 to 13:9B-30, was enacted, but before its July 1, 1988 effective date. The general partnership bought the subject land to build, and did build, a retail center on the land. The general partnership's application to build an addition to the retail center on the site was denied because it was ruled that the addition would unjustifiably eliminate freshwater wetlands remaining on the site. On appeal, the court found that the statutory criteria under the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act for the issuance of permits were not constitutionally vague because the general terms used sufficiently directed the administrative agency's action. Further, the Commissioner's findings of fact and conclusions of law were not arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable because there was considerable evidence of practicable alternatives to the proposed project that would have permitted some additional building without encroaching on the wetlands.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the municipal court for violating a municipal ordinance prohibiting the maintenance of a public nuisance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allowed the branches of trees on her property to overhang and obstruct a public sidewalk. She refused to cut the tree branches for several months following her convictions for violating East Windsor, N.J., Mun. Code 18-3.1, &sect; 2.1(a), (b), and she received additional summonses, which remained outstanding. In her appeal, defendant argued that the municipal ordinance of which she was convicted was unconstitutionally vague and vested unbridled discretion in municipal officials. The Law Division judge concluded that the language of the ordinance, taken together with the procedure providing for specific notice, satisfied due process requirements. On appeal, the court found that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. Both subsections set forth unascertainable standards that encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Its unconstitutionality was not cured by the fact that it required offenders to receive a notice of violation before a summons was issued. Because the ordinance denied defendant due process of law, her convictions were reversed and her fines were returned.</SPAN></P>

The State did not have to offer a certified map to prove the school zone location. The nature of the second DWI offense determined the applicable sentencing provision. Because a DWI offense in a school zone was a more serious offense, an enhanced sentence was appropriate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant distributed and possessed child pornography that he posted to and received from the Internet on his home computer. One of defendant's defenses at trial was that the images were not of real children, but rather, were either of dolls, were virtual images, or were morphed characters. The trial court gave corrective instructions to the jury to correct statements in the prosecutor's summation regarding the status of the images, and defendant was found guilty. On appeal, the court initially found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:24-4b(5)(a), (b) had to be construed, based on Free Speech Coalition, to cover only images of real children. The court found that the trial court did not properly instruct the jury that the prosecution had the burden of proving that the images were of real children, and that virtual images were not a crime. The corrective instruction was not detailed enough to avoid the violation of defendant's right to a fair trial. The court also held that requiring sex offender registration was improper, and that the jury was properly instructed as to the age presumption and proof required pursuant to &sect; 2C:24-4b(6).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner filed a tax appeal which challenged his property tax assessment for several tax years. The tax court entered judgment in the owner's favor, which reduced the assessment for that period of time. That judgment was affirmed and the municipality sought further review. While that application was pending, the owner sought to compel a refund by the municipality of the excess taxes, together with interest thereon, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:3-27.2. The tax court denied the application, finding that the municipality's right to appeal was to be exhausted prior to any payment being issued. The owner challenged the constitutionality thereof. The court found that there was no conflict with N.J. Ct. R. 2:9-5, and that the judgment reducing the assessment had not been stayed. However, withholding issuance of a payment until such time as appeals were exhausted was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Cape May County, granted plaintiff innkeepers summary judgment, declared portions of Cape May, N.J., Ordinance 1214-2000 unconstitutional, and ordered defendant city to create a separate bank account in which to deposit beach tag fees. The city appealed. The innkeepers cross appealed the order dismissing their challenge to the city's budget and the denial of counsel fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:61-22.20, cities bordering the Atlantic Ocean could charge the public for access to their beaches. Under Cape May, N.J., Ordinance 1214-2000, &sect;&sect; 8-2, 8-7(a), innkeepers could not transfer seasonal beach tags, and only five such tags could be purchased per person. Thus, the innkeepers could no longer buy seasonal tags for their guests. The trial court struck down the five-tag limit and the transferability ban on equal protection grounds. The appellate court held that the distinction in the ordinance respecting transferability between innkeepers and the public was arbitrary; a stated purpose of this provision was to raise sufficient revenue to cover costs, but the provision lacked rationality because it would not further this admittedly legitimate government interest. The trial court erred in striking down the five-tag restriction, as it improperly shifted the burden to show the ordinance's rationality to the city, and the innkeepers presented no evidence of the provision's irrationality, thus failing to meet their burden to prove unconstitutionality. The innkeepers were not entitled to attorneys fees, as no statute or rule authorized such an award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed insofar as it declared ordinance provisions banning the sale and transfer of seasonal beach tags to the lodging industry unconstitutional. The order was reversed insofar as it struck down ordinance provisions limiting the sale of seasonal beach tags to five per individual. The order requiring the city to account for expenses and maintain a separate bank account was reversed. The denial of counsel fees was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In Mount Laurel litigation brought by plaintiff citizens, defendant township appealed from a judgment and orders of the Superior Court, Law Division, Union County (New Jersey) that denied its motion to remove a special master, denied its motion to delete one of respondent developer's zoning sites from its compliance plan, and granted the developer's motion to enjoin the township from acquiring the site by eminent domain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mount Laurel litigation arose out of municipalities' obligations under the New Jersey Fair Housing Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 42:27D-307 to -329, to provide their fair share of affordable housing. Despite the existence of administrative processes through the New Jersey Commission on Affordable Housing, the municipality pursued court proceedings over nearly 15 years. The same special master handled the case all that time, even after a developer involved in other projects on which he had consulted became involved. The appellate court held that strict conflict of interest rules applied to special masters just as to judges, and that the judge should have been removed. Since his findings had not affected the trial court's rulings, no remand was required. The township acted beyond its powers in seeking to change zoning to eliminate the profitable part of the developer's project, but it should have been allowed to acquire the property by eminent domain since, in that case, the developer would have received the same fair market value that the property had when the development was contemplated. The developer was entitled to relief from the original terms of a settlement with the township.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed denial of the motion to delete the site, as well as the denial of permission to transfer the proceeding to an administrative agency, but reversed the portion of the order that enjoined eminent domain acquisition as well as the portion that denied the motion to remove the special master.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the victim and his wife, filed a personal injury suit against defendant amusement park owner. The park owner moved to dismiss the complaint, as plaintiffs had failed to comply with the notice provisions of the Carnival-Amusement Rides Safety Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5:3-31 et seq. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Cape May County, granted the motion and denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim claimed, while riding on a roller coaster on August 22, 1998, the ride stopped abruptly, causing his head to jolt back and forth. As he was unaware of his injury at the time, he did not report the incident and did not file an accident report. Later that evening, he was admitted to the hospital where doctors determined that he had suffered a stroke. On May 28, 1999, one of his physicians issued a letter stating that his stroke was due to the dissection of the right vertebral artery due to the trauma on the roller coaster. The appellate court held that plaintiffs failed to file a written notice within 90 days and never asked for an extension of time to file that notice. In fact, they never filed the required notice at all. The first notification the park owner received was the service of the amended complaint two years later. Further, even giving plaintiffs the benefit of the application of the discovery rule, their complaint was untimely. The correct analysis of the operation of the discovery rule had to be judged from the date on which the victim's treating physician alerted him to the connection between the injury and the roller coaster ride.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The training and racing licenses were suspended by the racetrack's board of judges for various charges against appellants. The Commission referred the matters to the ALJ, whose initial decisions found that the Commission had failed to prove the charges. The Director of the Office of Administrative Law granted extensions of the 45-day statutory period for rendering a decision. The Commission thereafter rejected the ALJ's decision and reinstated the suspensions, although the final decisions were not issued for seven months in one case and a full year in the other. On further appeal, the court reversed the suspensions, holding that the ALJ's decisions were &quot;deemed approved&quot; when the Commission failed to issue final agency decisions within the time prescribed by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:14B-10(c). The court found that the Commission's failure to act within the time period constituted &quot;inexcusable negligence&quot; and &quot;gross indifference&quot; to its responsibilities, and there was no need to show prejudice in order to use the &quot;deemed approved&quot; provision.

The trial court did not consider that defendant's second statement was evidence of other crimes or bad acts under N.J. R. Evid. 404 because the bad acts were by other people. The evidence was relevant to show defendant's state of mind in agreeing to participate in an armed robbery, and the statement was not too remote.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the patient argued that her complaint should have been preserved because of the allegedly fraudulent maintenance of relevant records, her substantial compliance with statutory directives, and the existence of extraordinary circumstances.

She neither served an expert's report nor an affidavit demonstrating compliance with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:53A-28 and explaining why such service was not possible. Further, she provided no adequate reason for her noncompliance. In addition, there was no basis for the patient's claim that the doctors' delay in production of their office records in any fashion affected her ability to timely produce an affidavit of merit. The office records upon which the patient relied in claiming extraordinary circumstances were non-essential to her demonstration of malpractice. Thus, the patient failed to demonstrate circumstances that were sufficiently extraordinary to relieve her of her statutory obligations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee brought an intentional wrong tort claim against an employer and a joint employer for the amputation of three fingers, which was settled during litigation. The carrier asserted its compensation lien pursuant to N.J. Stat.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the employee was entitled to pursue both a workers' compensation benefits remedy and an intentional wrong tort litigation action. However, the carrier was entitled to assert a lien under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:15-40 for reimbursement of compensation benefits paid. The employers were considered to be the equivalent of &quot;third person&quot; tortfeasors within the scope of &sect; 34:15-40. Further, the court found that if the employee were allowed to keep the benefits and the settlement proceeds, it would constitute a double recovery, which was prohibited.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate challenged the judgment entered, claiming that the treatment program violated his self-incrimination rights under the Fifth Amendment. The appellate court held that because the treatment program could require an inmate to disclose incriminating information, the statutory scheme invaded the inmate's liberty interest. Without providing some type of use immunity, the State could not do such at the expense of loss of freedom through a longer prison term. The State was also prohibited from extracting information about an inmate's past criminal history, not the subject of a conviction, under penalty of loss of good time and work credits. Finally, a reliance on the inmate's right to claim a privileged communication under the psychologist and client privilege or the pertinent regulations relating to confidentially of inmates' records did not trump his self-incrimination privilege. On remand, the inmate could not be docked otherwise available credits solely because of his claim of privilege. However, he could not avoid participating in and cooperating with an otherwise non-incriminatory treatment program simply because he asserted a claim of privilege.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Camden County, convicted defendant of fourth-degree aggravated assault on a police officer and fourth-degree resisting arrest and sentenced him thereon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions, contending that: (1) the complaint was improperly executed; (2) the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the requisite mental state required for each of the charges; and (3) imposed an excessive sentence. The appeals court first found no merit in the claims alleging a defective complaint and challenges to the constitutionality of the statute authorizing officials to act for the court. However, the trial court erred in the jury instruction as to the requisite mental state of &quot;purposeful.&quot; For the two charges, the State was required to prove that it was defendant's conscious object to cause bodily injury to an officer, and to prevent his arrest. While the trial judge correctly advised the jury that it had to determine that defendant had the purpose to cause bodily injury to a police officer, the judge then added his own gloss on the definition which contrasted &quot;purposeful conduct&quot; with &quot;accidental conduct&quot; without defining any of the levels of culpability in between. Thus, the trial judge diluted the culpability requirement necessary to establish the purposeful element of both aggravated assault and resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, retired police officers, sued appellees, the State and the police retirement system, in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County (New Jersey), challenging an amendment to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43:16A-7, a provision of the laws concerning the police retirement system. The trial court granted summary judgment to the State and the police retirement system. The retired police officers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officers had taken accidental disability retirement and received a pension funded by the police retirement system. The officers challenged an amendment to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43:16A-7 (1998) which enhanced retirement benefits for officers who retired on or after April 1, 1991. On appeal, the court found that the amendment to &sect; 43:16A-7 separated a uniform group of persons receiving accidental disability retirement pensions into two classes, those who retired prior to April 1, 1991, and those who retired on or subsequent to that date. Because it was rational for the New Jersey Legislature to limit a prospective benefit in order to further the legitimate interest of preserving the fiscal integrity of the fund, the amendment to &sect; 43:16A-7 did not violate the guarantees of equal protection. Further, the amendment was not special legislation as the amendment did not exclude a class of persons upon whom it would otherwise operate. Finally, the amendment did not violate the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 12131-12132, as the officers failed to demonstrate a causal connection between their status as disabled persons and the statutory distinction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, then a juvenile, was tried as an adult in 1987 and was convicted of murder and aggravated sexual assault. He sought post-conviction relief on grounds that the version of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:4-2 in force at the time of his trial was unconstitutional and prevented his counsel from asserting a diminished capacity defense. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Ocean County, denied him relief, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When he was 15, defendant sexually assaulted and murdered a 13-year-old girl. One of defendant's experts opined that he suffered an isolated explosive disorder; another, that he suffered from an atypical psychosis. The State's expert disagreed, opining that defendant had an antisocial personality disorder. Based on these experts' reports, defendant's trial counsel did not pursue a diminished capacity defense, as she felt she could not prove a mental disease or defect by a preponderance of the evidence, as required by the then-extant version of &sect; 2C:4-2. After defendant's conviction, Humanik held that the burden-shifting portion of &sect; 2C:4-2 was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that Humanik required full retroactive application, as it corrected structural error in the trial process. The procedural bars of prior adjudication ( N.J. Ct. R.3:22-5) and the five-year limitations period (N.J. Ct. R. 3:22-12) did not preclude consideration of the petition, as the claim was substantial and needed to be addressed on the merits. On remand, defendant had to show the burden of proof requirement in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:4-2 discouraged use of the diminished capacity defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for a plenary hearing to allow defendant the chance to prove that he could have presented a triable jury issue on diminished capacity, if allowed to do so at trial. The assignment judge was to designate a different trial judge for the evidentiary hearing on the admissibility of evidence and the ultimate decision on defendant's right to post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a driver and spouse, sued defendants, the employer and employee, for injuries sustained in an auto accident. Defendants moved for summary judgment under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6A-4.5, because the driver's vehicle was uninsured. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hudson County, denied the motion on grounds that &sect; 39:6A-4.5 was unconstitutional. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver alleged that his vehicle was sideswiped by a bus owned by the employer and operated by the employee. The driver claimed serious injuries. However, his insurance had lapsed, and under &sect; 39:6A-4.5 he could not, for that reason, recover damages from defendants. The trial court ruled that &sect; 39:6A-4.5 violated the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. The appellate court analyzed &sect; 39:6A-4.5 under the New Jersey Constitution, and found that its total abrogation of the common-law right of a seriously injured uninsured driver to pursue a tort remedy violated the state constitution's equal protection and due process guarantees. The abrogation of an uninsured driver's right to sue for personal injuries did not bear a real and substantial relationship to any of the recognized goals of tort reform. Further, it was arbitrary for the legislature to permit suits by uninsured drivers seeking property damage, while barring such drivers from pursuing any cause of action for serious personal injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother asked her physician for advice when she became pregnant soon after having her previous child. She claimed afterward that he convinced her to have an abortion by frightening her about potential kidney damage without fully disclosing other ramifications of abortion, which, in the mother's case, were considerable, in part because the physician also carried out the abortion in an incomplete and apparently negligent manner. The appellate court agreed that under a rational basis analysis, the wrongful death statute did not violate the equal protection rights of mothers of deceased unborn children by not providing a right of recovery for their loss. The focus of that statute was on allowing recovery for dependency and pecuniary loss. This limitation did not leave mothers of unborn children without a remedy, however, because the court held that New Jersey's common law cause of action for emotional distress caused by the loss of a child, based on the existence of an intimate familial relationship and the foreseeability of parental suffering, easily extended to circumstances involving unborn children, as a corollary to an action for wrongful birth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed dismissal of the wrongful death claim but reversed dismissal of the common law tort claim, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Concerned about student drug use, a high school established a program of random drug testing for students who held parking permits or who participated in extracurricular activities. The parents who challenged the policy on constitutional grounds conceded that the program passed muster under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution as articulated in the Earls decision, but argued that the similarly worded state provision, N.J. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, provided broader privacy protection. The appellate court held that while the New Jersey provision was interpreted more broadly in case law involving criminal defense issues, the case law involving student drug testing did not differ from the federal standard. Although the program was not unconstitutional, the appellate court directed the trial court on remand to consider the parents' additional claims that the school had exceeded its statutory powers to implement drug control programs under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:40A-1 et seq. and N.J. Admin. Code tit. 6, &sect; 29-6 et seq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Monmouth County, denied intervenor judgment creditor the right to intervene in an action to foreclose tax sale certificates. The court also denied the creditor's motion to vacate an order setting the time for redemption on grounds the creditor lacked standing. The creditor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge found that intervention was barred because the creditor acquired a property interest for consideration; thus, it had no standing to oppose the final judgment. On appeal, the issue was whether the circumstances of said acquisition contravened public policy and barred a right of redemption. The appeals court first held that the orders did not resolve all issues as to all parties. The creditor acquired its various interests after the filing of the complaint to foreclose the right of redemption. Before the motion judge ruled on the creditor's constitutional challenge, the creditor enhanced its position by executing on the judgment and obtaining title through a judicial sale without informing the trial judge of its change in status. It also initiated actions to acquire the interest of the other tenant in common. Thus, it altered its position from judgment creditor to owner. The appeals court thus imposed a constructive trust on the creditor's interest in favor of the tax complainant who sought to bar redemption. The creditor's attempt to &quot;end run&quot; the foreclosure proceeding and avoid the adverse rulings governing its prior attempts to intervene was barred by statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Albeit for different reasons and with the exception of the constructive trust imposed, as modified, the judgment was affirmed and the cause was remanded to the general equity judge for entry of an amended final judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the New Jersey Racing Commission, ordered appellant race horse owners to return purse monies won by their horses that were under the supervision of a trainer who, unknown to them, was under a suspension in New York State and thus was also ineligible to participate in the races in New Jersey. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trainer was suspended for 15 days in New York State after horses he trained tested positive for illegal chemicals. Under N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13, &sect; 71-1.10, the horse trainer's out-of-state suspension was to be given &quot;full force and effect&quot; by New Jersey. Neither the Commission nor the owners were aware of the trainer's suspension at the time of the races at issue, but the Commission held that strict liability attached. The appellate division held that, while in certain instances -- such as the presence of drugs or foreign substances in the horse -- knowledge by the owner of a wrongdoing by a trainer might be irrelevant, only the trainer knew of his out-of-state suspension and there was scant opportunity for the owners to obtain such knowledge. The procedures used by the trade association and the state agencies failed to make information about suspensions available in a timely manner. Under the circumstances, basic principles of procedural due process and fundamental fairness militated against the imposition of such a sanction against the owners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent New Jersey Casino Control Commission revoked appellant casino officer's key employee license and invalidated a proposed severance agreement between the officer and the casino. The officer sought review of the invalidation of the severance agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of his compulsive gambling, the officer's retention of his key employee license was conditioned on his refraining from gambling and obtaining counseling. His license was later revoked, not because he was a gambling addict, but because he lied about his gambling and his failure to attend counseling, and did not report gambling winnings to the I.R.S.; this showed he lacked good character, honesty, and integrity. The Commission rejected the officer's and the casino's joint application to approve the severance agreement, because it found that paying him $ 750,000 for not working in an industry from which he was barred would violate public policy and would be contrary to the purposes of the Casino Control Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. 5:12-1 to -210. The court agreed. It held that: (1) N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5:12-104b authorized the Commission to reject the severance agreement; (2) substantial evidence supported the ruling; (3) impairment of the officer's contract rights was outweighed by the policies of the Act; and (4) the severance agreement was not a disability benefits plan under the Employee Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1001 to -146, so there was no ERISA preemption.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hudson County, granted defendant-intervenor United States' motion to intervene, and ordered the counties to disclose specified information pertaining to certain inmates. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In connection with the federal terrorism investigation spurred by the September 11 attacks, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) agents detained certain persons for alleged violations of federal immigration law. Some of the detainees were housed in the counties' jails pursuant to the counties' contracts with the INS. After the trial court ruled that New Jersey statutes mandated the release of certain information about these detainees, the INS enacted 8 C.F.R. &sect; 236.6, which forbade state or local governments from disclosing INS detainee information. The instant court held that the United States was properly allowed to intervene, as all four prongs of the N.J. Ct. R. 4:33-1 test were met. 8 C.F.R. &sect; 236.6 preempted all New Jersey statutes in conflict with it, as (1) Congress had exclusive authority over immigration matters; (2) the Attorney General delegated power to the INS to enact the regulation under 8 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1103(c); (3) the INS' non-compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act's, specifically 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 553, rule-making procedures was excused by &quot;good cause&quot; under 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 553(b)(B), (d)(3); and (4) the regulation did not violate the Tenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Borough of Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, Zoning Board of Adjustment refused to allow plaintiff wireless telephone service providers variances to construct a tower on property leased from a local volunteer fire company.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court determined that volunteer fire companies had the power to lease their real property pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15A:3-1(a)(5) to entities engaged in profit-making activities. The appeals court analyzed 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to determine a test defining the extent to which a local zoning authority (BZA) could regulate the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities in view of the &sect; 332(c)(7)(B)(i)(II) preemption. In their de novo review of a BZA decision, courts had to consider whether the proposed providers proved (1) the area was not being served by another wireless provider, (2) the proposed facility was the least intrusive means to close the gap in service, (3) they had made a good faith effort to identify and evaluate less intrusive alternatives, and (4) further reasonable attempts to build a facility to fill the gaps in service would likely be fruitless and a waste of time.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the television newsmagazine set out to do a racial profiling story, it recruited several young black men to ride around a small town in an expensive car. When police stopped the car for a minor infraction, all the passengers were ordered out of the car and searched. Tapes of the stop were included in the broadcast, during which a law professor commented on the illegality of the search. The appeals court agreed that the officers could not maintain a defamation action against persons associated with the newsmagazine. The court did not reach the issue of actual malice, because it agreed with the professor that there was no consent justifying the search. The officers could not maintain a civil action under the New Jersey Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:156A-1 to -34, because they had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the car they were searching as they were recorded. Finally, the police could not recover damages for fraudulent news gathering, because the newsmagazine was not spying on private matters, but observing public officials in the performance of their duties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspaper sought access to certain investigation reports of respondent police department concerning allegations of wrongdoing by the city road department. The allegations of wrongdoing were the subject of a presentment returned by the Cumberland County Grand Jury. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Cumberland County, dismissed the complaint on summary judgment. The newspaper appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the newspaper argued that it had a statutory right of access to the investigatory files pursuant to the New Jersey Right-to-Know Law (RTKL), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1A-1 to -4, because the documents constituted &quot;public records&quot; within the meaning of that statute. Also, the newspaper argued that the trial judge erred in rejecting its claim for access to the investigation reports under the common law right to know. Finally, the newspaper contended that the trial judge erred in concluding that the newspaper's interest in the reports was outweighed by the need for confidentiality. The appellate court agreed with the determinations of the trial judge and concluded that: (1) criminal investigation reports were not public records under the RTKL, (2) the investigation reports and the grand jury testimony were inextricably related and could not be separated for purposes of a common-law right to access analysis, and (3) the policy of confidentiality underlying the filing and return of a grand jury presentment outweighed the public's right to know the details of the investigation.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Essex County, entered summary judgment in favor of the principal and the lender. The worker and the assignee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The worker and the assignee's assignor worked for a subcontractor on a public project. The complaint contended that the principal, as surety under the bond, was responsible for the wages due. A cross claim was filed against the lender. The trial court found that the failure of the worker and the assignee to file their claims against the principal's predecessor within one year from completion of their work on the project precluded the action pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:44-146. The appellate court held that the current requirement contained in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:44-145, that plaintiffs provide written notice to the contractor that they were beneficiaries of the bond prior to commencing any work, came into effect after the worker and the assignee's assignor had already completed their work on the project. The legislature could not have intended that the 1996 amendment to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:44-145, measuring the one-year limitation period from the date of completion of the work, be applied to prevailing wage claims on public works projects based upon work completed prior to the effective date of the amendments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Cape May County, ordered judgment interest on severance damages to defendant landowner from the date of a taking. Plaintiff city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented was whether a condemnor in a partial taking case was entitled to an abatement of interest on the condemnation award for the fair rental value of the remainder of the property even though the condemnee was deprived of beneficial use of the acquired property as of the date of taking. The trial court concluded that the landowner was entitled to interest from the date of the taking because such deprivation impaired its use of the remainder and the award of interest was intended to compensate for that impairment. The court of appeals agreed. The landowner was not left undisturbed in its enjoyment of the property. When the city filed its action, it also filed a declaration of taking of the easement and started work on a beach preservation project that resulted in the landowner's loss of an ocean view from a first-floor apartment, loss of direct access to the beach, and infringement of its occupants' privacy. Thus, even though the landowner continued to enjoy the beneficial use of the property, this enjoyment was diminished by the city's construction activities, and the severance damages represented the fair value of this diminution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer paid the insured benefits for injuries arising from an automobile accident. He was a member of the board of directors of the provider who treated him. The insurer sought to examine him under oath, under his contractual obligation to cooperate. A grand jury was investigating the provider and the insured for insurance fraud, and he declined to be examined, asserting his privilege against self-incrimination. The appellate court held the privilege applied to a &quot;proceeding&quot; or &quot;action,&quot; N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:84A-19, N.J. R. Evid. 503, and the examination the insurer sought was not within this protection, as there was no state-imposed choice between remaining silent and risking a protectible &quot;important interest.&quot; The insured's obligation to cooperate was pursuant to a private contract, and he had no blanket privilege to refuse to comply with that obligation. It was not clear that any questions the insurer might ask related to the grand jury proceeding.

The ordinance led to uniformity throughout the zoning district and did not give the borough control beyond its power. Because the ordinance fell within the scope of the general enabling provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 55D-1 to -129, it was not statutorily infirm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Criminal Part, Passaic County, convicted defendant of aggravated manslaughter, 2 counts of possession of a handgun with purpose to use it unlawfully against others, and 10 counts of receipt, purchase or acquisition of a handgun without a permit. Defendant was acquitted of murder. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State produced no evidence that the guns defendant possessed had been purchased, acquired, or received in New Jersey. Defendant testified that he had obtained the weapons in Florida, and that he had a Florida firearm license. The appellate court held that the weapons-permit charges needed to be dismissed for a lack of proof of an essential element: that the guns were purchased, acquired, or received by defendant in New Jersey. To the extent New Jersey law forbade the importation weapons or required that they be registered upon entry, the indictment did not charge any such violations. The appellate court also held that the trial court erred when it excluded defendant's family and other spectators from the courtroom during jury voir dire. Defendant was not required to prove specific prejudice to obtain relief for a violation of his public trial guarantee. There was no showing that the jury selection process was likely to be prejudiced by the presence of the families and other spectators in the courtroom. Reasonable alternatives to closure were available such as instructing the spectators not to mingle with the jurors. The closure was substantial, rather than de minimis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress was affirmed. The convictions on counts one through four of the indictment were reversed and remanded for a new trial, on the lesser-included aggravated manslaughter in count one and the crimes charged in counts two, three, and four. The convictions on counts 5 through 14 were reversed and the charges were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant welfare recipient class sued appellees, state welfare department and commissioner, in the Essex County Superior Court, Law Division (New Jersey), regarding N.J.

The trial court granted appellees' summary judgment motion, and the class appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class argued that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:10-61a&nbsp;unconstitutionally interfered with a woman's right to choose to have children. The appellate court held the statute was rationally related to the legitimate state interests of altering the cycle of welfare dependency as well as promoting individual responsibility and family stability. There were no constitutional implications when the state did not pay a benefit to parents who had a child that it would not pay to parents who did not have a child. The statute's cap on welfare benefits did not substantially interfere with a woman's right to have children; she could still bear children, albeit without an additional cash subsidy. The failure to provide a cash benefit upon the birth of an additional child did not impair a woman's reproductive rights to any significant degree. Significantly, the family would receive Medicaid coverage and food stamps for an additional child. The statute's constitutionality did not rest on its effectiveness as long as it served a legitimate primary purpose and had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant animal rights activists sought review of various decisions of respondent New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Fish, Game, and Wildlife, Fish and Game Council, regarding the constitutionality of deer management legislation,&nbsp;N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Animal activists challenged a series of regulatory and legislative actions undertaken in New Jersey to address the problem of overpopulation of white-tailed deer. Many of the actions challenged had been mooted by the time of the instant appeal by expiration of permits and the enactment of comprehensive legislation, codified at N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 23:4-42.3 to -42.8, and implemented by N.J. Admin. Code tit. 7, &sect; 25-5.32. The court held that the statute authorizing community-based deer management plans that could include the killing of deer in appropriate cases was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority, because it contained adequate standards to guide the fish and game agency in the exercise of its function. Although previously issued permits were moot issues, the court addressed one issue as likely to recur, holding that when the agency approved or disapproved a deer management plan or an application for designation as a deer management area, it had to provide a statement of reasons for its action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the legislative and administrative action, but imposed one requirement on the agency's exercise of its functions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Monmouth County, final judgment ordered forfeiture of $ 3,910 found secreted in the trunk of a vehicle owned by claimant owner, who had previously pled guilty to a criminal drug charges after the vehicle was stopped and impounded; the vehicle; and $ 700 in the passenger compartment of the vehicle. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner did not argue that the passenger compartment search, after the officer smelled raw marijuana after his speeding stop and the owner signed a consent to search the compartment, was improper. The $ 3,910 was discovered by accident at the police impound when a state officer searched the car's trunk and the money fell out of a shoe. The appeals court analyzed caselaw, starting with the United States Supreme Court in Cooper, to reject decisions (primarily federal) which granted an unfettered right to search under these circumstances, sometimes under the guise of safety considerations, and instead determined that in New Jersey searches of vehicles impounded in contemplation of forfeiture were to be judged by the rules governing inventory searches. The appeals court viewed Cooper as sanctioning no more than a routine inventory search. The instant search appeared to comply with departmental procedures, so it did not appear to be a subterfuge for a warrantless investigatory search. The search, however, was fatally flawed since an inventory search could not be undertaken without giving the claimant the option to consent or to make other plans to safe-keep his property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court reversed the judgment, held the $ 3,910 had to be suppressed, and remanded the case for a determination as to whether forfeiture of the $ 700 and the vehicle were subject to forfeiture without consideration of the illegally seized currency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff daughter sued defendants, including a city, its welfare and development departments, mayor, and council members, and landowner, after she discovered and viewed lands in 1997, formerly an active cemetery where her father was buried, being used for disrespectful purposes. She appealed Superior Court of New Jersey, Essex County, Law Division orders dismissing her claims for, inter alia, intentional and emotional distress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The old cemetery land, now bordered by a beer factory, was partly used over the years by a railroad, as a sewer line route, for parking, and as a dump, and was partly paved. A newspaper reported human bones being unearthed. The elderly daughter traced her father's 1921 burial to an inexact location in the indigent portion of the cemetery. The daughter claimed emotional injuries after viewing the site. The appeals court determined, after an analysis of several New Jersey statutes and cases, that the daughter did not have a property right to her father's remains after burial and so was not deprived of due process. The daughter did not have a private right to bring a claims under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 8A:8-3, 40:60-41. The city's arguable infractions occurred more than 50 years previously. The court rejected the grave desecration and emotional distress claims primarily for a lack of showings of intent, recklessness, duty to her, proximate cause, and medical expenses. The landowner did not own the land in 1997. The council members had immunity. Grave public policy interests were resolved by an ancillary chancery decision requiring the city to build a memorial park on the lands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the orders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from Superior Court, Law Division, Camden County (New Jersey), plaintiff man challenged the consequence of retroactive federal legislation on state law as to enforcing the maximum age limit of 35 on defendant municipality in its hiring of law enforcement personnel. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the judge granted defendants' motions and denied the man's motion for partial summary judgment. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that summary judgment was properly granted dismissing the complaint against all defendants. Due to the retroactive nature of a revitalized provision, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 623(j) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 621 et seq., hiring restrictions in the ADEA based on age for police and fire officers were permissible in April and August 1996. When 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 623(j) was active, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:14-127 became valid. New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination (LAD), N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 et seq., afforded man no discrimination remedy because LAD specifically authorized classification based on age in certain circumstances, including the restrictions on the age for hiring police officers. Thus, man could not recover. The motions for summary judgment were properly granted. The record was not unequivocal as to whether the man sought to be considered for a full-time police officer position during the disputed time periods by either filling out a new application or conveying to anyone his interest in this post. Hence, he would not have been entitled to summary judgment on his motion in any event.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An Atlantic County Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, judgment, after a plea bargain, convicted defendant of non-capital murder, sentenced him according to the bargain to life in prison, with 30 years of parole ineligibility, and imposed a $ 1,000 victim (VCCB) assessment, a $ 75 SNSF assessment and a $ 30 training (LEOTEF) assessment. Defendant appealed an order denying his motion to suppress and the VCCB assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stabbed victim was defendant's former girlfriend. A motel owner told investigators defendant checked out the day before, had changed his appearance by shaving his mustache and darkening his hair, and had left a bag in his room when he checked out. The owner's private action brought the bag to the investigators in the motel office. The investigator unzipped the bag without a search warrant and found pants with the victim's bloodstains. Defendant was arrested when he returned to the motel. The appeals court said the search of the bag was not valid under the private search doctrine, since the search exceeded the scope of any invasion of defendant's privacy by the motel owner and his employees, or by the investigator without a search warrant, unless the circumstances of the search fell within an exception to the warrant requirement. An investigator's authority to possess a package was distinct from his authority to examine its contents. The exigent circumstances exception did not apply. Remand was made for findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the State's abandonment exception argument. The LEOTFF assessment was enacted after the offense occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court vacated the order denying defendant's motion to suppress, remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings in conformity with the appeals court's opinion, vacated the LEOTEF assessment, required the trial court to make necessary findings with respect to the VCCB assessment, and retained jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VIII, para. 1, &sect; 4, the New Jersey Department of Education's (DOE) decision to adopt its regulations promulgated pursuant to the New Jersey Supreme Court's directives in two cases designated Abbott V and Abbott VI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The regulations were originally codified at N.J. Admin.

The supreme court had held that the Comprehensive Education Improvement and Financing Act of 1996 was unconstitutional as applied to school districts that served children in poor districts and that were classified as special needs districts, then ordered the state to provide increased funding to the 28 &quot;Abbott&quot; school districts and to implement additional funding to further the students' ability to achieve at the level prescribed by core curriculum content standards adopted by the DOE. Abbott V explained necessary remedial measures and ordered the DOE to promulgate the regulations. The legislature adopted expediting legislation. Abbott VI addressed preschool issues. The DOE then adopted the amended regulations. The court addressed the alleged regulation deficiencies, compared the regulations to Abbott V and VI directives, and decided the DOE's actions in adopting the regulations did not violate the enabling act, were supported by substantial evidence, and were not clearly erroneous in applying legislative policies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county community college filed an action against defendant, Warren County (New Jersey) Board of Chosen Freeholders (Board), seeking an order requiring the Board to fund construction of a college community center. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, ordered the Board to fund construction and held two members of the Board in contempt when they failed to do so. The Board and the two Board members appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county community college's board of trustees adopted a resolution proposing construction of a community center and forwarded their resolution to the college's board of school estimate. The board of school estimate voted to approve construction and forwarded their recommendation to the Warren County (New Jersey) Board of Chosen Freeholders, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:64A-19(2), to obtain funding. However, two of the three people who comprised the Board opposed the project and they rejected a resolution appropriating funds to pay the costs of preparing a bond ordinance. When the Board failed to act, the college obtained a court order compelling the Board to proceed with the process of issuing bonds and the same court held two members of the Board in contempt when they failed to comply with the court's order. The appellate court held that (1) N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:64A-19(2) was unconstitutional as applied to Warren County (New Jersey); (2) Warren County (New Jersey) Community College was not lawfully established as a county college under state law; and (3) the trial judge improperly applied N.J. Ct. R. 1:10-2 in holding the Board's members in contempt of court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment and vacated the trial court's contempt order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A marriage committee concluded that the inmate and non-inmate were not good candidates for marriage. A prison administrator accepted the recommendation. The appellate court held that security concerns ordinarily could justify denial of a request for permission to marry only if an inmate desired to marry another inmate. A penological interest in rehabilitation could not be invoked as a justification for excessive paternalism in reviewing an inmate's request for permission to marry. The appellate court held the decisions of the marriage committee and administrator did not identify any security or rehabilitative concerns that could justify the denial of the request for permission to marry. Although the inmate and her intended spouse might have entertained an unduly optimistic view of the inmate's prospects for early release, this was common among inmates and did not provide a basis for denying the right to marry. The committee's conclusion that the couple did not have an established relationship that would warrant marriage represented excessive paternalism unrelated to a prison's legitimate security and rehabilitation concerns.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator's decision was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the department to make appropriate arrangements for the marriage.</SPAN></P>

The cases were consolidated and an administrative law judge concluded that the company was bound by the 80-ton limit and assessed penalties in favor of the DEP and the county. The appellate court held that the company knew that the permit was conditional and had a duty to inquire further. Because there had already been a hearing on penalties and the company received the due process to which it was entitled, there was no benefit to setting aside penalties that were not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found the evidence against defendant was overwhelming. Words like &quot;horrific&quot; and &quot;despicable,&quot; in describing the abuse she inflicted on her son, seemed inadequate. Defendant's argument she should have been prosecuted on a different, lesser charge was rejected. The prosecutor had discretion to proceed under either of two overlapping statutes. Defendant's argument that it was error to admit evidence of five years of earlier abuse she committed on the same child, for which she was not charged, was rejected, as it showed her motive, intent, plan, and knowledge, as well as the absence of mistake or accident. Additionally, the evidence was material, it was very similar to the charged abuse, the evidence was clear and convincing, and the trial court's finding that its probative value outweighed potential prejudice was a reasoned decision. The jury was cautioned about its consideration of the evidence for improper purposes. Although the trial court should have specified the purposes for which the evidence could be considered, the failure to do so was harmless. Defendant's argument that her sentence was excessive was rejected, and required little discussion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Overwhelming evidence established defendant's possession of a firearm with intent to use it in robbing his former place of employment.

Looking to limitations on the Apprendi holding, and to New Jersey case law interpreting the Graves Act, the intermediate court held that it was not its place to impose novel constitutional requirements, and affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. It strongly suggested, however, that trial courts err on the safe side by obtaining a special verdict on Graves Act issues.</SPAN></P>

Defendant received a nine-year prison sentence for the interference with custody conviction and a concurrent five-year term for the prior conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under a custody agreement incorporated into a divorce consent judgment, defendant had joint custody of her minor children with their father, and weekly rotating physical custody. Formal written modification or waiver was permitted. Though no written modification occurred, one child eventually lived only with the father and another lived with defendant, who took the latter child to Peru without informing the father. Defendant argued on appeal that the trial court erred in the jury instructions regarding her taking of the child from the father's custody and that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:13-4 was overly broad. The appellate court held that the trial court committed reversible error by not relating the law to the facts in the jury instructions, particularly regarding whether defendant's taking of the child deprived the father of parenting time under the custody order; whether the father had waived those rights by his conduct; or whether the couple had modified the agreement by their conduct. Section 2C:13-4 was not overbroad; it specified a narrow range of acts that constituted interference with custody and did not substantially interfere with a parent's right to rear a child.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the transferee was an indispensable party since the franchisee could not adequately represent its interests. The injunction maintained the status quo and allowed the franchisee an opportunity to mitigate its losses. The franchisers provided no credible reasons for refusal. The transferee was an experienced automobile dealer and character allegations were unproven.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Law Division, Bergen County, New Jersey, convicting him of second-degree eluding and related offenses, arguing most prominently that jurors should not have been instructed that they could infer intent from traffic violations and that his sentences violated the Apprendi rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving a car that fled police in a long chase that gave rise to many traffic charges as well as more serious charges, especially eluding police pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:29-2b. Although defendant failed to preserve several appellate issues, the appeals court reviewed his argument that since the trial court, rather than the jury, determined his guilt of traffic violations, the jurors should not have been allowed to infer from his alleged traffic violations that he knowingly placed others at risk by his driving. The appeals court held since the jurors were fully instructed regarding the elements of the charged traffic offenses, they had the information needed to determine for themselves whether drawing of the inference was appropriate. Imposition of an enhanced sentence did not violate the Apprendi rule, because the enhancement was based entirely on recidivism.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A secretary in her local school system was connected by marriage to an active political family. At some point in her employment, her family and the family that allegedly controlled the school board had a falling out. She was first transferred to an assignment for a supervisor she did not get along with, and eventually terminated when her position was eliminated from the school board's budget. While the reviewing court agreed that the circumstances of the employee's firing were somewhat suspicious, it agreed that she failed to allege facts that stated a prima facie case of employment discrimination. At the one point when a termination would clearly have been politically based, the school board eventually retained her. The employee also could not make out a private cause of action under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:27-4.1. That statute simply guaranteed public employees an informal hearing on their terminations, which she received.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee was awarded permanent disability by the New Jersey Department of Labor, Division of Workers' Compensation, for a carpal tunnel condition as a result of conditions he was exposed to at work for respondent employer. The employer appealed from the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer argued that the employee's waiver of New Jersey Workers' Compensation Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:15-7 et seq., coverage complied with the act's applicable provisions. The court found that accepting the employer's theory that such an election could be fashioned unilaterally to eliminate sections of coverage and apply to only targeted workers could create obvious unfairness and confusion. There was sufficient basis in the record to support the compensation judge's finding that the attempted election was invalid because the notice was unclear and the employee did not understand its meaning. The notice did not define &quot;compensable occupational diseases&quot; or what was meant by references to arts. I, II of the act. Employees were told they would be fired unless they signed the notice. The employer also argued that an election notice could be issued at anytime from hiring up to the date the employee manifested any occupational disease, and thus could be issued after an employee had been exposed to an occupational hazard. The court determined that an election had to occur prior to occupational exposure rather than disease manifestation for the process to be valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant became disruptive at a public city council meeting. He refused to sit down even after the mayor threatened to call the police. When the police arrived, he refused to leave quietly.

The superior court upheld only the defiant trespass conviction. The appellate court held that the police acted reasonably. They did not initially arrest defendant, but directed him to leave the premises. His refusal to leave constituted defiant trespass. He was warned that arrest would be the consequence of his continued refusal to leave. The offense did not turn on whether he had actually been disruptive, but on his defiance of the police officer's direction given in the lawful course of the officer's employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Chancery Division, Mercer County (New Jersey) entered an order declaring New Jersey's voter affiliation scheme, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 19:23-45, 19:31-18.1, unconstitutional because it denied respondents, organizations and members, equal protection by unnecessarily burdening their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to political association. An appeal was filed by appellants, state, attorney general, and committees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint of the organizations and the members challenged the primary election process, candidate ballot placement, the composition of the election board and poll watchers, fundraising, and other regulatory matters, as they affected minor or alternative political parties. On appeal, however, the appellate court focused on whether the inability of a registered voter to declare an affiliation with an alternative political party infringed upon the rights of expression, association, and equal protection of the organizations and the members. The appellate court balanced the nature of the burdens imposed on the organizations and the members, the severity of the burdens, and the state's justification for these burdens, and held that the failure of the legislature to recognize that alternative parties were entitled to the same opportunity to have their followers declare their affiliation, and to have the county commissioners of registration maintain and disseminate this information to alternative parties on the same terms as the committees, constituted an impermissible burden on the First Amendment rights of the organizations and the members and denied them equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff partnership filed suit seeking compensation after the agency directed that land owned by the partnership was designated a wetland. The partnership contended that the designation as a wetland constituted a taking by the State. The trial court held the partnership's taking claim was moot, and that there would be no basis for finding a temporary taking based on administrative delays. The agency appealed, and the partnership cross-appealed. The appellate court found that the agency's approval of a plan to ameliorate a regulatory taking claim must be made in accordance with regulations adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52:14B-1 to -15. Further, the trial court's determination that the partnership's property had been taken, ignored fundamental regulatory taking principles. Finally, the trial court's finding that the delay in the application process was not extraordinary was amply supported by the evidence. Thus, there was no compensable temporary taking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court was affirmed as to the determination that there was no temporary taking. The case was remanded to allow the agency an opportunity to develop and adopt new rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted to using his semi-automatic rifle to fire several shots into the house of his former girlfriend in order to scare her. He agreed to plead guilty to a weapons charge in exchange for other charges being dismissed. Because the trial court determined defendant used a weapon substantially similar to listed assault weapons, he was sentenced to an enhanced sentence under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-6g. The appellate court concluded the trial court correctly found defendant possessed a firearm with the purpose of using it unlawfully against a person. It also concluded the assault firearms statute, 1990 N.J. Laws ch. 32, was not unconstitutionally vague and did not deprive defendant of equal protection of the law. However, to preserve the constitutionality of the assault firearms statute under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the jury trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, it required the determination of whether a firearm was substantially identical to one of the firearms enumerated in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-1w to be made by a jury under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.</SPAN></P>

The owners association and individual members sought to invalidate the ordinance on grounds of equal protection or due process violations. The appellate court found that the trial court properly determined that Belmar, N.J., Ordinance 1999-16, was constitutional, was not selectively enforced, properly imposed liability on all tenants for occupancy violations, did not constitute a taking, did not impose punitive fees, and did not violate the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3601 et seq. The trial court erred in declaring certain provisions of Belmar, N.J., Ordinance 1999-16, invalid, including portions that prohibited temporary certificates of inspection for summer rentals, the use of flammable materials as partitions, and commercial signs and strings of lights on summer rentals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking a judgment declaring the Small Business Set-Aside Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 52:32-17 to -31, and various regulations contained in the New Jersey Administrative Code unconstitutional. The trial court granted plaintiffs' summary judgment motion, holding that the authority's MBE set-aside program violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, &sect; 1, and permanently enjoined the authority from utilizing its set-aside program. On appeal, the authority argued the trial judge erred in determining that the set-aside provisions in question were not narrowly tailored. In response, plaintiffs contended the set-aside program was not narrowly tailored because it was overinclusive as to covered minorities, failed to use race-neutral means, and had no sunset and periodic evaluation provisions. The appellate court concluded the authority's set-aside program could not withstand the strict scrutiny analysis set forth in Croson because it was not narrowly tailored to achieve its intended result. Specifically, the appellate court observed it was overinclusive as to the minorities who could benefit from the program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a former Roman Catholic seminarian, sued defendants, diocese and priests, claiming he was persistently subjected to unwanted homosexual advances during his eight to nine years of seminary training, and that this constituted a breach of contract for education. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint. The seminarian appealed the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former seminarian claimed he spent $ 69,000 and 10 years and did not have a meaningful career because his teachers and mentors behaved sexually inappropriately towards him. The former seminarian did not seek reinstatement, but sought money damages for his loss of time and out-of-pocket costs. The appellate court held that entertaining plaintiff's action would have violated the First Amendment's Religion Clauses, as the action would have required the courts to intrude into church polity and administration, and would have generated excessive entanglement of church and state. The former seminarian argued that resolution of the dispute would not have involved excessive entanglement, and that neutral principles of law could be applied to adjudicate his claims. The appellate court found no express contract. The appellate court found that the former seminarian, in effect, asked the courts to imply a contractual relationship between a priest-in-training and the diocese. The appellate court concluded that such an undertaking involved inquiry into the seminary's training program and legal monitoring of religious aspirants' and their peers and superiors' sexual proclivities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Jersey Legislature enacted the Comprehensive Educational Improvement and Financing Act of 1996 (CEIFA), N.J.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 18A:7D-1 to 18A:7D-3, governing state aid for public education were unconstitutional as applied to special needs districts. As a result, the New Jersey Department of Education reduced state aid to a school district from $ 2,445,907 to $ 645,851 for school year 1997-98, and from $ 2,955,107 to $ 710,439 for school year 1998-99. The appellate court held that (1) the commissioner did not violate the New Jersey Administrative Procedure Act and regulations adopted thereunder by not referring the school board's petition to the OAL; and (2) in its Abbott decision, the Supreme Court of New Jersey declared that the QEA funding formula was unconstitutional only insofar as it failed to assure parity of regular education expenses between special needs districts and more affluent districts and, because the petitioner school district was not a special needs district, it could not claim rights under that decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Jersey Educational Facilities Construction and Financing Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:7G-1 et seq., authorized a state agency to use a technique called contract bond issuance to raise revenue for constitutionally mandated upgrades in inner-city schools. The challengers, an individual and a taxpayer group with which he was associated questioned the use of contract bonds, under this and other statutes, as violative of N.J. Const. art.

The appellate court held that it was bound by a long case law tradition that found no violation of the debt limitation clause so long as the state's credit was not directly pledged in support of the bonds. Even though the ability to pay off the bonds depended upon continuing legislative appropriations, the scheme was not unconstitutional because the statute explicitly disclaimed state liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beach where defendant was arrested for violation of an ordinance forbidding female toplessness had a long history of nudity and efforts to eliminate it. The appeals court upheld the trial court's conviction of defendant. First, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague, because it was clear what conduct was prohibited, and there was no constitutional right to go naked. Second, it did not violate equal protection principles under either the federal or the state constitution, because the ordinance treated the sexes differently based on real physical differences, and the protection of societal sensibilities was a sufficient governmental interest to justify it. This was a minimal intrusion on the liberties of defendant, who had the option to patronize private beaches. Finally, while New Jersey's articulation of the public trust doctrine protected public access to beaches, this did not mean that a municipality could not reasonably restrict use and enjoyment of beaches.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of failing to exhibit a driver's license and disorderly conduct. On appeal, the appellate court concluded that nothing in the factual complex permitted a conclusion that defendant failed to display his driver's license or that he engaged in disorderly conduct. The appellate court noted that nothing in the evidence would support a claim that the officer had an articulable suspicion of illegal conduct to support a Terry stop. Moreover, the actions of defendant and his testy exchange with the officer had no capacity to cause public inconvenience, public annoyance, or public alarm. The appellate court observed that the entire incident was an unfortunate example of a police officer overreacting to innocuous conduct and a citizen treating an officer with rudeness approaching insolence that only aggravated the situation. Finally, as to the alleged violation of N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a joint trial, the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County, found defendants guilty of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:21-21c(4), a provision of the New Jersey Anti-Piracy Act. Defendants were sentenced to probation for five years and fined. Additionally, one defendant filed a motion for acquittal, which was denied. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State troopers stopped a speeding minivan and noticed a videocassette box with the title of a film, which was currently in movie theaters. Defendant driver admitted that he had about 1,000 videocassettes and that he knew they were illegal copies. On consolidated appeal, defendants asserted that &sect; 2C:21-21c(4) was unconstitutionally vague due to its failure to define &quot;manufacturer&quot; and that the judge's charge defining &quot;manufacturer&quot; was erroneous. The appellate court held that the statute was not vague or ambiguous. Further, the jury instruction, in the context of the case, could not have caused confusion since the evidence showed unequivocally that (1) none of the audiovisual works were authorized, (2) most of the films had not been legally released in videocassette form, and (3) none contained a name and address of any videocassette manufacturer. Additionally, the evidence was sufficient to warrant conviction as it supported the inference that defendant passenger was in constructive possession of the pirated videotapes. He was knowingly involved as the 10 boxes of videos were in plain view. Finally, the evidence was sufficient for imposition of the fine.</SPAN></P>

Appellants filed separate appeals which were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee's child attended a public school and was evaluated as needing speech therapy. Thereafter, the parents decided to educate the child at home. They requested appellee school board provide speech therapy to their child and were willing to bring him to a public school to receive the therapy. However, because the child was being educated at home and not at a &quot;public&quot; or &quot;nonpublic school,&quot; and based on a directive issued by appellant DOE, appellants denied him the therapy. The appellate court held education at home did not fit the definition of a &quot;nonpublic school,&quot; or were speech therapy services mandated for children who were home schooled under federal or state statutes. In addition, the DOE did not engage in rule making in violation of the New Jersey Administrative Procedure Act, specifically N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:14B-1-15. The differentiation between the treatment of nonpublic school students receiving speech therapy benefits and a home-schooled child was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States or New Jersey State Constitution. However, appellee's child was denied equal protection because they agreed to take him to the public school classes.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 11A:6-10 and 40A:14-77 required public employers to give paid leave to delegates to attend conventions of various organizations. The trial court found the statutes unconstitutional as special legislation. On appeal, firemen argued that: (1) fire department lacked standing to challenge the statutes, (2) the statutes were entitled to a presumption of validity, and (3) even if the statutes were unconstitutional, the trial court should have severed the offensive portions, thereby salvaging the statutes. Fire department argued that the trial court erred in not also finding the statutes an improper delegation of legislative authority. The appellate court found that fire department was not restricted from challenging state legislation under the state constitution. Further, fire department was directly affected by the legislation and had standing to challenge its constitutionality. The appellate court found that the statutes failed to provide adequate standards and safeguards to guide a public employer and other organizations in the exercise of their discretion to determine the number of delegates to which the local fire departments must provide convention leave.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found: (1) that applying ch. 73 retroactively did not deprive appellant of any vested right, nothing in the record indicated that retroactive application resulted or would result in harsh or oppressive consequences violating appellant's due process rights, and it did not impose a manifest injustice; (2) the law did not constitute special legislation, as the law's purpose was clearly expressed and there was nothing unreasonable in the classifications established, which were reasonably related to achieving an appropriate legislative objective; (3) appellant failed to demonstrate that he was a member of a suspect class or that ch. 73 infringed upon a fundamental right; and (4) were the court to adopt appellant's argument, almost every constitutional attack upon legislation would require the judiciary to determine the state of mind of individual legislators.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that he was a valid office holder. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Warren County, reinstated plaintiff as county counsel, with back pay, nunc pro tunc, and rescinded defendant's resolution to appoint another as county counsel. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An election changed defendant's composition to a Republican majority. Defendant, while Democrats were still in majority, appointed by resolution plaintiff as county counsel for a three-year term. A week later defendant, with its Republican majority, rescinded by resolution the employment agreement and appointed another as counsel. Plaintiff sued and won. The appellate court overruled Pillsbury v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of Monmouth County, 140 N.J. Super. 410, 356 A. 2d 424 (App. Div. 1976), which held that county counsel could not be removed without good cause. Defendant, under N.J. Ct. R. Prof. Conduct 1.16, could discharge plaintiff before the end of his statutory term, and there was no special exception for county counsel.  N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:9-25, providing for county officers' termination only for cause and not for political reasons, gave way to Rule 1.16, on the right of clients to discharge counsel, to the extent &sect; 40A:9-25 intended to govern the attorney-client relationship. The New Jersey Supreme Court had exclusive and plenary authority regarding the practice of law.</SPAN></P>

The reliability of actuarial instruments to predict the future dangerousness of sex offenders whose offenses were committed as juveniles was not addressed in the lower court. Because the testimony regarding petitioner's actuarial scores was ambiguous and incomplete, the matter was remanded for an evidentiary hearing about the admissibility of actuarial instruments. The State failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that petitioner was likely to commit future sexually violent acts, because the evidence was based upon actuarial instruments that were not admissible as to a juvenile offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition for the civil commitment of appellant under the SVPA. The petition was accompanied by clinical certificates of involuntary commitment certifying that appellant was a violent sexual offender who suffered from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which made him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined to a secure facility for control, care, and treatment. The trial court concluded that appellant had been convicted of a sexually violent crime, was suffering from a mental abnormality or personality disorder, and was likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for treatment. Thus, appellant was committed to the special offenders unit. The appellate court held under the SVPA, a person could be deemed to have a mental abnormality that resulted in his inability to control his dangerousness in one of three different ways, an emotional impairment, a cognitive impairment, or a volitional impairment and any of those would be grounds for commitment. It held the SVPA was constitutional because it narrowed the class of persons eligible for confinement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Passenger was in a car driven by her insured father when she was injured in an automobile accident. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment concluding that the passenger failed to satisfy the statutory verbal threshold. The appellate court agreed. The statute required automobile insurance policyholders to make an election of tort options. One of the options exempted automobile owners from tort liability where the policyholder or members of his immediate family residing in his household were required to maintain coverage. Children were included in the statutory definition of immediate family. The definition was not limited to minor children. It was undisputed that the passenger's injuries were covered by her father's policy regardless of her age. Therefore, she was subject to the statute and could not look to defendants for recovery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the six-year limitation period of N.J. Stat.

Ann. &sect; 12A:3-118(b) (amended 1995) did not apply because New Jersey law favored prospective application of statutes, the &quot;curative exception&quot; to the rule of prospective application did not apply as the new legislation was not merely curative but was a substantial revision of prior law, and the note had been executed prior to the effective date of the amending legislation; (2) because the statute of limitations in effect at the time the note was executed ran before the action was filed, the action was time-barred and the trial court correctly granted the debtor summary judgment; and (3) there was no need to consider whether a letter the FDIC sent the debtor would have constituted a demand to start the running of the statute of limitations of N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurers were regulated by defendant New Jersey insurance agency. They did not write automobile insurance in New Jersey, but pursuant to the New Jersey Good Driver Protection Act, N.J. Stat.

They challenged the statute as impairing contractual rights granted under an earlier statute and as violative of due process and equal protection rights. The court held, first, that the statute conveyed no contractual rights that the legislature could not later abridge in the public interest. The same shared interest in insurance industry stability also prevented other findings of constitutional violations and kept the law from being special legislation prohibited by N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, para. 9.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs claimed that the Comprehensive Education Improvement and Financing Act of 1996 (CEIFA), N.J. Stat.

I, para. 1, and its Thorough and Efficient Clause, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4, para. 1. The trial court found that the school districts lacked standing and that the plaintiff's claims were not viable. The appellate court held (1) the school districts lacked standing because political subdivisions of the state could not raise equal protection challenges to state action, the school districts failed to show a direct injury and were not members of any non-profit organization, and individual taxpayers were capable of suing on their own; (2) the equal protection challenge to CEIFA was not permitted because challenges to educational funding provisions were too unmanageable to be permitted, and, in any case, the claims were of questionable merit; and (3) because N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4, para. 1, was not intended to provide statewide taxpayer equality, the tax equality attack on CEIFA under that clause was not viable.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hudson County, held that plaintiff-respondent could not be barred from office. Intervenor-defendant-appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While mayor, plaintiff-respondent was convicted of 15 counts of mail fraud, wire fraud, false statements to a bank, false statements to the Internal Revenue Service, income tax evasion, and failure to file a tax return. After serving his sentence completely, plaintiff-respondent sought mayoral candidacy. The appellate court concluded that that each statutory provision independently barred his candidacy. The trial court erred in relying upon the fact that the criminal conduct occurred prior to plaintiff-respondent's taking office to determine that his offenses did not touch on his public office. What was determinative was that his convictions while in office demonstrated his untrustworthiness and disrespect for government agencies. Plaintiff-respondent's untrustworthiness and dishonesty &quot;touched on&quot; the office of mayor, thereby warranting permanent disqualification pursuant to &sect; 2C:51-2d. Accordingly, he was forever barred and disqualified from public office. The court also found that the Faulkner Act forfeiture provision, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:69A-166, was rationally related to a legitimate purpose. Thus, there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Cape May County convicted defendant of second-degree vehicular homicide, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-5a. The trial court then convicted defendant of driving while intoxicated and other charges that were reserved pending the vehicular homicide trial. The trial court imposed a three-year parole ineligibility term upon defendant. Defendant appealed the convictions and the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court considered all of defendant's arguments challenging the convictions, and found that none of the arguments had merit. Defendant also argued that the three-year mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutionally imposed because the fact of her intoxication at the time of the accident was not decided by the jury. The appellate court held that for the mandatory minimum sentence to be imposed under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-5b(2), the parole-ineligibility fact must be found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury. The appellate court held that the finding of intoxication was made by the trial court pursuant to a reasonable doubt standard. However, the fact that the judge found intoxication beyond a reasonable doubt did not mean that the jury either did or would have since it was free to attribute the fatal accident to speeding alone and there was evidence on which it could have found that defendant was not intoxicated. Consequently the constitutional guaranty of trial by jury to which the Johnson doctrine entitled defendant before a mandatory parole ineligibility term may be imposed was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the parole ineligibility term imposed, and remanded the case for modification. The convictions were affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were mothers of children who had been arrested several times for violating the curfew. The mothers had given their children permission to come and go from legitimate activities. Plaintiffs and the children had been ordered to do community service. Plaintiffs requested preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting further enforcement of the ordinance and a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The superior court found the ordinance was unconstitutional, and enjoined defendant from enforcing it. The appeals court affirmed. The ordinance was constitutionally deficient in two respects. First, the statutorily-mandated exceptions, fairly construed, were not broad enough to recognize the right of parents to permit their children to participate in many legitimate activities. Second, the exception language regarding cultural, educational, or social events was unconstitutionally vague. The ordinance's language did not give a clear standard as to what conduct was forbidden. The ordinance could not depend on broad discretionary subjective judgment calls by the police officers to decide which activities and which juveniles fell within the exceptions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the imposition of the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-7.2, in his guilty plea before the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant entered a guilty plea to a charge of second degree attempted burglary while armed with a firearm. The sentence was to be imposed under the provisions of NERA, which required defendants to serve a minimum of 85 percent of their sentence and a 5 year probationary period upon their release. In instituting the defendant's conviction and sentence, no hearing on the applicability of NERA was held, as was required by N.J. Stat. Ann &sect; 2C:43-7.2e. The appellate court held that the applicability of NERA was illegal because NERA required the defendant to have threatened the victim with a deadly weapon, and in the defendant's case, he merely possessed the weapon. No finding of fact was made that the defendant actually threatened anyone. The court held that the language of NERA had to be strictly construed and that there was no determination that the defendant did more than possess the weapon. The defendant did not knowingly waive the right to a determination that the NERA factors applied to his case; thus the appellate court reversed and remanded the case back to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed, among other things, that the zoning of property he had contracted to buy was arbitrary and capricious. The trial court improperly granted summary judgment for defendant on grounds that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge defendant's blight determination and redevelopment plan. Given the state constitutional foundation of the right to judicial review of administrative action, plaintiff's failure to file a written objection as provided by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:12A-6b(7), did not preclude him from challenging the blight determination. The trial court correctly concluded the blight determination was valid. But it erred in granting summary judgment against plaintiff's challenge to the part of the redevelopment plan which rezoned solely for residential use the property he had contracted to purchase for non-residential use. Defendant failed to produce evidence explaining why plaintiff's property was zoned as it was. Plaintiff presented an expert's report asserting the redevelopment plan created illogical land use patterns and was thus arbitrary and capricious, especially as it related to the zoning of the property plaintiff had contracted to buy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought an action against defendant, challenging the elimination of plaintiff's supervisory position in a city department of public works. The Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Bergen County found that defendant was precluded by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:14-65 from abolishing plaintiff's position for good faith economic reasons. Defendant appealed the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff joined defendant's volunteer fire department, and received a certificate of exemption pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40A:14-55 to 40A:14-59. Plaintiff was later employed as a laborer in defendant's department of public works, and was subsequently promoted to a supervisory position. In an attempt to cut costs, defendant eliminated plaintiff's supervisory position, but continued to employ plaintiff. On appeal, defendant argued the good-faith elimination of the position due to economic needs did not violate N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:14-65, and other errors. The court found that during the depression of the 1930's, courts interpreted the original version of the statute as allowing for discharge for economic need. The court found that a 1938 revision of the statute limited authority to abolish a position to two special circumstances, widespread depression or mandatory retrenchment. The court found the current version of the statute did not change this rule. The court held the trial court's construction of the statute did not render the statute unconstitutional under N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, p. 2, N.J. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3, p. 3, or N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, p. 9(13).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision, because the Exempt Firemen's Tenure Act prevented a municipality from making a good faith elimination of a position held by an employee with exempt fireman status, except in circumstances of widespread economic depression or mandatory retrenchment, and because the trial court's construction of the act did not render the act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Atlantic County Superior Court, Law Division (New Jersey), which convicted him, pursuant to a plea agreement, for third-degree possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, N.J.

On appeal, defendant argued the trial court erred in failing to merge the offense of possession with intent to distribute into the greater offense of possession with intent to distribute within 500 feet of a public park or place, and the sentence imposed by the trial court was an abuse of discretion in that it was manifestly excessive. The appellate court determined a third-degree &sect; 5 conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute merged for the purposes of sentencing with a &sect; 7.1 conviction for second-degree possession of cocaine with intent to distribute within 500 feet of public property. Additionally, the appellate court found no merit to defendant's argument that his ultimate sentence was excessive. Accordingly, the appellate court remanded the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of respondent Board of Review (board), New Jersey Department of Labor, which denied his claim for partial unemployment compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's claim for partial unemployment compensation benefits was denied because appellant was &quot;unavailable for work&quot; on the day he attended his brother-in-law's funeral. The denial was affirmed by respondent board. On appeal, appellant argued the compensation eligibility scheme under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 43:21-4, -19(q) violated his rights of free exercise of religion and equal protection under U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. The appellate court affirmed the decision, concluding appellant's free exercise claim was without merit. Further, although the appellate court considered the legislative scheme permitting funeral attendance to be too restrictive, the appellate court was constrained to follow the narrowly drawn statutory proscription. The appellate court reasoned there was no &quot;fundamental right&quot; to attend a funeral, or did appellant's status as a brother-in-law qualify him as a member of any &quot;protected class.&quot; Therefore, applying the rational basis standard, the appellate court found no viable equal protection claim, as the statutory scheme was rationally related to the objective and legitimate goal of limiting recovery of benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, public employees, brought breach of contract causes of action against defendants, public utility, members, and officers, after their employment was terminated and their five-year, fixed term employment contracts cancelled in an effort to combat increased operating costs incurred when it was determined that the State's solid waste management system discriminated against interstate commerce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee board conducted a hearing and evaluated the financial condition of appellant city. After hearing testimony, appellee board requested the state's attorney general file an application to obtain a judicial determination that gross failures by appellant substantially jeopardized its fiscal integrity. After such an action was filed, appellee board adopted a resolution placing appellant under its supervision pursuant to the Local Government Supervision Act of 1947, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:27BB-1 to -100. Appellee board then adopted a resolution directing appellee individual be appointed as appellant's new business administrator. Thereafter, appellant's city council, in defiance of appellee board's resolution, voted to approve its own selection of a business administrator, and not to appoint appellee individual. The trial court later enforced appellee board's order appointing appellee individual. Judgment was affirmed. The court found the strong remedial powers granted appellee board to correct gross financial failings at the municipal level prevailed over the general power of appellant's city council to appoint and confirm a business administrator, as in more normal circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 54:4-23.12a exempted from property tax certain &quot;single-use agricultural or horticultural facilities.&quot; The issue for resolution on remand was whether a portion of the taxpayer's two attached greenhouses enclosed a space used for working, office, or sales, so as to preclude the tax exemption otherwise provided to a facility of this nature. The court affirmed. The court noted that the tax court had analyzed the history and purpose of &sect; 54:4-23.12a, applied the facts to the statutory provisions, and concluded that no disqualifying activity was present in the taxpayer's greenhouse complex. The tax court had special expertise, and the court would not disturb the tax court's findings unless they were clearly arbitrary or not grounded in substantial evidence. The court concluded that tax court's application of the facts to the law was without error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed concurrent sentencing imposed upon his plea of guilty to violations of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:35-7, 2C:35-7.1, entered by the Superior Court, Law Division, Atlantic County (New Jersey), where defendant was convicted of being in possession of cocaine both within 1,000 feet of a school and within 500 feet of a public park, and he argued the offenses should have been merged for sentencing purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was charged with multiple, drug-related criminal offenses. The charges related to his arrest while he possessed eight ziploc bags containing suspected cocaine which he intended to share with or sell to others. Separate counts of the criminal indictment alleged he violated both N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7, which involved being in possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school, and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:35-7.1, which involved possession of a controlled dangerous substance within 500 feet of a public park. The same criminal event gave rise to both violations. Defendant pled guilty to both offenses and the trial court imposed two concurrent five-year custodial terms. Defendant appealed the imposition of concurrent terms on the grounds that the offenses should have merged into one another. The court reversed. The court held that merger principles dictated that concurrent sentences could not have been imposed for offenses that arose out of the same criminal event where the only distinction involved was the distance to particular public properties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sentence reversed and matter remanded for modification of sentence because imposing two concurrent sentences for violating separate statutes that involved both being in possession of a controlled dangerous substance within 1,000 feet of a school and being within 500 feet of a public park, where both offenses were part of the same single criminal offense, required that the offenses be merged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction on three counts of the fourth degree offense of acquiring a handgun without a permit to purchase, contrary to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:58-3a and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-10a from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Monmouth County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty but reserved the right to appeal that a federal firearms license he held for a place of business in North Carolina precluded a New Jersey prosecution, New Jersey statutes were preempted by federal, and New Jersey's enactment unduly burdened interstate commerce. Defendant also had a New Jersey firearms purchaser identification card, but not a New Jersey firearms dealer's license nor a New Jersey permit to purchase handguns. The federal Gun Control Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 921-930, did not occupy the field nor preempted state legislation. No direct and positive conflict existed between the federal and state enactments. They were entirely consistent: each required a license or permit and an individual could comply with both. Defendant's federal license, which expressly referred to his North Carolina business address, had no territorial effect beyond that address. Federal firearms licenses were valid only for the location specified on the license. The purpose and effect of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:58-3a was reasonable and non-discriminatory. Defendant demonstrated no burden of any kind on interstate commerce, let alone a &quot;clearly excessive&quot; burden.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction and sentence affirmed because defendant's federal license was specifically limited to his North Carolina place of business, because the federal legislation made clear that it did not have the preemptive effect urged by defendant, and because the New Jersey statute did not unduly burden interstate commerce. Defendant failed to meet his heavy burden of demonstrating constitutional invalidity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee received a settlement. It obtained a judgment and a writ of execution. Appellant sheriff was enlisted to execute the writ, and pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22A:4-8, sought a commission. Appellee objected, arguing the commission far exceeded the actual costs incurred by appellant in conducting the sale. The court affirmed, finding the commission excessive in comparison to appellant's actual costs. Such a commission would have constituted a tax, rather than a fee, which was not intended by the legislature. The disparity in the commission and actual cost of services rendered was enormous. Appellant logged approximately 10 hours of work; the commission, based solely on the basis of the amount of the successful bid for the property, was $ 275,000. Thus, the fee took on a revenue raising characteristic not intended in the legislation. There was no legislative history indicating otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from the Public Employment Relations Commission, which found a grievance filed by respondent on behalf of a teacher who was told his extracurricular coaching position would not be renewed was arbitrable and that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:27-4.1 did not repeal N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:13A-23, which mandated that disputes involving extracurricular assignments were negotiable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A teacher was told he would be removed from his post as the golf coach for failure to meet certain goals set out in a previous evaluation. Respondent filed a grievance on the teacher's behalf and requested arbitration. Appellant sought to restrain arbitration, arguing that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:27-4.1 (&sect; 18A) had placed the type of dispute at issue outside the scope of negotiations and had repealed N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:13A-23 (&sect; 34), which had classified disputes over extracurricular assignments as subject to negotiation. The court affirmed the commission's decision. The statutes dealt with different subject matter and did not conflict. Section 34 applied only after a school board decided not to renew a contract. Section 18A allowed a school board to renew a contract only if a chief school administrator (CSA) had so recommended. Section 18A clarified the roles of a school board and CSA in making personnel decisions. Section 18A was not preemptive, because it did not expressly preclude negotiations over nonrenewals of contracts. Section 34 was not an unconstitutional delegation of governmental power to a private party because an arbitrator would not be setting educational policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the commission's decision, finding that the statute that mandated that disputes involving extracurricular assignments were negotiable was not repealed by a later statute because the two statutes dealt with entirely different subject matter and did not conflict. The later statute did not preempt the earlier statute because it did not expressly preclude negotiation over nonrenewal of contracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Monmouth County, which dismissed indictments against defendants that included charges for violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:36-5b, 2C:39-7b as those statutes related to traditional BB guns and finding those statutes were preempted by 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5001.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and third degree unlawful possession of a handgun without a permit when they were arrested in possession of BB guns.  N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2C:36-5b, 2C:39-7b. The indictments concerning those charges were dismissed when the lower court found 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 5001, which prohibited the banning of the sale of traditional BB guns, preempted the state statutes. The court reversed and remanded. The state statutes' classification of a BB gun as a handgun did not bar the acquisition of BB guns. The requirement that a person obtain a permit to carry a BB gun was not burdensome. The requirements for obtaining the permit were easily met. Nothing in the legislative history of &sect; 5001 indicated that the statute meant to preempt traditional state police powers of regulating the use and possession of handguns. The federal statute's concern was to make imitation firearms were clearly marked as such, not to preempt regulation of firearms. New Jersey's statutes regulated the use and possession of firearms and were not preempted by &sect; 5001.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five consolidated appeals came before the instant court, involving related issues concerning solid waste disposal. Three appeals arose from decisions of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Mercer County, and two appeals arose from decisions of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Morris County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five appeals were argued together involving related issues concerning solid waste disposal. Defendants contended that plaintiffs should be time-barred from seeking to overturn 1988 and 1993 license and easement agreements. The instant court was faced with the issue of deciding whether the agreements at issue were invalid for failure to comply with the requirements of the Local Public Contracts Law. Defendants maintained that the agreements, by creating an easement, an interest in real property, were exempt from the Local Public Contracts Law. The court concluded that the defendant counties were envisioning contracts for solid waste disposal and that they entered contracts for solid waste disposal, albeit clothed in different raiment. The court stated that the agreements between the counties and Waste Management did not create an easement such as would exempt the transactions from the requirements of the Local Public Contracts Law. In the court's judgment, it would run counter to public policy to permit parties, by the simple expedient of calling a solid waste disposal contract an &quot;easement,&quot; to escape the scrutiny and examination inherent in the public bidding process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed two cases as moot, remanded one case to the trial court, affirmed the order of the trial court permitting amendment of the complaint in the fourth case, and reversed and remanded the order of the trial court in the fifth case. The agreements between the counties and Waste Management were contracts for solid waste disposal, and not easements as would exempt the transactions from the Local Public Contracts Law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the indictments on grounds the statute was unconstitutionally vague, or alternatively, that the prosecutor improperly charged the grand jury concerning the statutory presumption of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:24-4(b)(6). The court reversed. A 1999 amendment to the statute was a clarification of existing law as opposed to a substantive change. The statutory version in 1998 was not vague as a reasonable person would have understood that dissemination of child pornography over the Internet was clearly delivery or transfer under the statute. The possession and distribution of digital images versus film or prints did not make the statute vague and the grand jury was properly instructed concerning the statutory presumption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed judgment of Superior Court, Law Division, Somerset County (New Jersey), upholding the validity of two zoning ordinances adopted by defendant township committee, changing area zoning so that plaintiff's tract could be subdivided only into 10-acre lots, rather than 3-acre lots, as under prior zoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owned a large agricultural tract in a township whose defendant governing board had adopted a plan that would have eventually permitted plaintiff to subdivide his land into three-acre lots. Defendant modified its plan and enacted zoning ordinances that changed minimum lot sizes, except where size averaging applied, to 10 acres. Plaintiff challenged the validity of the ordinances, arguing that they actually had the illegal purpose of fiscal zoning and that they effected an uncompensated taking of his property. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's finding of validity. Plaintiff had the burden to show invalidity of defendant's enactment, which had the expressed purpose of preserving the area's agricultural character, a permitted purpose under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:55D-2. Since this was a real purpose of the ordinances, the court could not be concerned with improper motives allegedly expressed by individual committee members. Plaintiff's loss in value was de minimis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, because plaintiff failed to meet his burden to show that the ordinances had an improper purpose or that they were inconsistent with the applicable land use plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance agency appealed from an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Union County which dismissed its action against defendant insurer for breach of contract for terminating its agency relationship and tortious interference with that contract against other defendants, in an action involving The Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:33B-1 to -64.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance agency originated a high volume of policies for defendant insurer under The Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:33B-1 to -64 (FAIRA). FAIRA required automotive insurers to &quot;take all comers&quot;, that is, to accept applications submitted by all eligible persons, who were those not falling within a statutorily defined poor risk category. Defendant experienced heavy underwriting losses and terminated plaintiff's agency relationship. The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's breach of contract action against defendant insurer and tortious interference action against other defendants. Defendant insurer had not exhausted the statutory remedies to seek rate increases or to suspend its obligation to &quot;take all comers.&quot; FAIRA's &quot;take all comers&quot; requirement was violated when defendant terminated the agency relationship because of the plaintiff's production of a high volume of high loss ratio policies, unrelated to administrative incompetence or poor business practices. Defendant's actions penalized plaintiff because of the expected or actual experience produced by the agent's automobile insurance business, and thus violated FAIRA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed. The statute's &quot;take all comers&quot; requirement was violated where the defendant terminated the agency relationship because of the plaintiff's production of a high volume of high loss ratio policies, unrelated to administrative incompetence or poor business practices, and penalized plaintiff because of the expected or actual experience produced by the plaintiff's automobile insurance business in violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held the action was untimely, as it was filed later that 45 days after the accrual of the right of review, hearing or relief claimed, N.J. Ct. R. 4:69-6. The court held that a party challenging the validity of an added assessment must comply with the statutory appeals provisions. Failure to meet the statutory filing deadlines was a fatal jurisdictional defect.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed an appeal from a decision of the Superior Court, Law Division, Bergen County (New Jersey), which, after a jury trial, found appellant guilty of felony murder and sentenced him to 50 years confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of felony murder and three robberies, appealed, arguing there was insufficient evidence that he committed robberies and insufficient proof that the automobile crash causing the victim's death occurred during the immediate flight from a robbery. The court affirmed the felony murder conviction and sentence; directed the merger of the aggravated manslaughter and all robbery convictions and remanded for a corrected judgment. The court found no basis in the proofs or the jury instructions, taken as a whole, to reverse the felony murder conviction. As the police dispatch related to a report concerning one or more of what the jury found to be robberies, the police chase was sufficiently related to a robbery, and since the victim's death occurred during the immediate flight from a robbery, the court sustained the felony murder conviction. The fact that police officers deviated from safe pursuit guidelines did not excuse appellant's conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Felony murder conviction affirmed. The robbery and appellant's flight causing the victim's death were part of a &quot;continuous transaction.&quot; The resulting fatal accident was not too remote, dependent on police conduct, or otherwise so unexpected or unusual that it was unjust to hold appellant responsible for the victim's death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated proceedings, industrial and commercial utilities customers appealed from two decisions of respondent, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, which ordered payment of stranded cost charges mandated by the Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act of 1999, N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Faced with deregulation of public utilities, respondent New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) held administrative hearings.

The court affirmed, holding that the regulatory proceedings met the essentials of due process and the Adminstrative Procedure Act, N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted aggravated sexual assault, attempted sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, and robbery. The charges were dismissed with prejudice because the trial court concluded that defendant was mentally incompetent to stand trial and that he was not a danger to himself or to society. On appeal, the state argued that unduly high standards were applied in determining whether it had met the burden of establishing defendant's competence by a preponderance of the evidence. The court found that defendant's answers to the trial court's questions reflected a considerable degree of comprehension. The court further found that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's conclusion that defendant posed no danger to society or himself, absent any factual exploration into whether, competent or not, defendant did in fact attempt the sexual assaults and commit a robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff township claimed that the defendant state agency had not been legislatively authorized to construct and own the arts center complex (complex) that the plaintiff sought to tax, that part of the complex constructed after the state legislature limited the defendant's authority was not &quot;grandfathered&quot; under a prior, more expansive grant of authority, and that the defendant's lease with a private company to operate the complex as a profit-making entertainment venture had so changed the use of the complex that it could no longer be accorded public purpose tax immunity. The legislature &quot;grandfathered&quot; the complex, as it then existed, when it limited the defendant's authority.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Middlesex County denying his motion to vacate the restitution order and concluding that the settlement agreement and release given to defendant by the victim were not binding upon the court or the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a crime and subjected to a restitution order. The court held he was not absolved from the terms of restitution by settling with the victim in a civil action arising out of the same facts which formed the basis of the criminal conviction. Defendant sought to extinguish his entire restitution obligation owed to victim because of the much smaller amount he paid in satisfaction of a civil judgment. The court held the release victim signed did not, by its terms, release defendant from his obligations under the restitution order. Requiring a defendant to pay restitution to a victim served to rehabilitate the wrongdoer, as well as to compensate the victim. The settlement agreement ignored this rehabilitative purpose. The court held a sentence that merely required defendant to repay the victim money obtained through fraud was not cruel and unusual, nor violated the prohibition against excessive fines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because defendant was not absolved from terms of restitution by settling with victim in civil action arising out of same facts which formed basis of the criminal conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, municipality and state, sought review of a Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Hudson County decision for appellee, that a statutory amendment removing authority to enact a payroll tax from municipalities that had not already enacted such tax was unconstitutional under N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, municipality and state, challenged whether a statute that empowered cities to enact a payroll tax, which was amended to limit such power to cities that had already enacted the tax, was constitutional. The legislative history of the statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:48C-19, indicated it had been expressly intended to assist appellant municipality while it was undergoing extreme financial hardship. Appellee demonstrated no hardship. Because the state had a strong interest in limiting municipalities' ability to enact payroll taxes, the amendment permissibly restricted that ability. Appellee did not enact the tax when it was eligible to do so, and never relied on that tax. Appellants' ability to collect the tax had no effect upon appellee. Since the court had found a conceivable rational basis for the amendment, appellee had not met its burden of demonstrating clearly the constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant board adopted a conflict of interest policy that prohibited all employees from conducting any political activity on school property, as well as from engaging in any such activity with students during school hours. When plaintiff association's collective bargaining agreement expired, and school employees began displaying buttons relating to collective bargaining, defendant board prohibited employees from wearing the buttons while at school. Plaintiff association sued defendants, the board of education and others. Plaintiff sought declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the defendant board from enforcing its policy. Defendant board's policy restraining school employees from actively campaigning and prohibiting campaign materials was unconstitutional, because those policies barred employees from campaigning outside the presence of the students. The policies were overbroad. However, the policy barring the teachers from collective bargaining in front of students was not unconstitutional. Thus, the policy prohibiting teachers from wearing the buttons was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff counties, political subdivisions of the State of New Jersey, sought judicial review of the validity of a regulation, N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13, &sect; 90-4.2, promulgated by defendant Juvenile Justice Commission (JJC) that provided for a 45-day transfer period for State-sentenced juveniles housed in county correctional facilities and detention centers. In a consolidated appeal, plaintiffs challenged both the regulation's constitutionality and its validity. The appellate court upheld the regulation, holding that within the rule-making authority of the JJC; that it was properly adopted by the JJC; that it was within the scope of the broad enabling legislation of N.J.S.A. 52:17B-170e; that the regulation did not directly conflict with N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:44.1 and 2A:4A-37; and that the record was inadequate to entertain the constitutional issue concerning parole rights to &quot;good-time&quot; credits for juvenile offenders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The regulation was affirmed as a valid exercise of delegated legislative power to the state juvenile agency.

The search yielded cocaine. Defendant appealed his drug conviction, contending evidence seized during the strip search should have been suppressed. The court agreed, holding a strip search of defendant was improper because there were no recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement and the two-hour investigative detention of defendant to permit police to search for other outstanding arrest warrants did not render defendant &quot;lawfully confined in a municipal detention facility.&quot; Body cavity search was also improper because defendant was not &quot;confined in an adult county correctional facility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
