<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee restaurant and appellee beverage association sought a declaratory judgment, challenging the constitutionality of Okla. Stat. art. 37, &sect; 598 (Supp. 1997), which attempted to grant authority to the appellant Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement Commission to regulate 3.2 (low-point) beer. The District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, granted the judgment, and it found the statute was unconstitutional. The commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant held a license to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on its premises. The commission permitted the restaurant to establish a bar area to serve people over the age of 21. An audit of the restaurant showed that the sale of food did not exceed the income derived from the sale of alcoholic beverages and 3.2 beer. As a result, the commission informed the restaurant that a sign would be posted at the door saying &quot;21 only.&quot; The restaurant argued that the commission lacked the power to do what it planned to do, and the restaurant risked losing its family restaurant status. The commission argued that the controlling statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 598 (Supp. 1997), was not unconstitutional, as it simply attempted to regulate who would enter the premises. The appellate court determined that the statute was unconstitutional, as it included low-point beer in the definition of alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sued defendant attorney in the District Court of LeFlore County (Oklahoma) for legal malpractice in his defense against first degree murder charges. The inmate was convicted and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. The trial court granted the attorney's motion to dismiss the negligence suit on the ground that the inmate's petition failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that the injury resulting from the attorney's alleged breach of duty was his wrongful conviction. The inmate's conviction had not been set aside. Thus, his conviction was not a wrongful conviction, but a lawful one. The trial court held the inmate had no cause of action for negligence against the attorney until he could plead, in good faith, that his conviction had been invalidated as a proximate result of a breach of duty which arose out of the attorney-client relationship. The appellate court agreed. The appellate court also found that the inmate's claim was time-barred. The statute of limitations began to run when petitioner was sentenced for his crime on December 5, 1996. The inmate filed his civil suit on October 16, 2000, well after the two year limitation period had expired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant sought workers' compensation benefits from respondents, employer and the principal employer. The employer provided written proof of workers' compensation coverage from its insurance agent to the principal employer, but no policy was ever issued. Respondent Workers' Compensation Court (Oklahoma) exonerated the principal employer from liability and upheld an award of benefits against the employer only. The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant argued that: (1) the principal employer could not escape the secondary liability provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 11(B)(2) by reliance on a certificate of insurance coverage because the statute conferred that ability only on a independent contractor; and (2) Sloan v. Ringwald, which involved a certificate of non-coverage, should be applied to invalidate any statutory exemption from liability which the principal employer might otherwise possess. Both of these arguments presented questions of law to the appellate court. The appellate court rejected the claimant's first argument because Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 11(B)(2) clearly provided for an exemption from secondary liability by a principal employer so long as the principal employer relied in good faith upon proof of a valid workers' compensation insurance policy. The appellate court rejected the claimant's second argument because the Sloan case was distinguishable upon the facts from the claimant's situation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher was recommended to be terminated after her evaluations were poor and she failed to meet any of the objectives of a job targets report.

Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 6-101.24 (2001), because the district gave unspecific written instructions regarding the ways the teacher was to improve. On appeal, the court held that competent evidence supported the trial court's reinstatement decision, given the great deference that the court was required to review the trial court's findings of fact with. The court reversed the award of attorney fees to the teacher. The trial court was without jurisdiction to issue such a judgment without first requiring the teacher to show the district's indebtedness pursuant to Okla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a veterinarian, sued defendants, a television station and a reporter for the station, in the District Court of Creek County, Oklahoma, for defamation and false light invasion of privacy. The district court denied the station's motion for a directed verdict and awarded judgment for compensatory and punitive damages based on the jury's verdict, together with prejudgment interest and costs. The station appealed from the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The station broadcast a series of stories by the reporter concerning the veterinarian's treatment of a halter horse and a quarter horse that died at a racetrack. The halter horse was sold after a show, and the new owner sued in federal court for rescission and damages for breach of warranty and fraud in the inducement of the contract. The federal complaint stated that the veterinarian conducted a prepurchase exam and represented to the buyer that the horse was sound. On appeal the station challenged the sufficiency of the evidence on the issue of liability. The appellate court held that the reporter's statements were not privileged under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1443.1(A) (1991), and that the federal complaint itself, when compared with the reporter's statements, was evidence from which the jury could find the reporter made false and defamatory statements to third parties about the veterinarian and that the statements tended to injure the veterinarian in his profession. Further, the reporter's admission that he was familiar with the federal complaint was clear and convincing evidence from which the jury could find he made the statements with reckless disregard as to their falsity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed as to the finding of liability for slander and false light invasion of privacy and award of punitive damages, reversed as to the award of compensatory damages, and remanded for new trial as to compensatory damages only, with instructions to vacate the punitive damages award in the event there was no award of compensatory damages on remand.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the trial court did not error in vacating the order of revocation, given the agreement's delineation of university jurisdiction was limited to property and public ways adjacent to or surrounded by university property, and the parties' stipulation that neither the offense nor the arrest occurred on the university's campus or on a public way immediately adjacent thereto.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's employment voluntarily ended in November 1992. The employee filed his form 3, employee's first notice of accidental injury and claim for compensation, in October 1996, alleging cumulative trauma injury due to chemical exposure. The employee further alleged the date of last exposure was March 1991. In its answer, the employer, among other things, asserted the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense. The employee argued that the disparate application of Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 43(A) (1991), violated the equal protection clause of the Oklahoma Constitution and the United States Constitution. The employee asserted that although he alternatively pleaded cumulative trauma injury, his expert evidence established he sustained an occupational disease due to chemical exposure and that the limitations period did not bar his claim because the first distinct manifestation of the disease was in approximately May or June 1995. The appellate court ruled that the employee's contention that Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 43(A) (1991), was unconstitutional in that it afforded disparate rules to claimants was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a petition to have the mother's children adjudicated deprived based on the grounds that the mother and her youngest child tested positive for methamphetamine at the time of the child's birth; the home in which the mother and the children had both the water and the electricity disconnected; the mother slept all day, stayed out late at night, and left the children with inadequate supervision; and the mother had refused to get a job and had abandoned her children by voluntarily placing them in foster care. The court adopted a treatment plan that required the mother to get drug abuse counseling, get and keep a job, and other requirements. During that time the children remained in foster care. The appellate court held that termination was improper as the state did not provide evidence that the mother was currently using drugs. The mother made regular visits with her children and had been employed for most of the time since the plan was implemented. As it was a fundamental right for parents to have custody of their children, the court would not terminate the parental rights just because the mother had not followed the exact plan set by the court.</SPAN></P>

The laws regarding CWMP's bore a reasonable relationship to the goal of the Workers' Compensation Act of limiting the cost of medical expenses incurred by employers, who elected to become members of a CWMP.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation's first breach of contract action against the bank was dismissed. The corporation filed a new action, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 100 (1991). At the time it did so, its right to do business in the state was suspended, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1212 (1991), and the statute of limitations on the breach of contract claim expired. The bank moved to dismiss. In response, the corporation submitted a &quot;Certificate of Reinstatement&quot; from the Oklahoma Secretary of State demonstrating that its right to do business was reinstated, pursuant to &sect; 1212(f). The bank contended the corporation's suspension at the time the one-year savings period of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 100 (1991) expired barred the corporation from reviving its claim on which the statute of limitations ran. The trial court agreed and dismissed the corporation's suit. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the corporation's action of paying the taxes and obtaining reinstatement immediately upon the issue being raised in the case cured its later incapacity to sue, even though reinstatement occurred after the commencement of the new action and after the limitations period expired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner claimed that the bank and loan officer encumbered his personal property without his permission, and that he paid a fraudulent loan and was attempting to be repaid that amount plus interest and punitive damages. The bank and loan officer pointed out that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 65 (1991) deprived incarcerated persons of their civil rights, and therefore the prisoner had no right to sue. The appellate court reversed. The court found only one case interpreting the statute, which stated that a court could dismiss a petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted on the basis that a prisoner may only file a civil suit when claiming a violation of constitutional rights. The court found that the prisoner was attempting to enforce claimed property rights in his car through his right of access to the court system. The court held that &sect; 65, if interpreted to disallow the prisoner's action such as this, violated the Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that: (1) the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence that the owner had been convicted in a prior, similar drug distribution effort; (2) placing the burden of proving the innocent ownership defense on the owner was not unconstitutional; and (3) there was sufficient evidence to support the district court's decision that the owner was not an innocent owner of the seized property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers had all retired from the military. They filed an application with the board to receive credit toward their pensions as war veterans.

However, the definition of war veterans in &sect; 67.13a did not only include military retirees whose retirement was based on active service and who had 20 percent or greater service-connected disability. The phrase &quot;honorably discharged&quot; in &sect; 67.13a included persons who were honorably relieved, released, transferred, or retired from active duty status. The officers were war veterans within the meaning of &sect; 67.13a, and were entitled to military service credit. The amount of military service credit attributable to each officer was ascertainable. Pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 23, &sect; 6 (1991), they were entitled to prejudgment interest from the dates of their retirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1984, claimant filed a claim asserting compensable job-related injuries to his neck and back. In 1997, claimant filed a claim asserting subsequent, compensable job-related injuries to his back and legs. Petitioner trust fund sought review of an order of a three-judge panel of the workers' compensation court holding petitioner's obligation to pay claimant permanent total disability (PTD) benefits arose after passage of the number of weeks attributable to the settlement of claimant's subsequent injury claim against his employer until the last date temporary total disability (TTD) was paid. The appellate court affirmed. Under the general rule, where a claimant suffered TTD followed by permanent partial disability (PPD), the right to payment of benefits for PPD arises when the payments for TTD ended. Therefore, the three-judge panel committed no error in directing the fund to pay PTD benefits to claimant upon expiration of the PPD benefits.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1290.8(C) (Supp. 2000) of the Oklahoma Self-Defense Act and assessed a fine for each of two firearms. The Carter County, Oklahoma, District Court affirmed but reduced the fine to a single fine. The permit holder appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sheriff's deputies were called to the permit holder's home to investigate a domestic dispute. The permit holder denied that there were any firearms present in the house, even though he was carrying a concealed semi-automatic pistol and sitting on a couch cushion that concealed a loaded revolver. Administrative charges were filed against the permit holder for failing, as a permit holder, to inform the deputy that he was in possession of concealed firearms. The appellate court found no need to address the permit holder's equal protection argument because it concluded that the OSBI did not meet its burden of proving that the permit holder was carrying the concealed firearms pursuant to the act. It was crucial to the imposition of the administrative fine that the hearing officer have made a factual determination that the permit holder was carrying a concealed firearm in the confines of his own home pursuant to the act, rather than pursuant to existing common law, which permitted him to carry a loaded weapon in his home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the adjudicative order of the OSBI.</SPAN></P>

The district court withdrew the grandparent visitation order and appellant grandmother appealed. The court found that the supreme court had held that Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 5 (1991) was an unconstitutional intrusion upon the fundamental rights of parents as applied to objecting parents of an intact family. It therefore found that although the trial court had used incorrect tests, i.e. substantial change in condition and best interests, the court was nonetheless correct in terminating the prior order of grandparental visitation. Appellee parents showed the court two factors which made the application of &sect; 5 to their situation unconstitutional: they objected to grandparental visitation, and they existed as a nuclear family. Termination of the grandparental visitation orders was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee purported tax resale property purchaser filed an action to quiet title against appellant property owner. The county treasurer listed appellant's property for sale for delinquent ad valorem taxes. The treasurer caused appropriate notices to be published and mailed by certified mail.

Appellee subsequently purchased the property. He applied for a tax deed and served notice on appellant that he would demand a deed unless appellant redeemed. Appellant did not redeem and appellee received a tax deed. Appellee filed his quiet title action and motion for summary judgment. Appellant responded and contended appellant's deed was invalid because she had not received proper notice of the original tax sale. The trial court granted appellee summary judgment. Appellant challenged that holding. The court reversed. Since appellant had not received constitutionally sufficient notice of the original tax sale, the treasurer lacked jurisdiction to sell her property for taxes, and the tax deed based upon that sale was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action for declaratory judgment contesting the findings of an investigatory report prepared by defendant state auditor. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing, inter alia, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court granted the motion without specifying a basis for the dismissal. Plaintiffs filed suit again, seeking a declaratory judgment. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the same grounds as before, as well as on the grounds of res judicata. The trial court denied defendant's motion and granted plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. The court reversed. Because the court did not know the basis for the trial court's dismissal of the first case, the court could not have held that the second lawsuit was barred by res judicata. The court reversed on the grounds that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction, because there was no actual, justiciable controversy. Defendant's legal conclusions did not have the force of law, which placed the plaintiffs directly in legal peril.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees sought to adopt a child without the consent of the biological parents. Subsequent to the granting of appellees' petition, appellant, the child's biological father, argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a jury trial on the matter. Appellant contended that the statute providing for a determination of parental rights without a jury trial was unconstitutional. Reviewing the state's adoption laws, the court held that the statute under which appellees had filed their claim provided for the determination of eligibility for adoption of the child, but did not automatically terminate the parental rights of appellant, as the child's biological father. Relying on prior caselaw, the court noted that appellant's parental rights were not terminated until the actual decree of adoption was entered. Thus, the court upheld the constitutionality of the statute at issue and reversed the portion of the trial court's order terminating appellant's parental rights. However, the court upheld the portion declaring the child eligible for adoption without appellant's consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant's minor children were adjudicated deprived, she agreed to a treatment plan to correct conditions leading to the adjudications. When appellant failed to correct the conditions, the State petitioned to terminate her rights and, after a jury trial, they were terminated.

Stat. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 7003-4.7(B), 7006-1.6(B) together provided safeguards for appellant prior to initiation of termination proceedings, and, because there was nothing in either section depriving appellant of any defense, the court found no constitutional right violations. Because the challenged jury instructions sufficiently set forth the statutory elements for terminating parental rights with adequate clarity as to provide the jury with guidance for proper evaluation of evidence offered supporting the State's claims and appellant's defenses, appellant's parental rights were properly terminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The trial court ruled the cash was forfeitable because it was in close proximity to a controlled dangerous substance and because it was a thing of value acquired from a violation of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act (Act). The State did not prove any violation of the Act to be the source of the money. Without such proof, forfeiture could not lie under Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-503(B). The other ground for forfeiture was close proximity under Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-503(A)(7).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother appealed from judgment entered by the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma), after a jury verdict terminating her parental rights in her children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother stipulated to the State's petition seeking to have appellant's children adjudicated deprived, based on allegations that the father sexually abused the oldest child. The State moved to terminate appellant's parental rights, alleging she failed to correct conditions leading to the deprived adjudication. Appellant's parental rights were terminated and she appealed. The court affirmed, holding that Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 7006(A)(10) provided for immediate termination of parental rights upon a finding of sexual or physical abuse which was heinous or shocking, without a prior adjudication of deprived status or an opportunity to correct conditions. Because the heinous and shocking ground was included in the State's motion to terminate parental rights filed three months before trial, appellant was on notice at that time and not prejudiced. The court found that under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 7006-1.1(A)(15), termination of parental rights was permissive, not mandatory, and because it included that the best interests of the child was the paramount consideration in any termination case, the statute was not a strict liability statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. The summary of the evidence indicated that the State proved by clear and convincing evidence that terminating appellant's parental rights was in her children's best interests when she failed to prove that she had corrected conditions leading to the deprived adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner judge filed an application for writ of prohibition, and for an order staying proceedings in the Court on the Judiciary, Trial Division which alleged misconduct that was not serious enough to require removal or compulsory retirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court on the Judiciary, Trial Division erred when it denied petitioner judge's motions challenging its jurisdiction. Okla. Const. art. 7-A &sect;&sect; 1, 4 required judicial complaints to be brought for no other purpose than that of removing or retiring the judge who was the subject of the proceeding. The Council on Judicial Complaints and the Court on the Judiciary lacked jurisdiction to discipline judges whose claimed misconduct would not lead to removal from office. The complaint lodged against petitioner by an unsuccessful litigant in a divorce case was likely based, not on dissatisfaction with the alleged rule violation, but on the results of the decision. In the petitioner's 11 year career as an associate district judge he was seldom reversed on appeal. Petitioner's violations were not continued willful failure to comply with rules and directives. The court held the proceeding against petitioner did not rise to the level of misconduct envisioned by the framers of Okla. Const. art. 7-A &sect; 1 et seq. to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court on the Judiciary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Writ of prohibition granted. The Council on Judicial Complaints and the Court on the Judiciary lacked jurisdiction to consider allegations of misconduct by petitioner judge that, even if true, would not call for the judge's removal from office or compulsory retirement. Discipline for minor judicial misconduct was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
