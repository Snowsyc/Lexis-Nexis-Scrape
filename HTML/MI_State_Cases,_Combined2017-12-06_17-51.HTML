<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rahim Omarkhan Lockridge was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for the death of his wife, MCL 750.321, following a jury trial in the Oakland Circuit Court. His minimum sentence range calculated under the sentencing guidelines, MCL 777.1 et seq., was 43 to 86 months. The court, Nanci J. Grant, J., concluded that there were factors not accounted for in scoring the guidelines, including a probation violation, killing his wife in front of their three children, leaving the children at home with their mother dead on the floor, and prior domestic violence. Citing these as substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the minimum sentence range, MCL 769.34(3), the court sentenced defendant to a term of 8 years (96 months) to 15 years (the statutory maximum sentence). Defendant appealed, challenging both the scoring of the guidelines and the trial court's decision to exceed the guidelines minimum sentence range. While his case was pending in the Court of Appeals, the United States Supreme Court decided </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Alleyne v United States</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 570 U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; 133 S Ct 2151; 186 L.

After allowing defendant&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to file a supplemental brief challenging the guidelines scoring on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Alleyne</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grounds, the Court of Appeals, BECKERING, P.J., and O'CONNELL and SHAPIRO, JJ., affirmed defendant's sentence in three separate opinions and rejected the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Alleyne</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> challenge. Judge O'CONNELL stated in the lead opinion that the panel was bound by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Herron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 303 Mich App 392; 845 N.W.2d 533 (2013), which had rejected the same argument based on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Alleyne</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Judge BECKERING stated in her concurring opinion that had she not been bound by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Herron</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, she would have held that requiring judicial fact-finding to set the guidelines mandatory minimum sentence range violated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Alleyne</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and that the guidelines should be made advisory to cure the constitutional problem.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFT Michigan and numerous other labor organizations representing public school employees brought an action in the Court of Claims against the state of Michigan, the State Treasurer, the Public School Employees' Retirement System, and others, asserting various constitutional challenges to 2012 PA 300, which had amended the Public School Employees Retirement Act, MCL 38.1301 et seq. In particular, the act added MCL 38.1391a(5), which enables current public school employees to opt out of retiree healthcare and thereby avoid paying the 3% retiree healthcare contributions required by MCL 38.1343e, a statute enacted in 2010 and subsequently struck down by the Court of Appeals as violating the Takings Clauses, Contracts Clauses, and Due Process Clauses of the Michigan and United&nbsp;States&nbsp;Constitutions in AFT Mich v Michigan, 297 Mich App 597; 825 N.W.2d 595 (2012). It also added MCL 38.1391a(8), which provides a separate retirement allowance for public school employees who elect to pay the 3% contributions but subsequently fail to qualify for retiree healthcare benefits. Furthermore, the act altered the manner in which public school employees accrue pension benefits. It increased the amount that all current public school employees must contribute in order to continue accruing pension benefits at the existing rate. MCL 38.1343g(1)(a) requires members of the retirement system's Basic Plan (who had not previously contributed to their pensions)&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to contribute 4% of their salaries to the retirement system for that purpose. MCL 38.1343g(1)(b) requires members of the retirement system's Member Investment Plan to contribute 7% of their salaries to the system. Employees who decline to make the additional contributions will accrue future pension benefits at a lower amount. Finally, MCL 38.1384b(3) and (4) allow employees to discontinue accruing future pension benefits altogether and participate in a 401(k)-style Tier 2 retirement account. The act, however, altered only the manner in which employees accrue pension benefits arising after the act's effective date. It had no effect on pension benefits previously accrued. Plaintiffs argued that the act violated the Takings&nbsp;Clauses, Const 1963, art 10, &sect; 2 and US Const, Ams V and XIV; that the act impaired the obligation of contracts in violation of the Contracts&nbsp;Clauses, Const 1963, art 1, &sect; 10 and US Const, art I, &sect; 10, cl 1; and that the act violated the Due Process&nbsp;Clauses, Const 1963, art 1, &sect; 17 and US Const, Am XIV, &sect; 1. The Court of Claims, Rosemarie E. Aquilina, J., ruled in favor of defendants on all claims, and plaintiffs appealed. The Court of Appeals, SAAD, P.J., and K. F. KELLY, J. (GLEICHER, J., concurring), affirmed, concluding that contributions to the retiree healthcare program would be made voluntarily and were therefore free of constitutional infirmity and that the act did not affect&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any obligation of contracts between the state and public school employees with regard to the pension modification because the state is not obligated to provide future pension benefits to public school employees. 303 Mich App 651; 846 N.W.2d 583 (2014).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) brought an action in the Court of Claims against the Department of Treasury, challenging the department's ruling that IBM was not entitled to apportion its business income tax base and modified gross receipts tax base using the three-factor apportionment formula provided in the Multistate Tax Compact, MCL 205.581 et seq., and was instead required to apportion its income using the sales-factor formula in the Business Tax Act, MCL 208.1101 et seq., when calculating its state taxes for 2008. Under this ruling, IBM was entitled to a refund of only $1,253,609 for the 2008 tax year rather than the $5,955,218 it had sought. IBM moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), and the department moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(I)(2). After a hearing, the Court of Claims, Joyce A. Draganchuk, J., denied IBM's motion and granted summary disposition in favor of the department, ruling that the BTA mandated the use of the sales-factor apportionment formula. The Court of Appeals, Ronayne Krause, P.J., and Borrello, J. (Riordan, J., concurring), affirmed the Court of Claims order in an unpublished opinion per curiam issued November &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 20, 2012 (Docket No. 306618). It held that because there was a facial conflict between the BTA's mandatory sales-factor apportionment formula and the Compact's elective three- factor apportionment formula, the Legislature had repealed the Compact's election provision by implication when it enacted the BTA. The Supreme Court granted IBM's application for leave to appeal. 494 Mich. 874, 832 N.W.2d 388 (2013). In a lead opinion by Justice Viviano, joined by Justices Cavanagh and Markman, and a concurring opinion by Justice Zahra, the Supreme Court held: The modified gross receipts tax is an income tax for purposes of the Multistate Tax Compact. IBM was entitled to use the Compact's elective three-factor apportionment formula to calculate its 2008 Michigan taxes. Court of Appeals judgment reversed; Court of Claims order granting summary disposition in favor of the Department reversed; case remanded to the Court of Claims for entry of an order granting summary disposition in favor of IBM. Justice Viviano, joined by Justices Cavanagh and Markman, held that the modified gross receipts tax fit within the Compact's broad definition of &quot;income tax&quot; by taxing a variation of net income, specifically, the entire &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> amount received by the taxpayer as determined from any gainful activity minus inventory and certain other deductions that are expenses not specifically and directly related to a particular transaction. He further concluded that the Court of Appeals erred by holding that the BTA had repealed the Compact's election provision by implication because the statutes could be reconciled when read in pari materia. Justice Zahra, concurring, agreed that IBM was entitled to use the Compact's elective apportionment formula for its 2008 Michigan taxes, and also that the tax bases at issue were &quot;income taxes&quot; within the meaning of the Compact. He would not have reached the question whether the Legislature repealed the Compact's election provision by implication when it enacted the BTA because the Legislature made clear that taxpayers were entitled to use the Compact's election provision for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years. Justice McCormack, joined by Chief Justice Young and Justice Kelly, dissenting, would have affirmed the Court of Appeals judgment, concluding that allowing taxpayers to apportion their multistate income in accordance with the Compact's formula violated the Legislature's unambiguous &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> directive that taxes established under the BTA must be in accordance with the BTA's sales-only apportionment formula. She further concluded that there was no constitutional barrier that prevented the Legislature from making the Compact's alternative election provision unavailable to taxpayers.<BR>IBM v.

Fobb, 145 Mich. App. 786 (1985), and People v. Hubbard, 217 Mich. App. 459 (1996), to the extent that they required that the act be of serious consequence to the victim.; [2]-Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of extortion because it showed that he was upset and used vulgar language when, while armed with a handgun, he threatened to silence the victim, and defendant made the threat with the intent to compel the victim to complete work on defendant's truck in the rain, which the victim did not want to do.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff senior service provider and others sought an order requiring defendant county to instruct all pertinent tax billing authorities or agencies to levy the full 0.5 mill required by an approved property-tax ballot proposition to fund services for older persons. The Court of Appeals of Michigan reversed the circuit court's judgment for mandamus for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The provider and others appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue was whether the Michigan Tax Tribunal or the circuit court possessed jurisdiction over the mandamus claim. The instant appeal was a proceeding for direct review of the county board's final decision not to levy and spend the full 0.5 mill. The board was an agency under MCL 205.703(a), and the issue was one arising under the property tax laws pursuant to MCL 400.576 and Const. 1963, art 9, &sect; 6. Thus, the central issue was whether the board's decision related to the issues set forth in MCL 205.731(a). The dispute did involve rates for the simple fact that both all or nothing, as argued by the provider, constituted a rate of taxation. The provider simply argued that the county was required to levy and spend more. Since all four elements of MCL 205.731(a) were satisfied, the tax tribunal possessed exclusive and original jurisdiction over the case.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion. A jury returned a verdict in her favor. On appeal, the appellate court held she was not engaged in protected activity under the WPA, reversed the trial court's denial of the summary disposition motion, and remanded the case to it for it to enter an order granting summary disposition to the employer. The state supreme court found that; (1) she showed a temporal relationship between the protected activity and the employer's adverse employment action and, thus, the trial court's denial of the employer's summary disposition motion had to be reinstated; and (2) the legality of the employer's action, rather than the alleged budgetary wisdom of it, was at issue and meant that the doctrine of separation of powers was not violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mother gave birth to twins who were conceived by artificial insemination after their father had died. The mother sought social security survivors' benefits for the children based on the father's earnings. The commissioner denied her application, and an administrative law judge affirmed that decision. The mother then filed an action in federal trial court challenging the decision. That court asked the state supreme court to rule on the determinative issue, which was whether the children could inherit from the father under Michigan intestacy law. Only if they could inherit would they be entitled to social security survivors' benefits. The state supreme court then found that under Michigan intestacy law, the mother's children could not inherit from the father. It determined that because the mother's twins were not in gestation at the time of the father's death, given that the mother's eggs were not inseminated with his sperm until 12 days after he died, no inheritance rights vested in them at that time pursuant to MCL 700.2108 and because the twins were not living at the time of his death, they had no inheritance rights as heirs pursuant to MCL 700.2104.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The passenger was injured in a bus accident. She filed an application for no-fault benefits with the transportation authority's insurer soon after, but she waited more than 7 months to notify the transportation authority that she might pursue liability in tort. Partial summary disposition was entered for the transportation service, but the court of appeals reversed. This appeal followed. In reversing the court of appeals, the supreme court determined that MCL 124.419 required that notice be given to the transportation authority within 60 days. The application for no-fault insurance benefits, even when supplemented with presumed &quot;institutional knowledge&quot; of the underlying facts of the injury, did not constitute written notice of a third-party tort claim against the transportation authority sufficient to comply with MCL 124.419. The provisions of MCL 124.419 applied to &quot;ordinary claims&quot; that arose in connection with a common carrier, and the 60-day notice requirement pertained to such claims for personal injury or property damage. An ordinary claim against a common carrier did not include claims made for first-party no-fault benefits.</SPAN></P>

The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed. The driver petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The driver argued that her claim, being a claim for personal injury, was not subject to the dictates or bar-to-claims language of MCL 600.6431(1). She argued that only subsection (3) governed her claim and acted as an independent provision that excluded application of subsection (1). The supreme court found that a reasonable person reading the statute would understand that subsections (1) and (3) were related and interdependent. The context of the entire statutory provision indicated that the six-month filing requirement for personal injury or property damage cases was a modification of the generally applicable one-year filing requirement. The failure to file a compliant claim or notice of intent to file a claim against the state within the relevant time periods designated in either subsection (1) or (3) would trigger the statute's prohibition. Because the driver failed to file any notice of an intent to pursue a claim against the university with the Court of Claims within six months, the driver's claim was barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In prosecutions under MCL 750.165 for failure to pay court-ordered child support, one defendant was convicted by a jury, a second by the court, a third pled guilty. The Court of Appeals, Michigan, affirmed the convictions in the first two cases and in the third denied a delayed application for leave to appeal. The court granted further review to consider the constitutionality of the rule that inability to pay was not a defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Michigan Supreme Court agreed with the holding that MCL 750.165 imposes strict liability because it does not require a mens rea, and that evidence of a defendant's inability to pay, without more, is not a valid defense to a charge of felony nonsupport. The court also held, however, that a defendant charged with felony nonsupport may, in exceptional circumstances, on making the requisite evidentiary showing, establish impossibility as a defense. To establish that defense, a defendant must show that he or she acted in good faith and made all reasonable efforts to comply with the family court order, but could not do so through no fault of his or her own. Sufficient bona fide efforts to seek employment or borrow money in order to pay certainly are expected, but standing alone will not necessarily establish an impossibility defense. Instead, defendants must make all reasonable efforts, use all resources at their disposal to comply with support obligations, and establish that it is not reasonably possible to obtain the resources to pay. One of the defendant's in the current appeal should have been permitted to submit evidence of her mental illness, incapacitation, and disability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the conviction of the first defendant and remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. The court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals in the second case. The third defendant, who entered an unconditional guilty plea, affirmatively waived the impossibility defense and was therefore not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with the misdemeanor offense of violating Michigan State University Ordinance &sect; 15.05. A district court jury convicted defendant of violating the ordinance. On appeal, the circuit court reversed the conviction on the basis that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court's conclusion that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The ordinance made it a crime to disrupt the normal activity of any person, firm, or agency carrying out service, activity or agreement for or with the university. The ordinance prohibited disruptions but did not specify the types of disruptions that were prohibited. Thus, the plain language of the ordinance allowed its enforcement for even verbal disruptions. The verbal disruptions that the ordinance criminalized were not limited to those containing fighting words or obscene language. Also, the ordinance protected a broad class of individuals. Thus, the ordinance criminalized a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment. Therefore, the language in the ordinance making it an offense to disrupt the normal activity of a protected person was facially unconstitutional. Because the case was a criminal matter, MCR 7.101(O) did not provide grounds for awarding costs. Thus, there was no basis to undermine the broad statutory discretion granted the prosecution in its charging decisions, and the assessment of costs against the prosecution was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court reversed the portion of the court of appeals' judgment pertaining to the constitutionality of the ordinance and reinstated the circuit court's decision that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional. The supreme court affirmed the portion of the court of appeals' judgment that costs could not be assessed against the prosecution under MCR 7.101(O) in criminal matters.</SPAN></P>

Respondent city petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court noted that the issue before it was whether the failure of a taxing authority's assessor to adjust the taxable value of real property in the year immediately following a transfer of the property, in accordance with MCL 211.27a(3), precluded a March board of review from adjusting the taxable value in a subsequent year. The city's assessor failed to update the tax rolls to reflect the uncapped taxable values of the taxpayer's recently purchased properties for tax year 2005. The taxable value as entered on the tax rolls for 2005 violated the automatic requirement in MCL 211.27a(3) that the taxable value for the year following the transfer was the uncapped value. The supreme court reinstated the Tax Tribunal's decision affirming the March board of review's correction of the tax rolls to reflect the properly adjusted taxable values. In the second case, the Tax Tribunal had the ability to prospectively adjust the timely challenged taxable values of the taxpayer's parcels for tax year 2001 and subsequent years because the tax year 200 taxable value of the parent parcel was erroneous as a result of the inclusion of unconstitutional additions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In one case, the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to determine which aspects of the victim's testimony met the requirements of MCL 768.27a and, in another, found that MRE 403 applied to evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the evidence. Defendant and the State petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court noted that because a defendant's propensity to commit a crime made it more probable that he committed the charged offense, MCL 768.27a permitted the admission of evidence that MRE 404(b) precluded. The statute established an exception to MRE 404(b) in cases involving a charge of sexual misconduct against a minor. The reasons for enacting the statute were to address a substantive concern about the protection of children and the prosecution of persons who perpetuated certain enumerated crimes against children and were more likely than others to reoffend. MCL 768.27a superseded MRE 404(b). The statute could be read in harmony with MRE 403, and the supreme court had to give effect to the permissive term &quot;may&quot; and the phrase &quot;notwithstanding MCL 768.27&quot; that were present in MCL 768.27a but absent from MCL 768.27b. MRE 403 applied to evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a. Courts had to weigh the propensity evidence in favor of the evidence's probative value. In the first case, any error in admitting all of the victim's testimony was harmless. The trial court erred by misapplying MRE 403 in the second case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was affirmed in the first case; the judgments of the lower courts were vacated in the other case and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A struggle ensued after officers entered a home unlawfully, and defendant was charged with resisting and obstructing a police officer under MCL 750.81d. The trial court denied a request to quash, and the court of appeals affirmed. This appeal followed. In reversing the court of appeals, the supreme court determined that MCL 750.81d did not abrogate the common-law right to resist illegal police conduct, including unlawful arrests and unlawful entries into constitutionally protected areas. While the Michigan Legislature had the authority to modify the common law, it had to do so by speaking in no uncertain terms. Neither the language of MCL 750.81d nor the legislative history of this statute indicated with certainty that the Legislature intended to abrogate the common-law right to resist unlawful arrests or other unlawful invasions of private rights. The supreme court was unable to presume that the Legislature intended to abrogate this right. Therefore, it overruled People v Ventura, 262 Mich. App. 370; 686 N.W.2d 748 (2004) to the extent that it held that the Legislature affirmatively chose to modify the traditional common-law rule that a person may resist an unlawful arrest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court concluded that 2011 PA 280, which amended the County Apportionment Act, was not a &quot;local&quot; act in violation of Const. 1963, art 4, &sect; 29. 2011 PA 280 nullified Oakland County's 25-commissioner district plan and established in its place a 21-commissioner district plan. 2011 PA 280 included a transitional provision requiring any county not in compliance with the Act to reapportion within 30 days of the law's effective date. As a practical matter, because Oakland County was the only county that would not be in compliance with the law on its effective date, only Oakland County would have to reapportion during the transitional period. That Oakland County may have been the only county immediately out of compliance with the Act, and therefore immediately affected by the transitional provision, did not frustrate the Act's general applicability. The appellate court erred by finding that the transitional provision in 2011 PA 280 constituted a &quot;local act.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judge was charged with misconduct for acts such as &quot;fixing&quot; traffic citations issued to himself, his spouse, and his staff; dismissing cases without conducting hearings or involving the prosecutor; failing to follow plea agreements; and making false statements under oath during the JTC hearing. On review, the court held that the duration, scope, and sheer number of respondent judge's substantiated acts of misconduct were without precedent in Michigan judicial disciplinary cases. The judge's long-term pattern of judicial misconduct constituted a negation of the proper exercise of judicial authority that more than justified his removal from office. His misconduct evinced an unacceptable disregard for the role of judge as well as disdain for due process and the right of parties to a fair hearing. His intentional abuses of judicial power to benefit himself, his spouse, and his staff were inconsistent with his oath of office and deleterious to the integrity and honor of the judiciary. His belief that he was above the law and not as subject to the law as those that appeared before him rendered him unworthy of holding judicial office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1984, defendant was convicted of kidnapping and five counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. When he was released from prison in 2002, he was required to comply with the Sex Offenders Registration Act (SORA), MCL 28.721 et seq., which required him to register as a sex offender. In 2006, defendant was charged with violating the registration requirement. He moved to dismiss, arguing that SORA required him to register an address in order to comply with his statutory obligations but that, because he was homeless and did not have an address, he was unable to comply with the obligation to report a &quot;residence&quot; to police under SORA. The circuit court found his argument persuasive and dismissed. On review, the court held that homelessness was not a bar to compliance with SORA because homelessness did not preclude an offender from entering a police station and reporting to a law enforcement agency regarding the offender's residence or domicile. The legislature intended SORA to be a comprehensive system that required all sex offenders to register, whether homeless or otherwise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant's neighbor saw water running down her basement wall and over her electrical box; she heard water flowing behind that wall, which adjoined defendant's townhouse. Unable to locate defendant, the neighbor called 911. The city dispatched several firefighters, who entered defendant's residence. They went into the basement to turn off the water and assess whether additional measures had to be taken to prevent a fire; in plain view in the basement were grow lights and several dozen marijuana plants. The firefighters reported their findings to the police, who obtained a search warrant. Defendant moved to suppress, and the trial court granted the motion, finding that the firefighters violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. On review of the appellate court judgment affirming the trial court's suppression order, the court held that the community caretaking exception applied to firefighters no less than to police officers when they were responding to emergency situations that threatened life or property. Further, the firefighters' actions were reasonable under the circumstances, thus satisfying the community caretaking exception to the warrant requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs owned property that was subject to property taxes. The Michigan State Tax Commission denied the request to reclassify the property. Plaintiffs individually sought and obtained relief in various circuit courts. Defendants appealed the judgments in the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which reversed each of the circuit court judgments and remanded for the entry of orders granting summary disposition in defendants' favor. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Michigan State Tax Commission (STC) property-classification decisions were final decisions of an administrative agency that were quasi-judicial in nature and affected private rights. Consequently, Const. 1963, art 6, &sect; 28 guaranteed judicial review of them, and that guarantee could not be jettisoned by statute. Because MCL 211.34c(6) eliminated any appeal of a final administrative decision that was quasi-judicial in nature and affected private rights, it ran afoul of the guarantee of judicial review in Const. 1963, art 6, &sect; 28. Because the final sentence of MCL 211.34c(6) precluded judicial review of STC classification decisions, the supreme court declared that sentence unconstitutional and severed it, leaving the remainder of MCL 211.34c(6) in full force and effect. Because judicial review had not otherwise been provided by law, MCL 600.631 applied and the circuit courts had subject matter jurisdiction over appeals of a decision of the STC regarding property classifications. Thus, plaintiffs could appeal the decisions in the cases before the supreme court in the circuit court for the county of which plaintiffs were residents or the circuit court for Ingham County, Michigan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court addressed the correct interpretation of the statutory &quot;180-day rule&quot; established by MCL 780.131 and MCL 780.133. The rule did not require that a trial be commenced or completed within 180 days of the date notice was delivered. Rather, it was sufficient that the prosecutor proceed promptly and moved the case to the point of readiness for trial within the 180-day period. The supreme court held that good faith was an implicit component of proper action by the prosecutor, who could not satisfy the rule simply by taking preliminary steps toward trial but then delaying inexcusably. The statutory 180-day period was a fixed period of consecutive days beginning on the date when the prosecutor received the required notice from the Michigan Department of Corrections (DOC). The 180-day rule was satisfied as to defendant because the prosecutor commenced action well within 180 days after receiving notice from DOC, and the record contained no evidence that ensuing delays caused in part by docket congestion were without reason or otherwise inexcusable under the facts of the case; indeed, defendant either requested or explicitly consented to each adjournment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted leave to appeal to consider whether evidence that a child was present in a home in which defendant was in possession of drugs and firearms was, by itself, legally sufficient to support defendant's conviction under MCL 750.145 for doing an act that tended to cause a minor child to become neglected or delinquent so as to tend to come under the jurisdiction of the family division of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The essential elements derived from construing MCL 750.145 in pari materia with MCL 712A.2 required the court to find whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecutor, a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant's actions tended to cause the child to become delinquent or neglected, such that the child tended to come under family court jurisdiction. The court found that the prosecutor presented no evidence regarding the child's education, behavioral history, relationships with his peers, or any other relevant fact that could support the conclusion that defendant's actions tended to cause the child, to become delinquent. Moreover, the record did not establish that the criminality had any impact on the child's home. Therefore, in the instant case, where the jury was presented with no evidence other than that a child was present in a home where criminal activity occurred, the court held that a rational fact-finder could not have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant tended to cause the child to become delinquent or neglected so as to tend to come under family court jurisdiction, as those terms were defined by MCL 712A.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed in part, and defendant's conviction for doing an act that tended to cause a minor child to become neglected or delinquent so as to tend to come under the jurisdiction of the family division of the circuit court was vacated and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. Defendant's convictions for drug and firearm possession remained intact.</SPAN></P>

The Court held that defendant was entitled to resentencing because his sentence was based on inaccurate information due to the Court of Appeals vacating his felonious assault convictions. The Court further concluded that because defendant requested a remand for resentencing as part of his appeal to vacate the felonious-assault convictions, he complied with the requirement of MCL 769.34(10), which mandated that a request for remand be made in a proper motion filed in the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court granted leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An uninsured man was severely injured in an auto accident. The state university's health system provided him with medical treatment. Less than one year after the accident, he sought personal protection insurance benefits. Because he was not covered under a no-fault insurance policy, the state's assigned claims facility designated the insurance company as the servicing insurer for his claims. Nearly five years after the accident, the state university's health system and regents sued the insurance company, and sought  payment from it for his medical treatment. The trial court dismissed the lawsuit upon finding that the one-year back rule of MCL 500.3145(1) barred them recovering the claimed damages. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that even though the one-year-back rule in MCL 500.3145(1) would otherwise bar the recovery of damages, it had to be considered alongside MCL 600.5821(4) allowing claims by the entities listed therein, the State and its subdivisions without regard to limitations period. It then determined that its Cameron decision and the Liptow appellate ruling dictating a contrary result had to be overruled, as they had proved to be unworkable.</SPAN></P>

After the appellate court denied leave to appeal, the state supreme court ordered oral argument on his application for leave to appeal he filed with it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employee, a professional hockey player residing in Michigan, signed a contract in Michigan with defendant employer's professional hockey team. Two years later, he injured himself in a fall in New Brunswick, Canada. He stayed for treatment and became a New Brunswick resident. He later aggravated his injury when he was struck in a game. He filed for Michigan's workers' compensation benefits. Even though an existing statute,&nbsp;MCL 418.845, required that a claimant be a Michigan resident and the relevant contract for hire to be made in Michigan, courts had interpreted it as allowing for claims to be brought solely if there was a contract executed in Michigan. The Workers' Compensation Appellate Court affirmed a dismissal of his claim for benefits. While his case was proceeding, the state supreme court in Karaczewski interpreted MCL 418.845 to require both Michigan residency and Michigan contract execution, and gave that decision retroactive effect. The state supreme court, confronted with the employee's case, overruled the retroactive effect of Karaczewski. It found that the parties' reliance interests would not be affected and no undue hardship would result from such a ruling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient argued that the court of appeals erred in treating the patient's claim as a loss-of-opportunity claim instead of a traditional medical malpractice claim and holding that the patient did not raise a genuine issue of fact because the patient could not prove that receiving the alleged appropriate treatment would have decreased his risk of stroke by greater than 50 percentage points. The supreme court agreed. The court of appeals erred by reversing the trial court's denial of summary disposition. The case presented a traditional malpractice claim. It did not present a claim for loss of opportunity. In traditional malpractice cases, the patient was required to prove that the healthcare provider's negligence more probably than not caused the plaintiff's injury. In the instant case, the testimony of the patient's expert witnesses supported the patient's position on proximate causation under MCL 600.2912a. While that testimony was not dispositive, it was sufficient to raise a question of fact to defeat a motion for summary disposition, allowing the issue to be adjudicated on the merits by the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The teachers, four in all, allegedly were physically assaulted by students.

The trial court granted the school board and school district's summary disposition motion. The appellate court affirmed on the basis that the teachers and union lacked standing to sue under Lee. The state supreme court overruled Lee and its progency on the ground that it did not represent proper standing doctrine because it departed too dramatically from Michigan's historical standing approach in order to adopt a federal constitutional standing test despite significant differences between the Federal and Michigan Constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The injured party broke his ankle when he was run over by a truck and underwent two surgeries. He was unable to return to the job he held prior to the accident. An attempt to recover under MCL 500.3135 was unsuccessful, and this appeal followed. In reversing, the supreme court overruled the decision in Kreiner v Fischer, 471 Mich. 109, 683 N.W.2d 611 (2004). The supreme court then set forth the proper test for determining if there had been a serious impairment of a bodily function. Under MCL 500.3135(7), there were three prongs necessary to establish such. This analysis had to be conducted on a case-by-case basis. In this case, the supreme court was able to decide whether the threshold was met as a matter of law under MCL 500.3135(2)(a). The injured party showed an objectively manifested impairment of bodily function since he continued to suffer pain and a reduced range of motion that inhibited certain bodily functions. Further, the impaired body functions were important. Finally, the injured party showed that the impairment affected his general ability to lead his normal life because it influenced some of his capacity to live in his normal, pre-incident manner of living.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a zoning case, defendant township sought review of a decision by the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which granted injunctive relief to plaintiffs, property owners and a potential developer, on their claims that, inter alia, the township's zoning ordinance was exclusionary in violation of former MCL 125.297a. Plaintiffs sought to have their property rezoned from agricultural to residential use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs had applied to have a 144-acre farm rezoned from agricultural to residential for a 95-unit planned unit development (PUD). While that rezoning request, and a subsequent variance request, were pending, plaintiffs submitted an application to rezone to permit a 498-unit manufactured housing community (MHC). The township would not consider that application because the PUD application was still pending, and plaintiffs withdrew same. However, plaintiffs filed their constitutional claims on the basis of the MHC application. On appeal, the court reversed, finding plaintiffs' claims were not ripe for judicial review as they had not presented the MHC application for consideration to the township. Federal case law indicated that the futility exception in zoning cases did not apply until property owners had submitted at least one meaningful application for a variance from the challenged zoning regulations. Because the ordinance did not expressly prohibit the MHC use, the township had to be afforded the opportunity to determine whether the ordinance was exclusionary in violation of former MCL 125.297a.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the court of appeals' judgment and remanded for entry of a dismissal order consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs, public school districts and taxpayers, and defendants, state department of education and state treasurer (state), were granted leave to appeal from a Court of Appeals' (Michigan) decision, which granted a declaratory judgment that the Headlee Amendment to Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 29 had been violated but declined to award plaintiffs' attorney's fees under Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A portion of the Headlee Amendment to art. 9, &sect; 29 was a prohibition on unfunded mandates (POUM). Plaintiffs claimed that recordkeeping and reporting requirements in Mich. Exec. Order 2000-9 and MCL 388.1752, made necessary to obtain federal funding, violated the POUM provision because no state appropriations had been made to cover the increased costs to the school districts to meet those requirements. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded. While the state claimed that plaintiffs had the burden of proving the specific increase in costs to be entitled to a declaratory judgment, &quot;net cost&quot; as defined under MCL 21.233 constituted the actual cost to the state if the state were to provide the activity or service mandated as a state requirement; thus, such information would be in the state's possession. While plaintiffs only received declaratory judgment on one of 21 claims, that claim had been litigated for six years and had clearly been sustained. Therefore, plaintiffs were entitled to recover the attorney's fees and costs incurred with respect to that claim pursuant to art. 9, &sect; 32.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the declaratory judgment but reversed the decision regarding attorney's fees and remanded to the court of appeals for a determination of costs and attorney's fees to be awarded to plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff variance applicant challenged a decision from the Michigan Court of Appeals, which, on remand, affirmed its prior decision that a denial of a zoning variance request by defendant township entities violated the applicant's equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The applicant contended that, in applying a zoning ordinance relating to the operation of a school in an office park district, the township treated it differently from another entity and violated equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Const. 1963, art 1, &sect; 2. The trial court granted summary disposition to the township, and, after several appeals, the court of appeals determined that the township had violated the applicant's equal protection rights. This appeal followed. In reversing the court of appeals, the supreme court held that the township's consideration of different requests did not constitute different treatment of similarly situated entities. The applicant was not seeking similar treatment; rather, it was asserting religion in an effort to obtain preferential treatment. Because the applicant failed to demonstrate that it was treated differently from other similarly situated entities, the supreme court did not need to apply the rational basis test. Finally, the township did not discriminatorily apply the facially neutral zoning ordinance against the applicant. There was no evidence to support the applicant's claim of religious bias or animus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decision from the court of appeals was reversed, and a trial court's order granting summary disposition to the township entities was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant struck and killed a pedestrian. Defendant argued that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on proximate cause and that his conviction of operating a motor vehicle, causing death, based on the presence of 11-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-carboxy-THC) in his body was improper. The supreme court agreed. The victim was walking down the middle of the road, with his back to oncoming traffic, and was extremely intoxicated. The trial court abused its discretion by failing to admit evidence of the victim's intoxication because it was relevant to the element of causation in MCL 257.617(3) and MCL 257.625(4) and (8). In addition, defendant's conviction under MCL 257.625(4) and (8) was based on the court of appeal's improper interpretation of MCL 257.625(8). There was no known pharmacological effect of 11-carboxy-THC, 11-carboxy-THC was not a &quot;synthetic&quot; substance and, thus, it was not a schedule 1 controlled substance under MCL 333.7212(1)(d). Because 11-carboxy-THC was not a schedule 1 controlled substance under MCL 333.7212, a person could not be prosecuted under MCL 257.625(8) for operating a motor vehicle with any amount of 11-carboxy-THC in his system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed. Defendant's convictions were vacated and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Under MCL 791.238(2), defendant resumed serving his earlier sentence on the date he was arrested for the new criminal offense. As long as time remained on defendant's earlier sentence, he remained incarcerated, regardless of his eligibility for bond or his ability to furnish it. Because defendant was not being held in jail because of being denied or unable to furnish bond, the jail credit statute did not apply.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court noted that a quo warranto action brought by the Attorney General in the Michigan Court of Appeals was the only appropriate and exclusive proceeding to make the preliminary determination regarding whether the judge vacated or unlawfully held his judicial office. All evidence and testimony obtained during the proceeding by the JTC regarding whether the judge had vacated his office was obtained through an unconstitutional process because the JTC had no authority to proceed on the quo warranto issue or to determine whether the judge vacated his office. That determination could only be made by the Court of Appeals in a quo warranto proceeding, which could then be appealed to the supreme court. The supreme court did not have any constitutional authority to grant the JTC the authority and power to decide whether a judge vacated his or her office. The proper forum for the review of the JTC director's actions was the Attorney Grievance Commission (AGC). The judge's conduct did not rise to the level of judicial misconduct beyond requiring public censure. The judge did not intentionally lie under oath.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parents signed documents giving limited guardianship of their children to the children's aunt and uncle because the parents were in the throes of cocaine addiction. Subsequently, the aunt and uncle filed suit seeking legal and physical custody of the children. The circuit court awarded custody to the aunt and uncle, finding that the custodial presumption favored the aunt and uncle and that the parents were unfit. On review of the appellate court decision affirming the circuit court order, the court held that the established custodial environment presumption in MCL 722.27(1)(c) had to yield to the parental presumption in MCL 722.25(1) and that the parental presumption could be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that custody with the natural parents was not in the best interests of the children.  Due process did not require a threshold determination of parental fitness in custody cases, and the appellate court's decision in Mason v. Simmons, 267 Mich App 188, 704 NW2d 104 (2005), was overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After defendant began serving a prison term following a nolo contendere plea, the trial court imposed, inter alia, a court-appointed attorney's fee. Defendant's court-appointed appellate counsel moved to correct the sentence, arguing, inter alia, that the attorney fee was imposed without considering his ability to pay. The Court of Appeals of Michigan denied leave to appeal the trial court's denial of the motion. Defendant appealed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the procedure used to impose and enforce the court-appointed attorney fee. People v. Dunbar, 264 Mich. App. 240, 690 N.W.2d 476 (2004), wrongly held that a trial court was required to assess a convicted defendant's ability to pay before imposing such a fee. The ability-to-pay assessment was only constitutionally necessary when that imposition was enforced and a defendant contested his ability to pay. The ability-to-pay assessment was initially obviated under MCL 769.1l, in relation to imprisoned defendants, as the procedure created a presumption of nonindengcy. Here, the trial court did not err by imposing the fee for the court-appointed attorney without conducting an ability-to-pay analysis. Further, it did not err by issuing the remittance order under MCL 769.1l as defendant was presumed to be nonindigent if his prisoner account was only reduced by 50 percent of the amount over $ 50. However, if he contested his ability to pay that amount, he could ask to amend or revoke the remittance order. The trial court then had to decide whether a claim of extraordinary financial circumstances rebutted the statutory presumption of nonindigency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court terminated respondent father's parental rights to his daughter. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) reversed and remanded the trial court's judgment terminating the father's parental rights because he was not given notice about the proceedings, which violated his due process rights. Appellant, the Michigan Department of Human Services (DHS), sought leave to appeal in the Michigan Supreme Court, and leave was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Although the DHS had the father's correct address on file and the trial court used it successfully on one occasion, the trial court reverted, without explanation, to an address where mail had previously been returned as undeliverable. Also, the father was not properly identified, notified, and consulted regarding the initial service plan, the updated service plan, and the hearing to terminate his parental rights as required by MCR 3.965(B)(1) and (E) and MCL 722.954a(2). Furthermore, based on the failure of the trial court and the DHS to notify the father of the proceedings when it was aware of his current address, the father was not provided a meaningful opportunity to participate in the proceedings and he was deprived of his minimal right to procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Const. 1963, art I, &sect; 17. In addition, pursuant to MCL 712A.19b(3)(g) and (j), no one evaluated the father and his lifestyle and whether, based on his past criminal history, he presented a danger to his daughter. Thus, the trial court erred in terminating the father's parental rights to his daughter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After pleading guilty, defendant failed to request appointed counsel or file a direct appeal. At issue was whether the Halbert decision should be applied retroactively to cases in which a defendant's conviction had become final. The supreme court concluded that Halbert did constitute a new rule. The supreme court further concluded that Halbert could not be construed as a watershed decision, neither of the Teague exceptions applied, and Halbert was not retroactive under federal retroactivity jurisprudence. To determine whether Halbert should be applied retroactively under state law, the supreme court considered the following three factors: (1) the purpose of the new rule; (2) the general reliance on the old rule; (3) the effect of retroactive application of the new rule on the administration of justice. The supreme court concluded that although retroactive application of Halbert would potentially provide a small number of defendants with relief, this did not outweigh the certainty that by applying Halbert retroactively many guilty pleading defendants would inundate the appeals process. Halbert should not be applied retroactively to cases in which a conviction had become final.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient suffered a ruptured aneurysm and underwent emergency surgery, which led to the amputation of both legs. The patient brought this medical-malpractice suit on the theory that a negligent diagnosis resulted in the rupture and all resulting harm. The award from the trial court was approximately $1.9 million. The Court of Appeals affirmed and agreed with the trial court that, on the issue of &quot;loss of opportunity,&quot; the patient had met the requirements of MCL 600.2912a(2) because he had gone from a 95 percent chance of attaining a good result to a 10 percent chance of attaining a good result. On further review, the justices affirmed the Court of Appeals decision, but for varying reasons. A majority concluded that this was not a lost opportunity case. From there, the justices had differing opinions as to whether MCL 600.2912a(2) was enforceable and whether the Fulton case was good law with respect to the lost opportunity doctrine. The lead opinion concluded that MCL 600.2912a(2) was unenforceable and that Fulton was not good law. However, because a majority held that this was not a lost opportunity case, the issue of the correctness of Fulton could not be reached.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court held that the circuit court erred when it issued the preliminary injunction preventing the implementation of the restructuring plan. The circuit court issued what amounted to a permanent injunction where the underlying merits of the alleged status quo violation would never be resolved, contrary to the requirements of MCR 3.310(A)(5). The supreme court further held that, when a safety claim was alleged, an employer's challenged action altered the status quo during the pendency of an Act 312 arbitration only if the action was so inextricably intertwined with safety that the action would alter a condition of employment. The trial court had to determine whether the union had satisfied the traditional four-part test for a preliminary injunction, particularly that the union had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits that the plan was inextricably intertwined with safety and made a showing of irreparable harm. Second, if the circuit court issued the injunction there had to be a determination on the merits that the challenged employer action was inextricably intertwined with safety.</SPAN></P>

A non-contested case encompassed administrative determinations that did not fall within the definition of a contested case in MCL 24.203(3).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a partial condemnation proceeding, plaintiff state agency appealed a judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals that held that the exclusion of general effects damages in MCL 213.70(2) was unconstitutional because it impermissibly conflicted with the established constitutional meaning of &quot;just compensation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state agency initiated partial condemnation proceedings against defendant landowners for a highway project. While the landowners did not contest property value, they claimed additional damages to their remaining land attributable to the dust, dirt, noise, vibration, and smell of the highway. The state agency moved for summary judgment, arguing that general effects damages were not recoverable under MCL 213.70(2). The trial court granted summary judgment, but the appellate court reversed. On review, the court held that the appellate court erred in finding MCL 213.70(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The phrase &quot;just compensation&quot; was to be given the same meaning as that used by those sophisticated in the law when Const. 1963, art 10, &sect; 2, was ratified in 1963, and there was no reported Michigan case awarding general effects damages before 1963. Because there was negligible direct pre-1963 caselaw or other evidence establishing that the ratifiers of the state constitution in 1963 understood that a taking included the recovery of general effects damages and because there was some evidence to the contrary, there was insufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

Both the State and defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of assaulting and killing his elderly neighbor. On appeal, the court determined that convicting and sentencing a defendant for both first-degree felony murder and the predicate felony did not necessarily violate the multiple punishments strand of the Double Jeopardy Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V. or Const. 1963, art. 1, &sect; 15. In addition, the court overruled People v Wilder, 411 Mich 328, 308 NW2d 112 (1981) and held that the Blockburger test was applicable to the multiple punishments strand. Under the Blockburger test, convictions of two criminal offenses arising from the same act were prohibited only when the greater offense necessarily included all elements of the lesser offense. Accordingly, conviction of both offenses was precluded only where it was impossible to commit the greater offense without first having committed the lesser offense. Because each of the offenses for which defendant was convicted, felony murder and first-degree criminal sexual conduct, contained an element that the other did not, they were not the same offense and, therefore, defendant could be punished for both.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the part of the appellate court's judgment vacating the first-degree criminal sexual conduct conviction and sentence, reinstated the conviction and sentence, and denied defendant's application for leave to appeal the judgment of the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

The pertinent question in determining whether a union was similar to marriage was not whether it gave rise to all the same legal effects as marriage but whether it was being recognized as similar to marriage &quot;for any purpose.&quot; Domestic partnerships were similar to marriage because they were the only relationships in Michigan defined in terms of both gender and lack of a close blood connection. When public employers provided health-insurance benefits on the basis of the domestic partnership, they were without a doubt recognizing the partnership. An election brochure indicating that the amendment would not preclude employers from offering benefits to domestic partners could not be used to contradict the unambiguous language of the provision, and other states' provisions were too different for their interpretations to be of persuasive value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff insured filed an action concerning an underinsured motorist claim. Defendant insurer moved for summary disposition. A trial court denied the insurer's motion and granted summary disposition to the insured. The Court of Appeals, Michigan, affirmed, holding that the trial court had correctly ruled that the contractual limitations period was tolled. The instant court granted the insurer's application for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision solely on the basis of its conclusion that the limitations period was tolled pursuant to Tom Thomas. The instant court's caselaw had already declared that Tom Thomas was wrongly decided. The instant court found that express limitations periods in optional insurance contracts were not automatically tolled as a matter of law by filing a claim. Under the plain language of the contract, the insured was required to bring an action against the insurer within one year of an accident, unless she could point to a legally supported reason why that deadline was not effective. The trial court erred in ruling that the phrase &quot;legal action&quot; was ambiguous. Waiver was inapplicable because the insurer did not voluntarily relinquish its right to enforce the one-year time limit. The factual finding that the insurer caused delays was insufficient to grant estoppel because the insured had not shown any reliance on the insurer's conduct or statements. Because the contract unambiguously and not unreasonably required suit to be filed within one year of the accident, the insurer properly denied the claim when the insured failed to meet that deadline.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff developers sued defendant town, alleging that an increase in their property tax assessments based on the public-service improvements violated Const. 1963, art 9, &sect; 3, as amended by Mich. Proposal A (1994). The Court of Appeals of Michigan affirmed the trial court, concluding that the term additions did not refer to the public-service improvements that were to ultimately vest in the town or a utility company. The town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">MCL 211.34d(1)(b)(viii) was unconstitutional because the mere installation of public-service improvements on public property or on utility easements did not constitute a taxable &quot;addition,&quot; as that term was understood when the public adopted Const. 1963, art 9, &sect; 3, as amended by Mich. Proposal A (1994) (Proposal A). The definition of &quot;addition&quot; found in MCL 211.34d(1)(a), as adopted by the legislature in 1993, reflected the meaning of the term &quot;addition&quot; as understood by those sophisticated in the law at the time Proposal A was adopted. Thus, the lower court properly held that MCL 211.34d(1)(b)(viii) was unconstitutional because it was inconsistent with the meaning of the term &quot;additions&quot; as used in Proposal A and that public-service improvements did not constitute &quot;additions&quot; to property within the meaning of Proposal A. However, the lower court erred in defining ambiguous. The lower court also mistakenly concluded that taxing property on the basis of the value added by the availability of public services and also taxing utility lines as personal property of the utility companies resulted in double taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was affirmed to the extent the lower court held that the statute was unconstitutional, but was vacated to the extent the lower court defined the term ambiguous and concluded that taxing property on the basis of the value added by the availability of public services and also taxing utility lines as personal property of the utility companies resulted in double taxation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff developer appealed the denial of his request for a billboard variance by the zoning board of appeals (ZBA), claiming it was a taking.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court found that the developer's claim of appeal pursuant to MCL 125.585(11) was not a &quot;pleading&quot; for purposes of MCR 2.110(A). As the city acknowledged, the joinder rules of MCR 2.203 therefore did not apply to a claim of appeal from the decision of a zoning board of appeals. The decision of the circuit court on appeal from the zoning board of appeals' denial of a use variance was not res judicata on the developer's constitutional claims. The zoning board of appeals did not have jurisdiction to decide the developer's substantive due process and takings claims. Under MCL 125.585(11), the circuit court's review was confined to the record and decision of the zoning board of appeals. Therefore, the circuit court could not rule on takings issues in the developer's appeal. The Court of Appeals and the circuit court erred in relying on the rationale of the unpublished decision in Sammut v City of Birmingham.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, the State of Michigan and the Secretary of the State of Michigan, challenged a decision from the Michigan Court of Appeals, which entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, several objectors and a consulting firm, in a dispute over the constitutionality of MCL 168.615c. A motion for a stay had been filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">MCL 168.615c provided that information collected about voters at a presidential primary was disseminated to political parties. After MCL 168.615c was enacted, it was contended that it violated Const. 1963, art 4, &sect; 30 because there was a vote of less than two-thirds of the members of each house of the legislature. The court of appeals entered judgment for the objectors and the firm, and this appeal followed. In reversing the court of appeals, the supreme court held that there was no appropriation for a private purpose. In this case, political parties unquestionably served a public purpose. Whether the costs of permitting access to that information was warranted in light of the benefits was a matter primarily for a legislative determination. The supreme court disagreed with the court of appeals' determination that the public purpose served was merely incidental. The predominant role played by political parties was to inform the public about candidates and to facilitate public debate in the context of such candidates. Therefore, MCL 168.615c did not violate Const. 1963, art 4, &sect; 30 or Const. 1963, art 2, &sect; 4. Finally, there was standing in the case, and it was ripe for review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decision of the court of appeals was reversed. The case was remanded to a circuit court for entry of an order denying the motions filed by the objectors and the firm and dismissing the complaint. The motion for a stay was denied as moot.</SPAN></P>

The court construed the provision to mean that it was not each individual library facility that had to be made available, but rather public libraries as an entity or as an institution that had to be made available. The legislature sufficiently met its obligation of making the library institution &quot;available&quot; through the enactment of numerous laws which encouraged local control of libraries and the establishment of a borrowing system.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants argued that because the guidelines minimum sentence ranges called for intermediate sanctions under MCL 769.31(b), 769.34(4), the intermediate sanctions became the relevant statutory maximum sentence under Blakely, and therefore they were constitutionally entitled to such sanctions, and therefore the trial courts erred by sentencing them to indeterminate prison terms. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that because Michigan had a true indeterminate sentencing system in which the sentencing guidelines were used only to determine a defendant's minimum sentence, an intermediate sanction did not constitute a maximum sentence under Blakely. The court affirmed the first defendant's sentence because his record of bench warrants, his three parole revocations, and his history of absconding from parole constituted substantial and compelling reasons to sentence him to the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections. The court affirmed the second defendant's sentence because he admitted that he had touched a young woman's buttocks and then harassed and intimidated the two young women while on probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">One of three companion cases involving the application of Blakely v. Washington to Michigan's sentencing scheme was returned to the court following a remand from the United States Supreme Court for further consideration in light of the Court's holding in Cunningham v. California.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Cunningham opinion did not alter the court's view that Michigan's statutory scheme required the sentencing court to score both offense variables (OVs) and prior record variables (PRVs) before determining the defendant's minimum sentence. A defendant's qualification for an intermediate sanction was contingent on the sentencing court's calculation and application of such sentencing variables. A sentencing court's fact-finding in scoring the OVs did not increase a defendant's statutory maximum under Blakely. The proper scoring of both the OVs and the PRVs did not place defendant in an intermediate sanction cell. Instead, defendant's scores placed him in a &quot;straddle cell&quot; with a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. Defendant was sentenced within that statutory maximum. Michigan had a true indeterminate sentencing scheme. Even if defendant were to be sentenced on the basis of his PRV score alone, the sentencing court would not have violated Blakely by sentencing him to the statutory maximum of 15 years in prison. Moreover, any such error would have been harmless. The factors underlying the scoring of the OVs were uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the original sentence.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the search warrant was constitutional under the Fourth Amendment because, even accepting the appellate court's determination that the anonymous tip was unreliable, the marijuana from the trash provided a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed, and therefore the evidence found in defendants' home was not subject to the exclusionary rule. The court held that there was no violation of MCL 780.653 because the search warrant affidavit was based on the affiant's personal efforts to search the trash and discover the marijuana because that evidence was the foundation for probable cause. While the anonymous tip prompted the officers' investigation of defendants, the affidavit was not based on that information but rather was based on the trash pull.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, the personal representative of the landlord's estate and a management company, appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Michigan that reversed summary judgment under MCR 2.116(C)(7) that was entered for defendants in a wrongful death action filed by plaintiff personal representative of the victim's estate on the ground that the common-law discovery rule tolled the limitations period for all of plaintiff's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The victim, who rented a house on the landlord's property, was raped and murdered by the employee of a company that serviced the sprinkler system. Sixteen years later after the murderer was identified plaintiff sued defendants. The appellate court denied defendants summary judgment, holding that the three-year statute of limitations of MCL 600.5805(10) was tolled by the common-law discovery rule. On appeal, the court held that the plain language of MCL 600.5827 precluded the use of a common-law discovery rule to the accrual date of claims to which the statute applied. Because the wrong was done when the victim was raped and murdered in 1986, and MCL 600.5827 was in effect at that time, plaintiff's claims accrued at the time of her death, and therefore were barred by the three-year statute of limitations. The court did not deprive plaintiff of due process by holding that the claims were time-barred because the statutes furthered a legitimate legislative aim, namely relieving defendants of the burden of defending claims brought after the time established. Because plaintiff did not detrimentally rely on confusing pre-existing case law, the court declined to employ equitable tolling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Review was limited to whether plaintiffs had standing to bring a claim under MEPA as that claim related to certain streams, lakes, and wetlands. Plaintiffs indisputably had standing to bring a MEPA claim as to those areas in which the property owners enjoyed riparian rights, and the individual members with riparian rights conferred organizational standing on the group. However, plaintiffs had no use, access, nor recreational, aesthetic, or economic interest in other areas, and thus, they had no substantial interest in those areas detrimentally affected by the company's pumping activities that was distinct from the interest of the general public. The absence of a concrete, particularized injury in fact was fatal to their standing. The court rejected the &quot;interconnectedness&quot; theory of standing. No matter how pervasive the environmental damage in an ecosystem, plaintiffs still had to successfully and succinctly establish their injury in fact. Neither Const 1963, art 4, &sect; 52, nor MCL 324.1701(1) lightened the burden to satisfy traditional standing requirements. The potential effect of the remedy was not to be confused with plaintiffs' constitutional burden to prove standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted for sexually assaulting the victim, a student. Defendant was charged with CSC I. After acquitting defendant of that charge, it sua sponte convicted defendant of CSC II. On appeal, the court held that CSC II was not a necessarily included lesser offense of CSC I because the elements of CSC II were not all subsumed within CSC I, as CSC II required proof of one of several intents that were not always present when CSC I was committed; therefore, CSC II was a cognate lesser offense. MCL 768.32(1) precluded a judge or jury from convicting a defendant of a cognate lesser offense even if the crime was divided into degrees because the word &quot;inferior&quot; in MCL 768.32(1) was best understood as meaning an offense that was necessarily included in the greater charge. Because all of the elements of CSC II were not included within CSC I, the trial court was without authority to convict defendant of CSC II after it acquitted him of CSC I. Therefore, the appellate court properly vacated defendant's conviction and remanded the case for an order of discharge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Michigan House of Representatives requested an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of MCL 168.523.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">MCL 168.523(1) was facially constitutional under the United States Constitution because the obligation of either presenting photo identification or signing an affidavit was not a severe burden on the right to vote. The statute imposed only a reasonable, nondiscriminatory restriction on the election process in furtherance of Michigan's compelling regulatory interest in preventing voter fraud and enforcing Const. 1963, art 2, &sect; 4, to preserve the purity of elections and to guard against abuses of the elective franchise by ensuring that lawful voters did not have their votes diluted. Michigan's Equal Protection Clause did not compel that every election regulation be reviewed under strict scrutiny. Rather, the flexible Burdick test was used as it struck the appropriate balance between protecting a citizen's right to vote and protecting against fraudulent voting. Because no voter was required to incur the costs of obtaining a photo identification card as a condition of voting, the statute did not impose the payment of a fee as a condition to the exercise of the franchise and therefore was not an unconstitutional poll tax under U.S. Const. amend. XXIV.</SPAN></P>

The claimant was cited for speeding and driving on a suspended license. The state filed a complaint for forfeiture of the cash. Evidence of the backpack and its contents were suppressed on the basis that their seizure was illegal. The court agreed with the court of appeals that the circuit court did not clearly err in finding that, although the cash was illegally seized, there was a preponderance of untainted evidence to support a finding of civil forfeiture, pursuant to MCL 333.7521(1)(f), including the claimant's unexplained and repeated history of using rental cars and her inconsistent testimony as to why she had such a large amount of cash in the rental car in relation to her reported income and while traveling a known drug corridor. The exclusionary rule was not meant to immunize illegally seized property from a civil forfeiture proceeding involving that property. The court held that, in accord with MCL 333.7521, as long as the forfeiture was established by a preponderance of evidence untainted by the illegal search and seizure, the forfeiture was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The church wanted to build an apartment complex across the street from its church on property that it owned in the city. There were single-family residences on each side of the property. The issue presented was whether 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc et seq., entitled the church to the rezoning of its property from single-family residential to multiple-family residential to allow the church to build an apartment complex. The next question was whether the building of an apartment complex constituted a religious exercise. The supreme court concluded that a refusal to rezone did not constitute an individualized assessment, and, thus, that RLUIPA was inapplicable. Further, even if RLUIPA was applicable, the building of an apartment complex did not constitute a religious exercise. Even if it did constitute a religious exercise, the city's refusal to rezone the church's property did not substantially burden the church's religious exercise. If it did substantially burden religious exercise, the imposition of that burden was in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and constituted the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. The RLUIPA was not violated.</SPAN></P>

In partially reversing, the supreme court determined that the amendatory provision of the compacts and the Governor's exercise of that provision did not violate the separation of powers clause because the amendatory provision was properly approved by legislative resolution. Moreover, the Governor's use of the amendatory provision was exercised within the constitutional limits.

The court held that MCL 691.1404(1) was not unconstitutional because it did not require that the government be prejudiced by late notice. Because the statute was constitutional, engrafting the prejudice requirement onto it was unlawful. The court further held that its decision had full retroactive effect. Because the pedestrian failed to provide notice within 120 days of her fall, her claim was barred by MCL 691.1404(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer sued defendant Revenue Division, Department of Treasury, State of Michigan, challenging taxes allegedly owed under the Single Business Tax Act, MCL 208.1 et seq. The Michigan Court of Appeals held that services performed outside of Michigan for construction projects located in Michigan were taxable thereunder, but that the statute violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 cl. 3. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayer asserted that MCL 208.53(c) deemed receipts for services taxable as Michigan receipts only if the services were performed within Michigan. The state supreme court disagreed, however, finding that the statute established a two-part analysis. The taxpayer engaged in architectural and engineering services for Michigan construction projects. Because those activities constituted &quot;services performed&quot; for &quot;construction activities,&quot; and those &quot;construction activities&quot; took place &quot;within this state,&quot; the State could tax the services. The taxpayer's attempt to construe its services as planning or design activities failed to recognize that it performed its services for construction activities within Michigan. Moreover, the supreme court held that the statute was constitutional. The receipts at issue were for services provided for Michigan projects; thus, the incidence of the tax, as well as its measure, was tied to the earnings that the State had made possible, meaning that there was a substantial nexus between the state and the activity being taxed. Further, because &sect; 208.53 did not discriminate against interstate commerce, it did not violate the &quot;internal consistency&quot; test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The supreme court affirmed in part but reversed in part with regard to the analysis of fair apportionment. It remanded to the state appellate court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State challenged a decision of the Court of Appeals (Michigan) that affirmed the trial court judgment that held dismissal was a proper remedy for the denial of defendant's right under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625a(6)(d) to an independent chemical test of his bodily alcohol level (BAL) after defendant was arrested for operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor (OUIL) or with an unlawful BAL under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State challenged the court of appeals decision that held dismissal was the proper remedy when a defendant was denied his right to a reasonable opportunity for an independent BAL chemical test under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625a(6)(d). The court found that the text of &sect; 257.625a(6)(d) did not reflect that the Legislature intended either dismissal or suppression of the evidence to be the remedy for a violation of &sect; 257.625a(6)(d); thus the court could not create a remedy that only the Legislature had the power to create. The court held that because &sect; 257.625(d) did not specify a remedy, dismissal or the suppression of the evidence was not a proper remedy for a violation of &sect; 257.625a(6)(d); rather the proper remedy was a permissive instruction informing the jury of the violation and allowing it to determine the significance of that fact. Accordingly the court overruled People v Koval, 371 Mich. 453, 124 N.W.2d 274 (1963), and its progeny, that held dismissal was a proper remedy. The Court also held that defendant's due process right to present a defense was not violated because the police had no constitutional duty to assist defendant in developing potentially exculpatory evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the court of appeals judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for reinstatement of the charges against defendant. The court noted that the results of the police-administered chemical test would be admissible at trial , but the trial court could instruct the jury that the police violated defendant's statutory right to a reasonable opportunity for an independent chemical test.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that the rules were designed to prohibit only undignified, discourteous, and disrespectful conduct or remarks, and not to silence or censor. Further, the case was still pending when the remarks were made because it was during the period in which a motion for rehearing could be filed under Mich. Ct. R. 7.302(C)(2)(c). Indeed, the attorney ultimately did file a timely motion for rehearing. Also, even though made outside a courtroom, the statements attacked the judges in their capacity as judges, and Mich. Prof. Cond. R. 6.5(a) applied as the judges were persons involved in an ongoing legal process. The rules were not vague as there was no question that even the most casual reading of these rules would put a person on notice that the kind of language used by the attorney would violate Mich. Prof. Cond. R. 3.5(c) and 6.5(a). Further, the speech was not political under the First Amendment as there was no political campaign underway.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State appealed judgments of the Court of Appeals of Michigan in two consolidated cases holding that 11-carboxy-THC was not a schedule one controlled substance under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7212 in defendants' criminal cases charging them with driving under the influence under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625(8).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, in two different cases, were charged with operating a motor vehicle with the presence of a schedule one controlled substance in their bodies in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625(8). Both admitted to having smoked marijuana before their auto accidents, and blood tests showed the presence of 11-carboxy-THC, a by-product or metabolite of marijuana. On appeal of the appellate court's decision, the court held that because 11-carboxy-THC qualified as a derivative, and since derivatives were included within the definition of marijuana, which Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 333.7212(1)(c) specifically listed as a schedule one controlled substance, 11-carboxy-THC was a schedule one controlled substance under &sect; 333.7212(1)(c) for the purpose of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625(8). The court further held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625(4), (5), and (8) did not require proof of a defendant's knowledge of his or her intoxication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, ordered oral argument on whether to grant defendant's application for leave to appeal a judgment of the Oakland Circuit Court (Michigan) that sentenced him to 2 to 15 years in prison upon his conviction for assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.84. Defendant claimed he was entitled to an intermediate sentence under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 769.34(4)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant claimed he was entitled to an intermediate sanction, rather than a prison term, because his prior record variable (PRV) score alone placed him in a recommended minimum guidelines range of 0 to 11 months, which was within the 18 month upper limit for an intermediate sentence under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 769.34(4)(a).  Defendant also claimed that the trial court violated the Blakely rule by engaging in judicial fact-finding to score the offense variables (OVs). The court noted that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 777.21 explicitly required the trial court to consider the OVs, the PRVs, and the offense class to determine a defendant's recommended minimum guidelines range. The court held that when defendant's OVs, PRVs, and offense class were considered, his minimum sentence range was 5 to 28 months; thus he was not entitled to an intermediate sanction under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 769.34(4)(a). The court held that the trial court did not violate the Blakely rule by scoring the OVs before imposing a prison sentence within the guidelines, and that its holding was consistent with Ring v. Arizona because defendant's statutory maximum sentence was not increased on the basis of judicial findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed defendant's sentence.

The legislature created the MPSC under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 460.6 and gave it broad regulatory authority over public utilities. The court deferred to the MPSC and its primary jurisdiction on the question as to whether the city's ordinance conflicted with MPSC regulations. The court reaffirmed the standard that a municipality could regulate highways, streets, alleys, and public places to the degree such regulations were consistent with state law. The court did agree that the MPSC had no jurisdiction to consider the scope of the city's constitutional authority.</SPAN></P>

The corporation was a charitable institution under Mich. Comp.

Comp. Laws &sect; 750.316(1)(b), with home invasion in the first degree, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.110a, as the predicate felony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A homeowner confronted defendant in the doorway of his home and defendant fled in his car. An officer gave chase, then defendant's vehicle had a head-on collision with the victims. The court reversed and held that &quot;perpetration&quot; as used in the felony-murder statute contemplated something beyond the definitional elements of the predicate felony. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict of acquittal because a reasonable juror could conclude that defendant was still in the midst of his escape from the home invasion when he struck the victims. The scene of the murders was sufficiently close in both time and distance from the scene of the home invasion. Also, the trial court did not err in failing to instruct on involuntary manslaughter because no rational juror could conclude that defendant's actions were anything other than acts that created a very high risk of death or great bodily harm with knowledge that death or great bodily harm was the probable result, given that defendant knowingly entered an interstate highway going the wrong way.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Oakland Circuit Court, Michigan, denied defendant insurer's motion for partial summary judgment on plaintiff mother's complaint seeking payment for services allegedly rendered for which she did not receive payment. The Michigan Court of Appeals denied the insurer's leave to appeal, which was subsequently granted by the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The insurer asked that the supreme court overrule a prior case and apply as written the &quot;one-year-back&quot; limitation provided for in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3145(1) for recovering no-fault personal protection insurance benefits. The supreme court found there was a plainly expressed legislative intent that recovery of personal injury protection (PIP) be limited to losses incurred within the year prior to the filing of the lawsuit. The mother had a full year following the February 2001 termination of payment for home health-care benefits within which to seek reimbursement. The mother's ability to file suit was not thwarted by dilatory tactics on the part of the insurer or by the exercise of the insurer's right to delay payment for 30 days following receipt of proof of loss. The supreme court's decision was to be given retroactive effect and was applicable to all pending cases. There was no allegation of fraud, mutual mistake, or any other unusual circumstance; thus, there was no basis to invoke the supreme court's equitable power. Therefore, the mother's claim was barred by the one-year back rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and remanded for entry of an order of partial summary disposition in favor of the insurer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court of appeals held that the state held title to previously submerged land, subject to the exclusive use of the riparian owner up to the water's edge and that no member of the public had a right to traverse the land between the statutory ordinary high water mark and the literal water's edge. The court noted that the public trust doctrine applied to the great lakes and reversed the judgment of the court of appeals. The court held that the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act (GLSLA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 324.32501 et seq., reiterated the state's authority as trustee of the inalienable jus publicum, which extended over both publicly and privately owned lands and that the GLSLA made no claims to alter the delineation of the jus privatum of individual landowners, although the two could overlap. The court of appeals erred by granting defendants exclusive right of use down to the water's edge because littoral property remained subject to the public trust and their rights superseded public rights only to the extent that they did not contravene the public trust. The court concluded that plaintiff could walk the shores of the lake below the ordinary high water mark.</SPAN></P>

The state insurance commissioner had approved the insurer's policy form containing the shortened limitations provision for issuance and use in the State of Michigan.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In consolidated appeals, defendants challenged decisions of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which affirmed their convictions for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor and causing death (OUIL causing death), under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625(4). The court revisited its decision in People v Lardie, 452 Mich. 231 (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant one had a 0.16 blood-alcohol level (BAL), was driving erratically, and had an accident that killed the passenger. Defendant two had a .10 BAL, and hit and killed a girl on a bicycle. The court held that the Lardie court's reliance on policy considerations in construing Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.625(4) was misplaced and that &sect; 257.625(4) plainly required that the victim's death be caused by defendant's operation of the vehicle, not defendant's intoxicated operation. As to defendant one, any error of the trial court in merely reading the statute and failing to explain the causation element of OUIL causing death was harmless, but the case was remanded for a determination as to whether the trial court committed reversible error by referring to defendant's stipulation as to his BAL. As to defendant two, the issue of causation was less certain because while there was evidence that the victim's death was the direct result of defendant's operation of the vehicle, the victim rode a bicycle without brakes down a hill onto a busy road. The court overturned Laridie to the extent that it held that a defendant's intoxicated driving must be a substantial cause of the vicitm's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">As to defendant one, the court vacated the judgment and remanded to address defendant's remaining argument. As to defendant two, the court reversed and remanded for reconsideration of whether to bind defendant over on the charge of OUIL causing death in light of the principles set forth in this opinion.</SPAN></P>

The owners filed a motion challenging the public purpose and necessity of the taking pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 213.56 of Michigan's Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 231.51 et seq. The trial court concluded that the proposed taking was unconstitutional, and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed. The city sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On review, the city contended that the &quot;spur road&quot; part of the project constituted a public use and that the property owners did not successfully challenge the necessity of the project. The supreme court agreed, finding that the city initiated the project in response to growing traffic problems, and that ownership, control, and maintenance would remain with the city. The public would be free to use the spur, and although a nearby business would be the primary user of the spur, it was the right of travel by all the world, and not the exercise of the right, which made the spur a public highway. The business was to be granted no interest in the property and would have no ability to control access to the road. As such, the supreme court found that the proposed project was a public road, and thus a public use; thus, the lower courts erred in ruling otherwise. Contrary to the owners' assertions, fraud did not provide them a basis for relief because the requisite elements were not supported by the record. Further, the city was not obligated to show that its plan was the best or only alternative, only that it was a reasonable one; the owners did not show that the plan was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decision that the proposed road was not a public use was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court for entry of summary disposition in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The retirees alleged that the copay and deductible increases violated Mich.

The court held that health care benefits were not protected by Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 24 because they were not accrued benefits or financial benefits as those terms were commonly understood at the time of ratification; thus, they did not constitute accrued financial benefits. The court further held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 38.1391(1) did not give public school employees a contractual right to health care benefits because the plain language of the statute did not clearly indicate that the legislature intended to surrender its legislative powers through the statute's enactment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In consolidated appeals, plaintiffs, townships and residents of those townships who sought to detach territory from defendant cities, sought review of decisions from the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which denied mandamus relief to compel state approval of detachment elections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In one case, the proposed election would have allowed residents of one township to vote on a change in the boundaries of another township in which they did not reside. In the other case, the petition involved an effort to detach territory for addition to more than one township. The court held that the refusal to certify the petitions was proper because a petition and a vote about detachment could involve only one city and one township. Pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 117.6, 117.8(1), and 117.11(2), detachment had to be approved by qualified electors, as defined in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 168.10, of the district to be affected, as defined in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 117.9(1). Thus, residents of one township were not qualified electors in a detachment proceeding with respect to determining a change of boundaries for another township. The language of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 117.13 also suggested that the district to be affected could comprise only one city and one township. Moreover, combining multiple additions of territory in a single detachment petition so that there was only a single vote violated the prohibition of Mich. Comp.

The court of appeals found constitutional error in the admission of the plea transcript, and that it was not at all clear that a rational jury would have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt absent the improperly admitted statement. On appeal, the State argued that although the plea transcript was improperly admitted, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The supreme court held that on the basis of the overwhelming evidence of the falsity of defendant's testimony in the fleeing and eluding trial, it was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable jury would have found her guilty of perjury even if the transcript of her boyfriend's plea to the charge of subornation of perjury had not been admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant city council appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which affirmed the circuit court's decision for plaintiff police officer in his declaratory action contending that the city abused its discretion in denying his request for attorney fees to defend himself against criminal prosecution for what the officer contended was within the scope of his duty as an employee with the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The officer was certified to inspect salvage vehicles and was charged with falsifying a certification under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.903, and acquitted. The issue was whether the judiciary had the authority to review the city council's denial of the officer's request for reimbursement. The court held that the State, through &sect; 8 of the governmental immunity act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1408, had clearly conferred upon the city council the power which it exercised and left the exercise of it to the judgment and discretion of the council. Whether the council acted wisely or unwisely, prudently or imprudently, was not for the consideration or determination of the court. The officer did not suggest that the city council's decision was unconstitutional in any way. Nor was there any evidence in the record that would suggest such unconstitutionality. In overruling Exeter Township Clerk v. Exeter Township Board, 108 Mich. App. 262, 108 Mich. App. 262, and Bowens v. City of Pontiac, 165 Mich. App. 416, the court held that absent a showing that the governmental agency exercised its discretion in an unconstitutional manner, the court was without the power to review such decisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff trade association brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, challenging the constitutionality of the Michigan Prevailing Wage Act (PWA). The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court's denial of the governmental defendants' motion for summary disposition of the claim of unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority and affirmed the dismissal of the association's vagueness claim. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The association argued that the PWA was unconstitutionally vague and constituted an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to unions and union contractors. The appellate court concluded that the association could not seek declaratory relief because it had alleged no &quot;actual controversy&quot; under the court rule governing declaratory judgments, Mich. Ct. R. 2.605. However, the instant court held that the association presented an &quot;actual controversy&quot; and could seek declaratory relief under Rule 2.605. The association was not required to submit evidence of a threat of imminent prosecution in order to establish standing. It was sufficient to establish standing that the association's members were directly regulated by the PWA and were required to conform their pay and benefit practices to that of union contractors on state-funded projects. The affidavits submitted by the association articulated concrete risks of violations of the PWA. The risks of enforcement of the PWA, together with the asserted character of the potential for violations of the PWA, presented a justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The complaint alleged illegal discharges of pollutants into a river. The court of appeals ruled that the environmental groups had standing to seek injunctive relief as a remedy under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 324.1704(1). In affirming, the court emphasized the importance of standing as an aspect of the judicial power under Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect; 1 and of separation of powers under Mich. Const. art. 3, &sect; 2. The court found that the environmental groups sufficiently asserted injury to their members by averring that they used the affected area and were persons for whom the aesthetic and recreational values of the area would be lessened by the challenged activity. Such averments were adequate to allege injury in fact. The environmental groups also provided an affidavit from an expert, which discussed the effects of the pollution on groundwater flow, recharge rate, stream flow, and water quality, as well as the expected effects on birds, fish, and plants from habitat destruction. Because the court ruled that the environmental groups had standing without regard to Mich. Comp.

The court found that the county was authorized to condemn property under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 213.23 and that the creation of jobs was a public purpose within its authority. The county's charter provision regarding its authority, Wayne County, Mich., Charter &sect; 1.112, fell within the scope of its home rule powers under Mich. Const. art. 7, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 34 and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 45.515(c). The lack of an identified purchaser did not defeat a finding of necessity. The court concluded, however, that the proposed condemnation did not pass constitutional muster because the taking was not for public use within the meaning of Mich. Const. art. 10, &sect; 2. The park was not an enterprise dependent on the use of land that could be assembled only by government action. The park would not be subject to public oversight after being sold to private entities. There were no facts of independent public significance, such as health and safety issues, that might justify the condemnation. In so holding, the court overruled Poletown Neighborhood Council v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff anti-casino taxpayer group appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which reversed a circuit court decision and held that the Legislature's approval by resolution rather than by a bill of tribal-state gaming compacts under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2701 et seq., did not violate Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 22 and that the resolution was not a &quot;local act&quot; in violation of Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 29.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs challenged the court of appeals decision that held the Michigan Legislature's approval of the gaming compacts by resolution was not constitutionally infirm. The court held that the compacts were contracts and did not constitute legislation, as they contained no enforcement provision and the power of the state to legislate in this area was preempted by federal law. The court also found that the compacts did not impose any affirmative obligations on the state, create rules of conduct for Michigan citizens, or create new state agencies. The court held that the Legislature did not modify Michigan law, but merely expressed its approval of valid contracts between two independent, sovereign entities. The court also agreed that the resolution was not a &quot;local act.&quot; The court affirmed the judgment, but remanded plaintiffs' claim as to the compacts' amendment provision, because the court of appeals had found the issue was not ripe for review, but the Governor had since invoked the provision, and the lower courts had not yet reviewed the issue of whether it violated the separation of powers doctrine in Mich. Const. art. 3, &sect; 2 by allowing amendment without legislative approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the court of appeals judgment that held the tribal-state gaming compacts were not legislation and could be approved by resolution rather than by a bill and that the resolution was not a local act. The court remanded the issue of whether the amendatory provision of the compacts violated the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In two consolidated cases, the supreme court granted leave to appeal to consider whether plaintiffs satisfied the &quot;serious impairment of body function&quot; threshold set by the no-fault insurance act, Mich.

The trial courts granted defendants' motions for summary disposition, concluding that neither plaintiff had suffered a &quot;serious impairment of body function,&quot; but the appellate court reversed. The supreme court reversed that decision and reinstated the trial court's order, stating that neither plaintiff satisfied the &quot;serious impairment of body function&quot; threshold. The specific issue was whether plaintiffs' impairments affected their general ability to lead their normal lives. In regard to the first plaintiff, the supreme court stated that there was no medical evidence that he had any residual impairment or that the course of his life had been affected. Further, while the second plaintiff could not work to full capacity, he was generally able to lead his normal life.</SPAN></P>

Counsel maintained that, when he accessed the American Medical Association's web-site, he learned that the physician was only board certified in general surgery. As a result, for the affidavit of merit, counsel obtained a physician board-certified in general surgery who specialized in vascular surgery. In their motion for summary disposition, the physician and the hospital maintained that the expert was not qualified. At the moment the affidavit of merit was being prepared, plaintiff's attorney used the resources available to him and reasonably concluded that he had a match sufficient to meet the requirements for naming an expert. The expert was qualified for this stage of the litigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was confronted by police officers while he was carrying a firefighter's helmet and jacket. Defendant told a police officer that he was not a fireman, but was collecting money for firefighters in New York. Suspicious officers confiscated contributions given to defendant and obtained a search warrant to search his home where the search uncovered more firefighter paraphernalia, a firearm and marijuana. The state circuit court found the affidavit did not establish probable cause for the issuance of a warrant and dismissed the charges against defendant. After the appellate court denied leave to appeal, the state supreme court adopted a good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule in Michigan and reversed the state circuit court's ruling. Specifically, the state supreme court reasoned that excluding the evidence recovered in good-faith reliance on the warrant would not further the purpose of the exclusionary rule, i.e., to deter police misconduct and that adopting the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule in Michigan was consistent with the legislative intent not to place restrictions on law enforcement activity greater than those under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A trial court concluded that the damage caps of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.401(3), which capped the amount of a lessor's liability in motor vehicle leases of 30 days or less, were unconstitutional on the basis that capping damages violated the right of trial by jury found in Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue was whether Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.401(3)&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed the right of trial by jury because Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 made what the legislature attempted to do, cap damages even though a jury found that the damages were greater than the cap, unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Michigan held that the damages cap did not offend the passenger's constitutional right of trial by jury because the amount she actually received was never within those things a jury could decide. The supreme court also found that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.401(3) satisfied the rational basis test; it did not violate the rights granted by the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution because the legislation was rationally related to legitimate governmental interest. The statute was obviously designed to reduce insurance costs for automobile lessors, and because costs of operations were reduced, it increased the number of providers from which Michigan consumers could choose. Because the court found that &sect; 257.401(3) did not violate the passenger's rights under Michigan's Equal Protection Clause, it also found it did not violate her rights under Michigan's Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>

However, the statement was never introduced into evidence or referred to by the prosecution. On appeal, defendant argued that he decided not to testify based on the improper ruling by the trial court. The appellate court held that, while the ruling was improper, the evidence was not introduced, so defendant was not prejudiced. Defendant appealed. The court held that defendant failed to preserve the issue for appellate review. The court could not assume that defendant's failure to testify was motivated by the trial court's ruling.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Mich. Const. art 9, &sect; 29 contained two provisions requiring defendant State to adequately fund public education. Plaintiffs asserted a claim under the second provision, the &quot;prohibition on unfunded mandates&quot; (POUM) provision, which required the State to fund any new or increased activities. Plaintiffs filed three counts alleging increased or new activities without funding: (I) administrative rules that required new special education activities; (II) Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 380.1284 that required an increase annually in the hours of pupil instruction; and (III) 12 statutes and Exec. Order No. 2000-9 that required report-keeping activities. Some plaintiffs were involved in earlier suits involving special education funding. The court found that with the limited exception of certain count III claims, plaintiffs' claims were barred by res judicata or by a release and waiver executed pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 388.1611f that applied to claims and potential claims existing during the pendency of the earlier suit. The court reversed as to the finding that record-keeping requirements found in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 388.1752 and Exec. Order No. 2000-9 did not impose a new or increased mandate.</SPAN></P>

The court held that merely stating the principle of separation of powers provided no guidance regarding which powers belonged to which branch of government. Such was within the legislature's power to do. Through &sect; 769.34 the legislature implemented a comprehensive sentencing reform, under which it delegated various amounts of sentencing discretion to the judiciary through different statutes. The delegated authority included appellate review of sentences pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 769.34(7)-(12). The court was neither presented with nor found any persuasive argument for finding Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 769.34(10)&nbsp;unconstitutional.

The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, included a substantive component that protected the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children.

The trial court denied a stay, but allowed plaintiff landowners to intervene. The township and the landowners moved for summary disposition, which was denied based on Mich. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Before beginning construction of the new high school, the board of education met with township officials to discuss the effect of local zoning ordinances on its site plan. At issue on appeal was whether local school districts, which were required to submit building plans to the state superintendent of public instruction for approval pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 380.1263(3), must also comply with township zoning and planning ordinances pursuant to the Township Zoning Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.271 et seq., and the township planning act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.321, et seq. The supreme court concluded that the failure to join the state superintendent as a party precluded the court from resolving the claim. The Michigan Legislature vested sole and exclusive jurisdiction over school construction and site plans in the state superintendent, who had the approval authority for school construction and site plans submitted by the local school districts. This indicated an intention to immunize school districts from local ordinances, as they affected the content of a school site plan. The issue of delegation of authority was not properly before the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, the State, the Department of Management and Budget, Bureau of Retirement Services, and Judges Retirement Board (Michigan), sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeals (Michigan), which ruled in favor of plaintiff retired state district court judges and concluded that the Judges Retirement Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 38.2101 et seq., was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judges asserted that the Act, specifically Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 38.2104(1)(b), (d), 38.2108(3), (8), violated the Equal Protection Clause in Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 by providing a greater retirement allowance to 36th district court judges than to all others. The appellate court applied the intermediate scrutiny test and held that the Act was unconstitutional. The court reversed. In determining the proper level of scrutiny to apply, the court determined that the present state of both federal and Michigan equal protection jurisprudence failed to support application of the intermediate scrutiny test to statutes that created a discrete exception to a general rule, where the exception was no longer considered experimental. Accordingly, the court overruled the holding of Manistee Bank v. McGowan, 394 Mich. 655 (1975), to the extent that it created the &quot;discrete exception to a general rule&quot; basis for applying intermediate scrutiny, but affirmed its recognition of the existence of the intermediate scrutiny test. The Act provided for the pensions of the 36th district court judges to be more secure. Thus, the Act and the contested provisions were deemed constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the appellate court's decision and reinstated the trial court's judgment in defendants' favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Court of Appeals (Michigan) affirmed a circuit court's grant of a motion to suppress evidence obtained through a search warrant obtained in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.653 in pretrial proceedings against defendant one. The Court of Appeals also affirmed a circuit court's reversal of a district court's denial of defendant two's motion to suppress evidence based on a violation of Mich. Ct. R. 3.606. The State appealed both judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In defendant one's case, the affidavit for a search warrant did not meet the requirements of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.653(B) because it did not include information concerning the credibility of the unnamed informants or the reliability of the information they supplied. In defendant's two's case, the circuit court held that although the failure to provide an affidavit with a bench warrant petition for defendant two's arrest was merely technical, it rendered the bench warrant invalid. Without addressing the constitutionality of the warrants, on appeal the court addressed only whether the exclusionary rule was properly applied to evidence seized in each case and held that the mere technical violations at issue did not mandate application of the exclusionary rule. Neither the statute nor the rule at issue specifically stated that such violations required exclusion of evidence obtained under the warrants. Additionally, the court held that applying the rule would not further the purpose of deterring wrongful police conduct because in both cases the officers had acted in good faith in obtaining the warrants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the intermediate appellate court's judgment in both cases. Regarding defendant one's case, the court remanded to matter to the intermediate appellate court to address the State's additional arguments on appeal. Regarding defendant two's case, the court remanded the matter to the district court division for further proceedings. The court did not retain jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Court of Appeals (Michigan) reversed in part the trial court's condemnation award to appellee landowner and held that the Uniform Condemnation Procedures Act (UCPA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 213.51 et seq., gave no authority to a court to consider any contamination factor in the establishment of fair market value. The court granted leave to appeal to consider appellant drain district's claim to the contrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowner operated a plastics extruding business and owned a parcel of land adjacent to its plant. The landowner was denied a permit to build on the parcel, as the district wanted to build a storm-water retention pond thereon. In considering the value of the land, the trial court took into account the contamination factor of the land and determined the reasonable cost of the land accordingly. The appellate court reversed in part and disagreed with the trial court's valuation. The court reversed on appeal. The court considered the meaning of the term &quot;just compensation&quot; as used in Mich. Const. art. X, &sect; 2. The court found that the term was a phrase of art that meant that the proper amount of compensation for property took into account all factors relevant to market value, and it was this meaning that was attributed to the drafters of state constitution and the UCPA. The appellate court erred in analyzing the term under the plain language doctrine. Thus, the trial court properly considered the contamination factor in determining the fair market value of the parcel, and further proceedings were ordered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the part of the appellate court's decision that held that the UCPA did not vest courts with the authority to consider contamination and how it affected fair market value in a condemnation proceeding. The court affirmed the remainder of the decision and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

During the resulting incarceration, defendant assaulted a corrections officer.

Based on that reversal, defendant sought relief from the conviction for the assault charge, claiming that he was not lawfully imprisoned, as required by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.197c. The court held that the reversal of defendant's conviction for the weapon offense, reversed by application of the exclusionary rule, did not mean that defendant was not lawfully imprisoned, as contemplated by Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.197c. The concealed weapon offense was committed in an officer's presence; therefore, Mich. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Workers' Compensation Appellate Commission granting judgment in favor of plaintiff employee by concluding that the fact that the employee was no longer able to work for defendant employer as a result of the employee's commission of a crime did not relieve the employer of its responsibility to pay the employee differential benefits. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employer argued that it did not have to pay the employee differential workers' compensation benefits, under &sect; 361 of the Worker's Disability Compensation Act (WDCA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.101 et seq., where the employer could not rehire the employee because of the employee's commission of a crime. The appellate court noted that, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 791.205a(1), the employee had been convicted of a felony, thus, the employer could not reemploy the employee. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.361(1) of the WDCA only applied to employees who were able to work in some capacity. It only addressed those situations in which the employee was employed, but earning less money than before the work-related injury. Employers had to compensate employees for a loss of wage-earning capacity that resulted from a work-related injury; but, if the difference in pay was because of imprisonment or commission of a crime, the employee was not entitled to differential benefits. The employee's lost earning capacity was caused not by a work-related injury, but the commission of a felony. The WDCA was not intended to compensate employees for committing crimes and becoming imprisoned.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2961. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit certified a question to the court regarding the imposition of double-damages under the SRCA.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The representative sold equipment for the corporation under the terms of a contract. After the representative was terminated, he sought unpaid commissions on four sales. The corporation refused to pay because it did not believe that the representative was entitled to the commissions. During the trial in federal court, the corporation sought a jury instruction regarding the mental state required for the double-damages provision contained in the SCRA. The federal trial court refused to give the instruction. On appeal, the federal appellate court certified a question to the court regarding the intent required under the SCRA. The court determined that evidence of bad faith was not required in order to recover double-damages under the SCRA. The court determined that the clear language of the SCRA did not show an intent to create a good faith defense to the double-damages provision of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2961(5). Because there was no ambiguity in &sect; 600.2961(5), the court was not permitted to examine the legislative history. The court noted that the only cognizable defense to a double-damages claim was that the failure to pay the commissions was based on inadvertence or oversight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court concluded that the plain language of the SCRA did not require evidence of bad faith before double-damages could have been imposed. The case was returned to the federal court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The drug companies were the subjects of product liability actions in the Circuit Courts of Wayne County and Washtenaw County, based on the companies' manufacture and distribution of diet drugs. In each lawsuit, the companies moved for summary judgment based on Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.2946(5), which limited the companies' liability, as the drugs at issue were approved for safety and efficacy by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and labeled in compliance with FDA standards. The Wayne County Circuit Court held that the statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The other trial court held the statute to be constitutional. The Court of Appeals agreed with the Wayne County Court and held that statute improperly granted the FDA the authority to determine when a drug manufacturer would be liable under Michigan law. The Michigan Supreme Court held that the statute did not improperly delegate legislative authority to the FDA, as the act of approving a drug as safe had significance independent of its effect on Michigan law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Supreme Court of Michigan previously granted a request by the Michigan House of Representatives for an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Metropolitan Extension Telecommunications Rights-of-Way Oversight Act (2002 PA 48). Amicus curiae briefs were filed. Motions by interest groups were pending before the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Although the supreme court invited anyone with an interest in 2002 PA 48 to file amicus curiae briefs on the questions posed by the Michigan House of Representatives, only one of the five briefs filed presented a challenge to the constitutionality of the act based upon only one of the questions at issue. Given the apparent lack of interest in the legal questions posed by the legislature concerning 2002 PA 48 and the absence of briefing sufficient to raise and flesh out potential competing arguments and contexts necessary to a reasoned opinion, the supreme court concluded that the citizens of Michigan would be better served to have any challenges to 2002 PA 48 resolved in the traditional manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The motion by the Michigan Cable Telecommunications Association for leave to file a brief amicus curiae was granted. The motion by the Michigan Municipal League and the Michigan Townships Association for oral argument was denied as moot. The supreme court vacated its earlier order and declined to issue an advisory opinion to the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a mandamus action filed by plaintiffs, the circuit court ordered that a proposition changing the current at-large system of electing the Detroit city council to a single-member district plan be placed on the ballot. The Court of Appeals (Michigan) denied the motions of the intervenors, the Detroit City Council and its incumbent members, and defendant, the Detroit Election Commission, to keep the proposition off the ballot. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Election Commission declined to certify the proposition for inclusion on the ballot. Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 29 provided that a local act could not take effect until approved by two-thirds of the members of each house and a majority of electors voting in the district affected. Although 2002 Mich. Pub. Act 432, which would amend the Home Rule City Act by adding Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 117.3a, did not refer by name to Detroit, but rather purported to apply to any city with a population of more than 750,000 that had a 9-member at-large elected city council, only Detroit met that population criterion. Thus, the statute plainly failed to qualify as a general act. Even if another city reached a population of 750,000 and had a 9-member at-large council, 2002 Mich. Pub. Act 432 would not apply because of its requirement that the proposition appear on the ballot at the August 6, 2002, election. No other city could meet that requirement, as there would be no new census before that date. Because 2002 Mich. Pub. Act 432 did not receive a two-thirds vote in each house, it did not satisfy the requirements for placing the proposition on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

Ultimately, he was denied the position, which was given to a minority whose test rating was lower than the employee's rating. The employee sued several government entities, alleging that he was improperly denied a promotion and that minority applicants with lower test scores were promoted. He brought the action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, Mich. Const. art. 11, &sect; 5, and the Michigan Civil Rights Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 37.2101 et seq.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment that personal property belonging to petitioner corporation did not constitute &quot;special tools&quot; and was therefore subject to taxation. The corporation appealed, arguing that guidelines utilized by the tax tribunal were not determinative, since they were not rules promulgated in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 24.201 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The corporation used plastic injection molds and related components. The state tax commission held that the molds were not exempt &quot;special tools&quot; within the meaning of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.9b. The supreme court held that the plain language of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.10e demonstrated a legislative intent that the state tax commissioner's assessor's manual was to be used &quot;as a guide.&quot; It could not be concluded that the legislature intended that the state tax commission was entitled to bypass the APA and promulgate the assessor's manual as a rule having the force of law. Mich. Admin. Code r. 21 established two requirements for qualification for the special tools exemption. First, the special tool had to be &quot;used&quot; or be &quot;being prepared for use&quot; in manufacturing. Second, the special tools had to be of such a specialized nature that their utility and amortization ceased with the discontinuance of such products. The assessor's manual guidelines contained a short useful life requirement, but Mich. Admin. Code r. 21 did not allow that construction. Rule 21 only addressed whether the tool would have usefulness after the product was discontinued. There was no other time condition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A constitutional amendment limiting real property tax increases was adopted, providing a property's value could be adjusted for &quot;additions,&quot; without regard to the amendment's cap. The legislature adopted Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.34d(1)(b)(vii), defining &quot;additions&quot; to include an increase in a property's value due to increased occupancy by tenants. The supreme court held that when the amendment was passed, the General Property Tax Act defined &quot;additions&quot; as increases in a property's value caused by new construction or the addition of equipment or furnishings, or the value of property exempt from or not included in a preceding year's assessment, in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.34d(1)(a), as then in effect. This did not include an increase in occupancy by tenants. The term &quot;additions&quot; in the constitutional amendment was to be given the definition understood at the time of enactment, as the amendment did not intend another meaning. The legislature could not redefine constitutional terms. The attempt, in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 211.34d(1)(b)(vii), to expand the meaning of &quot;additions,&quot; for property tax valuation purposes, was inconsistent with the constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that under a plain reading of Mich. Comp. Laws Serv. &sect; 691.1407, the first sentence of &sect; 691.1407 applied to both municipal corporations and the state, while the second sentence applied only to the state. The plain language of &sect; 691.1407 did not contain a trespass-nuisance exception to governmental immunity and trespass-nuisance simply was not one of the five exceptions to immunity set forth in &sect; 691.1407. The court overruled a prior decision that held that trespass-nuisance was a recognized exception to the governmental immunity statute. However, the effect of its rule only operated prospectively, such that the homeowners were not precluded from seeking recovery. The court also held that Mich. Pub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In support of their action, the voters claimed that redistricting plan of 2001 Mich. Pub.

The voters also contended that the plan failed to comply with statutory requirements for congressional redistricting established by 1999 Mich. Pub. Acts 221. The supreme court rejected the voters' arguments. The court concluded that 2001 PA 115 was validly enacted, as the changes made before submission to the Governor were technical corrections that did not violate the provisions of the Michigan Constitution regarding enactment of legislation. The court also held that the requirements of 1999 Mich. Pub. Acts 211 was not binding on the Legislature's redistricting of Michigan's congressional seats in 2001, and therefore the reference to the 1999 guidelines in 2001 Mich. Pub.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The appellate court found that the fact that an arrest was made by an officer outside his jurisdiction did not require exclusion of the evidence obtained as a result of the arrest or dismissal of the charge. The officer lacked the statutory authority to make the arrest under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 764.16. The officer did have probable cause to arrest the defendant based on sobriety tests and this meant that the arrest did not violate the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable seizures. Where the officer had probable cause to believe that the crime had been committed, and therefore had the constitutionally required basis to search and seize, there would appear to be no need to suppress such evidence, even though the arrest was statutorily illegal. Because Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 764.2a did not require exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of police conduct that was not in accordance with the statute, the circuit court erred in suppressing the evidence and dismissing the charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The bases for the Judicial Tenure Commission's (JTC's) complaint concerned two aspects of the judge's conduct.

The judge also made false statements to police officers investigating the murder of the attorney's wife. On review, the state supreme court affirmed the JTC's findings, and concluded that the JTC's recommendation of a one-year suspension of respondent was a reasonable one. Pursuant to Mich. Ct. R. 9.225, the court modified the recommendation of the JTC to require a six-month suspension without pay, in order to accord the judge partial credit for the 17-month interim suspension with pay that she had already served.</SPAN></P>

He filed a motion for relief from judgment under Mich. Ct. R. 6.500. Relief was denied by the circuit court, and the court of appeals denied leave to appeal. The matter was put before the state supreme court. In addition to arguing the substantive issues, defendant maintained that limitations on relief provided by Mich. Ct. R. 6.508(D) were inapplicable because his conviction predated the effective date of the rule. The state supreme court disagreed. Application of Rule 6.508(D) did not bar the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws. Further, Rule 6.508(D)(3) procedure was not a firmly established and regularly followed rule of the Michigan courts at the time of defendant's conviction. Thus, it did not constitute an adequate and independent state ground barring review of defendant's habeas petition in federal court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Reverse the Court of Appeals in part, vacate the preliminary injunction entered by the circuit court in its entirety, and remand case to circuit court for any appropriate proceedings.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant, the Michigan Civil Service Commission, adopted amended Mich. Civ. Serv. R. 406. The Ingham Circuit Court, Michigan, granted a preliminary injunction to plaintiffs (unions) to prohibit the commission from implementing the amended rule. The court of appeals granted the commission's application for leave to appeal from the issuance of the preliminary injunction, and affirmed in part and reversed in part. The commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the Supreme Court of Michigan considered the question whether a party alleging a violation of Mich. Const. art 11, &sect; 5, the provision of the Michigan Constitution related to the state civil service system, must make a particularized showing of irreparable harm to obtain a preliminary injunction against the alleged violation. The supreme court concluded that the lower courts erred in viewing a particularized showing of irreparable harm as unnecessary to obtaining a preliminary injunction against an alleged violation of Mich. Const. art 11, &sect; 5. The supreme court read nothing in &sect; 5 that would suggest that, in the civil service realm, the actions of the government were any more susceptible to preliminary injunctive relief than were the actions of any other private or public entity. Pending the resolution of a suit claiming a violation of &sect; 5, a party to such a suit could obtain a preliminary injunction only after satisfying all the requirements traditionally required for this extraordinary relief. Thus, the circuit court abused its discretion by granting a preliminary injunction in the present case in the absence of such a showing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decision of the court of appeals was reversed in part, the preliminary injunction entered by the circuit court was vacated in its entirety, and the case was remanded to the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The obstructing charge was based on defendant's lying to the police about his identity after he was arrested. The court of appeals based its holding on People v.

The Supreme Court of Michigan reversed, finding that the legislature had demonstrated in &sect; 750.479 a purpose of proscribing only conduct amounting to actual or threatened physical interference. The principal purpose of statute was to protect officers from physical harm. Defendant's lie to the police officer about his name and age, while certainly not laudatory, did not physically interfere with or threaten to physically interfere with the officer.</SPAN></P>

He applied for a firefighter position six consecutive years, and each time he was denied employment. The applicant believed that the city wrongfully refused to hire him because he was white. On appeal, the applicant challenged the use of an affirmative action plan in hiring decisions. The supreme court held that Mich. Comp.

The decisions of circuit court and the court of appeals dismissing the CRA claims were affirmed.

The supreme court held: (1) the retrial for second-degree murder was permissible and did not violate the constitutional protection against successive prosecutions; (2) the retrial of defendant resulted in multiple punishments for the same offense; (3) the constitutional violation should have been remedied by affirming the involuntary manslaughter conviction and vacating defendant's conviction of negligent homicide; and (4) Mich.

Pub. Acts 349, which excluded certain payments from the companies' burdens for retaliatory tax calculations, converted the retaliatory tax from a tax intended to discourage other states from imposing excessive levels of taxation on in-state insurers to a tax designed to raise revenue at the expense of foreign insurers. The supreme court held that neither Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.476a, nor 1988 Mich. Pub.

The supreme court also affirmed. The court agreed with appellant that there was no indication in Mich. Comp.

However, the court declined to adopt an alternative defense to legal insanity that could swallow up the insanity defense and its attendant commitment provisions. By enacting a comprehensive statutory scheme setting forth the requirements for and the effects of asserting a defense based on either mental illness or mental retardation, the legislature had signified its intent not to allow a defendant to introduce evidence of mental abnormalities short of legal insanity to avoid or reduce criminal responsibility by negating specific intent.</SPAN></P>

The commission argued that the respondent, at the time of the campaign, was aware of the obligations imposed by the canon and was accountable for the contents of his campaign literature and that four of the respondent's campaign communications revealed a conscious effort by the respondent to use false statements and to use them with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity as part and parcel of his campaign strategy. The commission concluded that respondent's conduct constituted misconduct in office, clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice. The court disagreed with the commission and concluded that the public communications were not false, and rejected the commission's recommendation of suspension. The respondent did not violate the canon, as the court's review of the exhibits revealed that the communications were either literally true, substantially true despite their inaccuracies, or communicated mere rhetorical hyperbole.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 229.1 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.281 et seq.). The Keweenaw Circuit Court (Michigan) denied both requests. The court of appeals reversed as to the private roads act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiffs were a developer and the owners of lots purchased from that developer. Plaintiff developer's entire parcel was landlocked. Plaintiff sought a road and an easement for utility lines across defendants' neighboring parcel. Defendants refused, resulting in plaintiffs' legal action. The private roads act, dating back to 1850, allowed a private landowner to petition the town supervisor to open a private road across another landowner's property. The court of appeals ordered the writ that would have required the supervisor to initiate a proceeding under the act. The supreme court reversed, holding that the act authorized a taking, as it allowed a permanent physical occupation of private property by means of government action. The taking primarily benefitted only a private rather than a public purpose, and the act required the party petitioning for the road, rather than the state, to compensate the landowner. The court therefore struck down the act as unconstitutional, in violation of both U.S. Const. amend. V and Mich. Const. art 10, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a possession of a firearm by a felon case, the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed a trial court's order suppressing the firearms and dismissing the case. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The issue in this case was whether firearms found in defendant's home, upon execution by federal and state law enforcement officers of a federal search warrant, were properly excluded from evidence in a state prosecution. Defendant argued that Michigan statutory provisions required the officers executing the warrant to provide her with a copy of the affidavit in support of the warrant. Because the officers provided only the warrant itself and not the affidavit, defendant claimed that the search was defective and that the firearms found had to be suppressed. The State argued that, because the only defect in the search and seizure was a technical violation of Michigan's statutory warrant requirements, and because there had been no violation of defendant's constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment, the exclusionary rule should not have been applied. The instant court held that the lower courts erred in applying the exclusionary rule as a remedy for this statutory violation. The instant court was unable to conclude that the legislature intended the exclusionary rule to apply to a procedural violation of Michigan's statutory warrant requirements at issue in this case.</SPAN></P>

As legislative intent was the test for determining whether a governmental unit was immune from the provisions of local zoning ordinances, the supreme court determined that the clear import of the legislature's enactment of 1996 Mich. Pub. Acts 538, which by its terms granted the state police responsibility for all matters concerning construction of the Michigan Public Safety Communications System (MPSCS), was to exempt the state police from local zoning ordinances so that the MPSCS could effectively and efficiently be constructed. Further, the supreme court found that the MPSCS project was not subject to local zoning ordinances or use permits issued under those ordinances, except as specifically provided in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 28.282(2) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4.492(2)). Thus, the court held that the site of the tower was selected in a manner that accorded with the pertinent statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed from a conflict panel of the Court of Appeals, Michigan, holding that a repealed section of a paternity statute was unconstitutional as a violation of the equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff was denied modification of a child support agreement because it was written as unmodifiable pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.713 (repealed 1997). Constitutionality of the law was challenged as a violation of the Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2. The statute provided for situations under which illegitimate children received the same right to fully modifiable support as children born during a marriage, so it did not create a classification on the basis of illegitimacy. The statute would be upheld as long as it was rationally related to a permissible legislative objective. It was designed to address paternity proof problems in the support context, which was an important governmental interest. It afforded enhanced opportunities for support of illegitimate children. Because the statute was substantially and directly related to obtaining child support for illegitimate children, and because it was substantially and directly related to the state's legitimate concern regarding proof problems in the child support context, it was not an unconstitutional denial of equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment holding a paternity statute provision unconstitutional was reversed because the provision was substantially and directly related to obtaining support for illegitimate children and to the state's legitimate concern regarding proof problems in the child support context. The provision, therefore, did not violate the constitutional guarantees of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court consolidated two Courts of Appeals' (Michigan) decisions which were in conflict. One had reversed a trial court's summary disposition for defendants, police officers and city, and the other had affirmed summary disposition for defendants, officers and city, both in plaintiffs', passengers and personal representative, negligence suits for injury and death resulting from the crash of a vehicle which had fled pursuing police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court consolidated two cases. One case held that police owed passengers in a fleeing car a duty of reasonable care, officers were not immune from liability under the employee provision of the governmental immunity act, and, that because of the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity, the city was not immune. The other case, a few minutes after the above decision was released, held that police owed no duty to a voluntary passenger in a fleeing car. The court reversed the first and affirmed the second. Where police cars did not hit the fleeing car or physically cause something to hit it, or physically force it off the road or into something, plaintiffs', passengers, injuries did not, as a matter of law, result from the operation of the police cars. Thus the court overruled Fiser v. Ann Arbor, 417 Mich. 461; 339 N.W. 2d 413 (1983), and Rogers v. Detroit, 457 Mich. 125; 579 N.W. 2d 840 (1998). Individual officers were immune from liability where their actions were not &quot;the&quot; proximate cause of the plaintiffs' injuries. Thus the court also overruled Dedes v Asch, 446 Mich. 99; 521 N.W. 2d 488 (1994). Police decision to pursue was also not negligent vehicle operation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Reversal of summary disposition by the first appellate court was reversed, affirmation of summary disposition by the second appellate court was affirmed. The court overruled three cases and held that police cars did not, as a matter of law, cause fleeing cars' passengers' injuries where they did not hit, or cause to be hit, the fleeing car; and individual officers were immune from liability if not &quot;the&quot; proximate cause of plaintiffs' injuries.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated the appellate court's decision remanding denial of appointment of appellate counsel to the trial court, holding that neither the state nor the federal constitution required the appointment of counsel under those circumstances. Under the state constitution, the mechanism of appellate review was discretionary. Thus, defendant was not entitled to appointed appellate counsel under either the state or federal constitution. Defendant was not entitled to the appointment of appellate counsel under Mich. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 because such assistance was not &quot;provided by law&quot; when defendant requested counsel. Moreover, the federal constitution did not mandate appointment of counsel under the present circumstances because defendant had not been denied meaningful access to Michigan's appellate courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Canon 7(B)(1)(d) is facially unconstitutional. Canon to apply only to public communications that the candidate for judicial office knew were false or were used by the candidate with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. The determination whether a candidate recklessly disregarded the truth or falsity of a public communication involves an objective inquiry.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent, a judge, petitioned the court to reject the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission's recommendation of suspension for 90 days for misconduct arising out of respondent's judicial campaign literature, which allegedly violated Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 7(B)(1)(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Respondent judge challenged the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission's (JTC) recommendation of his 90-day suspension for disseminating campaign literature that allegedly violated Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 7(B)(1)(d), arguing the canon violated U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that Canon 7(B)(1)(d) was facially unconstitutional and narrowed it to prohibit a candidate from knowingly or recklessly using false public communications. The court remanded for a determination whether respondent violated the narrowed canon, and if so, for a new disciplinary recommendation. Canon 7(B)(1)(d) was not narrowly tailored to serve the state's compelling interest in maintaining election process integrity and ensuring public confidence in the judiciary. Canon 7(B)(1)(d) authorized disciplinary action for core political speech by broadly regulating all forms of public communication, creating a realistic danger of a chilling effect. The determination as to respondent's knowledge was to involve an objective inquiry, not an actual malice standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judicial cannon was facially unconstitutional; the court remanded for a determination in light of the court's narrowing of the cannon of whether respondent's knew his public communications were false or were used with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity, a determination that was to involve an objective inquiry.</SPAN></P>
