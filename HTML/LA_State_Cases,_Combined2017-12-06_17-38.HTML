<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-The district court abused its discretion in enjoining the State from enforcing its order suspending alcohol permits at an owner's stores because the injunction went farther than preserving the status quo and improperly enjoined the Office of Alcohol and Tobacco Control (ATC) from performing its duty to regulate and control the sale of alcoholic beverages in order to protect the public interest and ensure the safety of citizens; [2]-The board language of the injunction not only limited the ATC in pursuing its investigation related to a manager's suitability under the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:80(A)(5), it rendered the ATC powerless to take any action against the owner's permits; [3]-The owner failed to establish that he would suffer irreparable injury because the loss of alcohol sales was readily susceptible to quantification in money damages.</SPAN></P>

Code Evid. art. 506 by receiving testimony from defendant's attorney because the attorney was not questioned about, nor did she reveal, any confidential communications; the State's line of questioning the attorney concerned whether she was told that for a sum of money paid to defendant a video and charges against her would go away; thus, defendant's attorney-client privilege was not impacted.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 561 to not guilty by reason of insanity a few days prior to trial because both psychiatrists opined that defendant's mental illness did not cause him to commit the offense, and defendant's delay in filing the motion increased his burden of proving good cause.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:863.1(C)(1)(a), the officer had no duty to let a third party retrieve the car, instead of towing, as the officer had authority to have the car towed, nothing showed he knew the car was insured, the car's passengers had no valid licenses, the car was parked dangerously close to the fog-line, and the third party did not own the car, so the officer reasonably had it towed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2157(A)(1)(b), did not waive his right to annul the sale; [2]-No fact issue existed as to whether a city reasonably tried to notify him because, when his mailed notices were returned unclaimed, the city did not take further reasonable required steps, as the city's contractor's affidavit stating normal steps taken to give notice did not state they were used, notifying a mortgagee would have caused it to provide his current address, and no notice was sent to an address in his publicly recorded original act of sale.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 14:95(E) because defendant was living at the apartment at the time the search warrant was executed; the jury was presented with evidence of the confession defendant gave to police on the day of his arrest, during which he professed ownership of the guns and all of the drugs found in the apartment; and a nexus was established between the marijuana and the guns found as guns and drugs frequently went hand-in-hand.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 14:30.1 for a crime committed when appellant, a juvenile, was a juvenile was not excessive for not stating reasons therefor because not stating every circumstance in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 did not require resentencing, as there was an adequate factual basis, Miller required no articulation of all mitigating factors, and no exceptional case requiring a downward departure from the mandatory minimum sentence was shown; [2]-Claims that his sentence was an ex post facto application of Miller, causing lack of fair notice, failed because Miller was found applicable; [3]-He was not entitled to resentencing for manslaughter, due to the unconstitutionality of the statute under which he was first sentenced, because he received the required remedy of a hearing to consider his youth and circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. VII, &sect; 25(C) said interest ran solely on the price and taxes paid, and the method for calculating a difference between the award and the sum of two affidavits caused compound interest and 10% interest on costs, contrary to La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 25(C); [2]-The affidavit was also insufficient because it sought compensation for a nonparty and did not state how interest was calculated, despite La. Const. art.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1:2 required that it be given prospective application only; [3]-Application of the Act to the doctor's fraudulent conduct, which occurred before the effective date of the Act, was an impermissible retroactive application of the law because it evaluated the conditions of his liability for past conduct.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 495.1 because the facts of each offense were distinct, simple, and uncomplicated, and there was no indication that the State's presenting evidence of the crimes together confused the jury; [3]-Other crimes evidence was properly admitted under La.

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 841A; [3]-Defendant failed to demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his counsel's performance during the trial under U.S. Const. amend.

HOLDINGS: [1]-Conditioning the biological father's visitation with the child on the payment of his child support arrearage each month was void as against public policy in the case because, pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1759 and 1983, the parties were obligated to act in good faith. However, the trial court accepted the biological father's testimony that he was never allowed to exercise visitation according to the agreement because the mother would not allow the visitation and found that the mother did not act in good faith under the agreement; [2]-The mother's and the adoptive father's unilateral termination of visitation compounded the unfairness of the mother's failure to perform in good faith.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 521 and was untimely; [3]-It was error to base the decision on the motion to quash on evidence, not offered in this case, but presented in another case heard by the same trial judge; [4]-A contradictory hearing was not held under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 537 as the State attempted to speak during the hearing on the motion to quash, but was not allowed to present any argument on the merits.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 14:95.1 in the lower court, the issue was not reviewable; [3]-The trial court erroneously used defendant's three instant convictions of illegal possession of stolen firearms as predicates to enhance his sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon since the felony being enhanced was not committed after defendant's convictions of the predicate offenses and was, therefore, a violation of the sequencing procedure set forth in La.

Code Evid. art. 404B because it was admissible to show absence of mistake; that conclusion was logical and relevant, especially considering defendant's contention that the apartment was not his and that he had no connection to it, and the implication that evidence seized in the apartment pursuant the warrant could have belonged to a third party.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 851(3); [3]-Even assuming the State knew of witnesses' arrests prior to trial and failed to furnish that information to defendant, the State's failure to divulge the information did not undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial or deny defendant his right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 20 because defendant had a prior conviction for felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile, he was on probation before, and the dependence of defendant's children on him was a mitigating factor; [3]-Because the record did not establish which conduct supported which conviction and because the legality and excessiveness of at least one of the two sexual battery convictions could not be determined, the sentences were vacated.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:64, 14:64.3, which arose from his involvement in a string of robberies that culminated in the murder of a store clerk, was not excessive because it was on the lower end of the penalty range for the crime, he had avoided the possibility of what could have been for all practical purposes a lifetime in prison by pleading guilty, and his participation in the robberies was not minor.</SPAN></P>

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 802 because the victim's wounds did not indicate that defendant acted in self-defense, and defendant's failure to report the shooting, his disposal of the gun and car, and his flight were also inconsistent with self-defense; [3]-Constitutional violations in defendant's first trial caused by a witness's misleading testimony were remedied by the reversal of defendant's conviction and the granting of a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 799.1, the defense suffered no prejudice from the error because the veniremember was not seated as a juror; [3]-The court erred by holding a hearing to &quot;clarify&quot; the verdict and then changing it; [4]-Taking into account the number of gunshots fired and the serious injury which might have been inflicted, the court properly sentenced defendant to eighteen years for attempted armed robbery under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:27.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-There was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty of aggravated battery for shooting a deputy because the deputy testified that he saw defendant reach his hand to the trigger and point the gun as the deputy charged and tasered him; the fact that the bullet, shot at close range, only grazed the deputy's arm did not prove that it was an accidental shooting; [2]-On a charge of attempted incest, the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant specifically intended to engage in sexual intercourse with his mother because she testified that he tried to place his finger inside her vagina, ripped her pajamas off, and attempted to push her down on the bed; [3]-Defendant's maximum or near-maximus sentences constituted a needless infliction of pain and suffering, in violation of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, because of defendant's diminished mental capacity and mental illness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">HOLDINGS: [1]-Following defendant's convictions for incest with his daughters, his motion for new trial based on one daughter's recanting of her testimony was properly denied because the record suggested that the daughter fabricated her recanting testimony after defendant received a severe sentence, and her original testimony had been corroborated by others; [2]-Although La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42(A)(4) had been amended to change the age at which the crime became aggravated from under 12 to under 13, the victim was 11 at the time of the crimes, and defendant could still be prosecuted; [3]-The trial court erred in several of the sentences it imposed by amending legal sentences after execution when it was divested of the authority to amend under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881; however, it had authority to correct illegal sentences under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 882.</SPAN></P>
