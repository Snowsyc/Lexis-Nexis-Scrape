</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">ISSUE: Whether defendant was entitled to relief from his sentence of death. HOLDINGS: [1]-Hurst was not to be applied retroactively to defendant's case, in which the death sentence became final before the issuance of Ring. Therefore, the fact that the trial judge, rather than the jury, made certain findings to make defendant eligible for a sentence of death did not bar the sentence under U.S. Const. amend. VI; [2]-The summary denial of defendant's motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 was appropriate because a sworn affidavit of a ballistics expert did not constitute newly discovered evidence, defendant failed to show deficiency or prejudice in the assistance of counsel, and allegedly withheld evidence was not material such that its alleged suppression prejudiced defendant; [3]-Defendant's claims of due process and equal protection violations failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary denial of defendant's motion for postconviction relief affirmed. Defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus denied.</SPAN></P>

Because trial counsel was directly informed of mental health problems and possible organic brain damage with a written report from the expert counsel hired, the lack of investigation was not reasonable.</SPAN></P>

VI, &sect; 5(b), Fla. Const., because, while all candidates had the same party affiliation, one was a write-in candidate, so a requirement of no opposition in the general election to the candidate selected by the primary, to open the primary to all voters, was not met, since the write-in candidate's failure to live in a district at the time of qualification was not dispositive, as &sect; 99.0615, Fla.

Stat., was unconstitutional as applied to calculate attorney's fees for the hours incurred in defending against the excessive litigation. HOLDINGS: [1]-When a condemnor's tactics caused excessive litigation, the trial court had to use &sect; 73.092(2) to calculate reasonable fees for the time incurred in defending against the excessive litigation; the rest of the fee had to be calculated under &sect; 73.092(1)'s benefits achieved formula; [2]-The condemnees had not been required to seek bad faith sanctions to secure attorney's fees above the statutory award, as an award of attorney's fees as a sanction for bad faith was a punitive concept distinct from their right under to full compensation under art. X, &sect; 6(a), Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>

The case was indistinguishable from other cases involving the single aggravator of a murder during the commission of a robbery where the supreme court had vacated the death penalty. Accordingly, the case was remanded for the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The pecuniary gain aggravator must merge with the murder in the course of a felony aggravator when the latter was based on a robbery conviction. Accordingly, there was only a single aggravator in the case.</SPAN></P>

The statutory cap on wrongful death noneconomic damages failed because it imposed unfair and illogical burdens on injured parties when an act of medical negligence gave rise to multiple claimants. In such circumstances, medical malpractice claimants did not receive the same rights to full compensation because of arbitrarily diminished compensation for legally cognizable claims.

(2006), when the contracts were entered; [2]-The lower court did not properly interpret the escrow requirements of &sect; 718.202 and the trial court properly dismissed the claims against the developer; [3]-Because the text of the statute was ambiguous, the rule of lenity under &sect; 775.021(1), Fla. Stat. (2013), was applied, and it required that the statute be construed most favorably to the developer; [4]-Thus, the maintenance of deposits required by both &sect; 718.202(1) and (2) in a single escrow account was authorized.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first rejected the legislature's argument that it should issue a writ of prohibition because it had exclusive jurisdiction over legislative reapportionment under Art. III, &sect; 16, Fla. Const. The court had never considered its jurisdiction over challenges to a plan to be exclusive and limited to the constitutionally mandated 30-day review. Instead, the court had always conducted a facial review of the validity of a  plan and had consistently contemplated the possibility of subsequent fact-based challenges to the plan. As for all writs jurisdiction, the proper interpretation of the declaratory judgment language in Article III, &sect; 16(c)-(d) was that the declaratory judgment rendered pursuant to that provision was binding as to the facial validity of the plan, but not to subsequent fact-based challenges. With regard to the legislature's second all-writs argument, at this stage of the litigation, the legislature's assertion that the complaint presented claims identical to those already decided did not provide a basis for the court to grant relief through an extraordinary writ. Whether the claims would amount to &quot;a rehash of facial arguments made before&quot; remained to be seen.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the legislature's petition for extraordinary relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent homeowners association (HOA) sued petitioner home builder for breach of the implied warranties of fitness and merchantability. The builder filed a third-party complaint against petitioner contractor for indemnification. The trial court granted petitioners summary judgment; the HOA appealed. The Fifth District Court of Appeal (Florida) reversed and certified conflict with the Fourth District. Petitioners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The HOA alleged that storm water failed to drain, flooding its members' driveways. The trial court held that implied warranties of fitness and merchantability did not extend to common areas in a residential subdivision as those structures did not immediately support the residences. The intermediate appellate court reversed, finding that the common law warranty of habitability applied. The legislature then enacted &sect; 553.835, Fla. Stat. (2012), which rejected that decision. The high court held that the implied warranties of fitness and merchantability applied to improvements that provided essential services to the habitability of a residence. It disapproved of Port Sewall Harbor &amp; Tennis Club Owners Association, Inc. v. First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Martin County, 463 So. 2d 530 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985), to the extent it held otherwise. As &sect; 553.835 was substantive, not remedial, it could not be constitutionally applied retroactively to divest the HOA of its cause of action, a vested right. Section 553.835 was unconstitutional because it violated the right of access to courts set out in art. I, &sect; 21, Fla. Const., and the separation of powers principle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The high court approved the decision of the intermediate appellate court and disapproved the Fourth District's decision to the extent that it was inconsistent with the high court's opinion. It remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The inmate had been previously convicted of the first-degree premeditated murder of his two stepdaughters, and he was sentenced to death for each murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued with his wife. After she left for work, he fatally shot both of her daughters. As he attempted to flee to Mexico, he was stopped by police. During an interview in Texas, defendant confessed to the murders. He was initially found incompetent to stand trial. Upon determining that he was competent two years later, a trial was held. He was convicted and sentenced to death, which decision was affirmed on appeal. After his continued refusal to sign the required verification of the PCR motion, it was dismissed. On appeal, the court found that as the inmate was twice found competent to proceed, Rule 3.851(g)(1) and (2) did not require the trial court to proceed. Further, Rule 3.851(i)(1) was not applicable, as the inmate did not wish to dismiss his PCR motion. He was properly found competent to proceed with his PCR proceedings, based on testimony from three experts and the trial court's own observations and interactions with the inmate pursuant to &sect; 916.12(1), Fla. Stat. (2010) and Rule 3.851(g)(8)(A). Edwards was not applicable, and a proper Farretta hearing was held, whereupon it was determined that the inmate knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Duval County (Florida), which convicted him of first-degree murder of an 82-year-old victim and imposed a sentence of death. He had also been convicted of burglary, grand theft of an automobile, dealing in stolen property, and false verification of ownership on a pawn broker transaction form.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The elderly victim's home was ransacked and her body was found on the bedroom floor. It was determined that she died from blunt head trauma due to multiple strikes with a hammer. Upon connecting defendant to the murder, a search warrant was executed at his residence, whereupon numerous items belonging to the victim were found. Defendant was convicted of murder and related offenses after a jury trial, and he was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court found sufficient evidence supported the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravator, as defensive wounds to the victim's hand and arm clearly demonstrated that she was conscious and aware of her impending death. The death sentence was not disproportionate, based on the great weight given to the two aggravating factors and the lack of any statutory mitigating factors. Comments made by the prosecutor during the penalty-phase closing argument were proper, and preclusion of defense counsel's arguments to the jury was also appropriate. A constitutionality challenge to the death penalty statute under Ring lacked merit. Under Fla. R. App. P. 9.142(a)(5), the court found sufficient evidence supported the first-degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Where appellant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death, the post-conviction court did not err in denying his motion for DNA testing of the hairs found on the murder weapon pursuant to Fla.

The court did not err by denying appellant's motion to disqualify the postconviction judge, as the motion was legally insufficient and untimely. Appellant's assertion that he had found a new witness who would have presented additional testimony concerning the extent of his military injury and a description of how the chronic pain from the injury resulted in substance abuse, was completely lacking in merit as a newly discovered evidence claim because there was no probability that this evidence would have resulted in a life sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner public defender filed motions to be relieved of the obligation to represent indigent defendants in non-capital felony cases. The trial court permitted the public defender to decline appointments in future third-degree felony cases. Respondent State appealed. The Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) reversed, concluding that excessive caseloads did not constitute a conflict of interest under &sect; 27.5303, Fla. Stat. (2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the public defender demonstrated cause for withdrawal pursuant to &sect; 27.5303. The circumstances involved some measure of non-representation and, therefore, a denial of the actual assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Witnesses from the public defender's office described &quot;meet and greet pleas&quot; as being routine procedure. The public defenders served as mere conduits for plea offers. The prejudice required for withdrawal under &sect; 27.5303 when it was based on an excessive caseload was a showing of a substantial risk that the representation of one or more clients would be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client, R. Regulating Fla. Bar 4-1.7(a)(2). Excessive caseload in the public defender's office created a problem regarding effective representation. Section 27.5303(1)(d) was facially constitutional. However, the statute could not be applied to preclude a public defender from filing a motion to withdraw based on excessive caseload or under-funding that would result in ineffective representation of indigent defendants nor to preclude a trial court from granting a motion to withdraw under those circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court quashed the third district's decision and remanded the matter to the trial court for a determination of whether the circumstances still warranted granting the public defender's motion to decline appointments in future third-degree felony cases under the standards approved in the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents sought review of an agency judgment which awarded them $ 100,000 jointly, in parental compensation, pursuant to &sect; 766.31(1)(b)1., Fla. Stat. (2007) under the Florida Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Plan (Plan). The Court of Appeal of Florida, Fifth District, upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 766.31(1)(b)1, affirmed, and certified a question. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question asked whether the limitation in &sect; 766.31(1)(b)1 of a single award of $ 100,000 to both parents violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States and Florida Constitutions. The appellate court found initially that the language of the statute could not have reasonably been interpreted to provide multiple awards of $ 100,000 to each parent. The provision did not violate equal protection. Limiting the award to $ 100,000 per claim-as opposed to per parent-was rationally related to maintaining the actuarial soundness of the Plan. Any additional payment would undeniably have had a negative effect on the Plan's actuarial soundness. The actuarial soundness of state programs was a legitimate state interest. The parental award provision did not penalize the exercise of any constitutional right or discriminate against a class of needy persons. The parental award provision was not unconstitutionally vague. The parental award provision provided a reasonable alternative remedy to the right to access the courts for redress of their injury, so there was no Art. I, &sect; 21, Fla. Const. violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The certified question was answered in the negative and the judgment of the intermediate appellate court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his trial counsel erred by not ensuring that he received a full neuropsychological examination, which would have revealed that defendant suffered from brain damage and would have led to a life sentence.

Moreover, defendant failed to prove prejudice as there was no additional competent evidence on which the jury could find &quot;extreme&quot; mental or emotional disturbance or any other mitigating factor. Further, counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the competency of the child witnesses given that this decision was a strategic decision and was entitled to deference. Defendant had not demonstrated that counsel's inquiry into the children's competency was so inadequate that a reasonably competent attorney should have objected as the children correctly reported information about themselves and their family, and the children each testified that they understood that it would be wrong to lie while on the stand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee utility companies filed petitions with the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) seeking to recover through customer rates the preconstruction costs of their respective new nuclear power plant projects under &sect; 366.93, Florida Statutes (2010). Appellant organization opposed the petitions. The PSC granted the petitions. The alliance appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization argued that &sect; 366.93&nbsp;unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority to the PSC. However, the appellate court found that establishing the subject alternative cost recovery mechanisms was simply not a &quot;fundamental legislative task,&quot; and that, accordingly, there was no separation of powers violation. The PSC's construction of &sect; 366.93 was not clearly erroneous. Section 366.93 did not require a &quot;final decision&quot; to build proposed new reactors and the preconstruction costs at issue were recoverable under &sect; 366.93. The operative statutes supported the PSC's conclusion that utilities did not need to engage in siting, design, licensing, and construction simultaneously in order to satisfy &sect; 366.93 and, by extension, that preconstruction activities creating an option to build could have demonstrated a utility's intent to build for cost recovery purposes under the statute. Substantial evidence supported the PSC's findings to the effect that the utility companies engaged in preconstruction activities creating an option to build the nuclear plants at issue. The PSC's order was not arbitrary and was supported by competent, substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted appellant inmate of first-degree murder and recommended the death penalty. The Circuit Court in and for Duval County (Florida), sentenced the inmate to death. The inmate then filed a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 postconviction relief motion against appellee State, seeking to vacate the judgment of conviction and his death sentence. The trial court denied the inmate's motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment in several specific ways. The appellate court found that the inmate's claim that his counsel failed to present certain alibi witnesses failed because he was unable to show that he was prejudiced by that failure. The testimony of two witnesses would not have actually discredited that of defendant's girlfriend, who claimed that defendant had confessed to her that he had committed the underlying robbery and murder. The inmate was unable to satisfy the Strickland prejudice prong. Further, even if these witnesses had testified, this would not have changed the fact that the girlfriend was able to recount specific facts about the robbery that were not public knowledge. Additionally, powerful evidence independent of girlfriend's testimony was introduced during trial to establish that the inmate was the perpetrator of the robbery and murder. Defense counsel offered a reasonable explanation with regard to why he did not present a third individual as a witness, and the inmate was unable to show prejudice as this person's testimony would not have contradicted that of the girlfriend.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Art. V, &sect; 3(b)(1), the Court conducted its automatic review of the two judgments of conviction of first-degree murder from the Circuit Court in and for Pinellas County (Florida), and the two sentence of death imposed against defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and sentences arose from the double homicide of a couple from whom defendant stole a safe. The Court declined to address defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claims in its direct appeal as it did not find ineffectiveness on the face of the record. The Court also rejected defendant's challenge to the seven-to-five jury vote on the death sentences, noting that it has upheld the constitutionality of such jury recommendations. Pursuant to a fundamental error standard of review, the Court held that defendant did not demonstrate that the trial court improperly suggested that the State pursue an aggravating factor that it had not previously listed in its notice based on the contemporaneous murder of the second victim because the defense received an amended notice of aggravating circumstances before trial. Further, the State first had to prove that defendant murdered both victims, therefore, the basis of the aggravating circumstance in question was his guilt or innocence of first-degree murder. The Court also found sufficient evidence to support defendant's convictions based on discussing his plan and the DNA evidence linking him to the scene of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court affirmed the trial court's judgments of conviction and sentences.</SPAN></P>

The Graves Amendment, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106 (2006), preempted &sect; 324.021(9)(b)(1). Section 324.021(9)(b)(2) clearly preserved the existing Florida law imposing vicarious liability on short-term lessors, whereas the Graves Amendment clearly sought to eliminate vicarious liability for lessors. Section 324.021(9)(b)(1), Fla. Stat. was not a financial responsibility law within the savings clause of the Graves Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2005). The trial court denied the former inmate's motion to dismiss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intermediate appellate court certified a question asking if the State had jurisdiction to initiate civil commitment proceedings under the Act against an inmate who was entitled to immediate release based on a corrected award of gain time. The appellate court answered this question in the negative. The former inmate's sentence was 5.5 years in prison, but a postconviction court later granted his motion to correct sentence and ordered that he be awarded additional prison credit. The Act applied to only individuals in &quot;lawful custody,&quot; not merely individuals in actual custody. Lawful custody under &sect; 394.9135(1), Fla. Stat. (2005) required the State to initiate commitment proceedings before the expiration of sentence date. The State's interest had to be balanced against the constitutional guarantee of due process of law, and, thus, the Act required lawful custody. The former inmate was not in lawful custody at the time commitment proceedings were initiated on December 6, 2005, because his sentence expired on August 31, 2005, based on the postconviction court's determination of entitlement to two years of credit against his sentence of 5.5 years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the circuit court erred in summarily denying his claim that the Florida death penalty statute, which allowed a non-unanimous verdict, was unconstitutional. The supreme court held that non-unanimous jury recommendations to impose the sentence of death were not unconstitutional. Because appellant raised purely legal claims that had been previously rejected by the supreme court, the circuit court properly summarily denied relief under Rule 3.851(d)(2) on his claim. Because the records appellant request were not relevant to a colorable claim, the circuit court properly denied the requests. The underlying claim for which the records were sought was that the Governor's selection of appellant for a death warrant was somehow tainted by public input. However, appellant's claim regarding the Governor's discretion was without merit. Accordingly, even if the records could have helped appellant to accurately support his allegation, the claim was not cognizable. Because the record demonstrated that appellant's counsel did present evidence in mitigation, appellant's claim that counsel failed to present mitigation at the resentencing trial was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant appointed registry counsel (counsel) brought a motion for reimbursement against appellee chief financial officer, requesting, among other things, an order directing the payment of his investigative fees including an additional $ 1,844 in fees which exceeded the &sect; 27.711(5), Fla. Stat. (2011) statutory cap for investigative expenses. The Circuit Court in and for Duval County (Florida) denied the motion. Counsel appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Counsel sought reimbursement of investigative fees in a capital postconviction proceeding. The appellate court found that, in denying the motion, the trial court improperly focused on whether this was an &quot;ordinary&quot; capital case, as opposed to reviewing whether there were &quot;extraordinary or unusual circumstances&quot; that required counsel to exceed the statutory cap for investigative expenses. Counsel's actions and the expenses incurred were reasonable and necessary and the case presented &quot;extraordinary or unusual circumstances&quot; that required counsel to exceed the cap. The expenses at issue were related to finding numerous witnesses who provided similar statements that shortly after the codefendants were arrested, they admitted that they were responsible for the murder but blamed the crime on defendant. Among other things, the investigator had to conduct substantial investigation to discover the evidence at issue. Counsel asserted that he did not exhaust the statutory fees to which he would have been entitled and that he could have performed the investigatory services himself. The considerations were considered unusual circumstances and justified exceeding the statutory cap.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial in the Volusia County Circuit Court (Florida), defendant was convicted of the first-degree murder of a male victim, the manslaughter of a female victim, and burglary while armed. The trial court followed the jury's recommendation and  sentenced defendant to death. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims had been fatally stabbed. Police found defendant hiding in a friend's home, and found the male victim's wallet there, in a bag along with defendant's bloody shirt. Defendant told detectives that the man had killed the woman and attacked defendant, and that defendant had killed the man in self-defense. The high court held that defendant's conviction of premeditated, first-degree murder of the male victim was supported by sufficient evidence, including 1) eyewitness testimony that defendant was the aggressor and repeatedly stabbed the victim as he tried to flee; 2) the friend's testimony that defendant told her on the night of the crimes that he had &quot;eliminated a couple of problems&quot;; 3) evidence that blood swabbed from defendant's fingers matched the victim's; 4) testimony that the victim had been stabbed 24 times and had defensive wounds on his forearms. The death sentence was proportional in relation to other death sentences that had been upheld, as the trial court properly found that the aggravators--including defendant's two prior violent felony convictions and the heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner of the crime--far outweighed the mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate was convicted of first-degree murder. The inmate brought a successive motion for postconviction relief (PCR) pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 against appellee State. The Circuit Court in and for Jefferson County (Florida) summarily denied the inmate's PCR motion. The inmate appealed. The inmate also filed an application for stay of execution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate first argued that the trial court erred in denying a motion to remove appointed registry counsel because of a conflict of interest. The alleged conflict was based on the fact that registry counsel shared an office with an attorney who had earlier represented the inmate and who had missed the deadline to file a federal habeas corpus petition. However, the appellate court found that the inmate failed to show that he was denied his choice of counsel at all. The trial court allowed the inmate to exercise his choice of counsel by recognizing private counsel as counsel of record. R. Regulating Fla. Bar 4-3.7(a) did not require a trial court to remove an attorney when that attorney may have been a potential witness in a different case in a different forum when that litigation had not yet commenced. The inmate also failed to show how the trial court erred in denying a motion for appointment of experts, and, particularly, failed to allege that the experts he sought to obtain could have assisted in any viable state claim. The trial court did not err in denying the motion as to the issue of whether lethal injection constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second District Court of Appeal (DCA), Florida, certified a question of great public importance regarding what effect the trial court's giving of an erroneous jury instruction had in petitioner defendant's prosecution for second-degree murder prosecution. The DCA had ruled that giving the jury instruction did not constitute fundamental error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">If a jury returns a verdict finding a defendant guilty of second-degree murder, does a trial court commit fundamental error by giving an erroneous manslaughter by act instruction when it also gives an instruction on manslaughter by culpable negligence and the evidence supports only a theory of manslaughter by act? The supreme court answered in the affirmative and then applied the decision to the instant case to find fundamental error. Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, which was not more than one step removed from the lesser offense of manslaughter. The evidence in the case supported a finding that defendant intentionally committed an act or acts, and that the act or acts resulted in the victim's death. The evidence also supported a finding that he had no intent to kill the victim. Significantly, there was no evidence to support a finding that the victim's death resulted from culpable negligence. Thus, second-degree murder was the only offense realistically available to the jury under the evidence presented in the case and the instructions given, instructions that required the jury to find intent to kill in order to convict defendant for manslaughter by act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the DCA was quashed and the matter was remanded with directions that defendant's conviction for second-degree murder be reversed and a new trial granted.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2007); and ch. 2007-72, &sect; 2, at 156, Laws of Fla. The trial court granted the Legislature summary judgment. Petitioners appealed; the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners alleged that the challenged legislation, by which the legislature exercised control over the expenditure of tuition and student fees for state universities, violated art.

Const., an amendment to the Constitution that petitioners claimed divested the Legislature of its authority over the funding stream generated by tuition and fees and transferred it to the Florida Board of Governors. The high court disagreed. The Legislature's control over the setting of and appropriating for the expenditure of tuition and student fees derived from its power under art. VII, &sect; 1(c) and (d), Fla. Const., to raise revenue and appropriate for the expenditure of state funds. Nothing in the language of art. IX, &sect; 7, indicated an intent to transfer the legislature's power to set and appropriate tuition and fees to the Board.

Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the trial court's characterization of voluntary intoxication as the sole defense, as the jury heard both defenses, voluntary intoxication and reasonable doubt as to identity, throughout the trial and the statement did not appear to mislead the jury to believe voluntary intoxication was the sole asserted defense. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to strike to jurors who the inmate claimed were predisposed to vote for the death penalty, as statements made by the jurors were consistent with those of people willing to listen to both sides and would base their decision upon the information presented, considering both aggravating and mitigating factors. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to request two statutory mental mitigators be read to the penalty phased jury, as the defense did not present evidence to support such instructions. Since none of the inmate's individual claims provided a basis for relief, the inmate was not entitled to habeas relief based upon cumulative errors committed by trial counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Florida's Governor and others, acting as the State Board of Administration of Florida, and others, appealed a circuit court judgment to the First District Court of Appeal, which certified that the appeal, which dealt with the constitutionality of provisions of ch. 2011-68, Laws of Fla., presented issues of great public importance that required immediate resolution by the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ch. 2011-68, Laws of Fla., enacted Senate Bill 2100, which as of July 1, 2011, converted the Florida Retirement System (FRS) from noncontributory by employees to contributory, required all current FRS members to contribute 3% of their salaries to the retirement system, and eliminated the retirement cost-of-living adjustment for creditable service after the effective date of the act. Ch. 2011-68, &sect;&sect; 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 24, 26, 29, 32, 33, 39, and 40, Laws of Fla. were facially constitutional. There was no violation of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The preservation of rights statute,&nbsp;&sect; 121.011(3)(d), Fla. Stat., was not intended to bind future legislatures from prospectively altering benefits for future service performed by all members of the FRS. The prospective changes made by ch. 2011-68 were made within the authority of the legislature and did not impair any statutorily created contract rights. As no contract was breached, there was no unconstitutional taking under Art. X, &sect; 6, Fla. Const. Finally, nothing on the face of ch. 2011-68's &quot;Plan Amendment&quot; removed the subject of retirement from the collective bargaining process. Thus, there was no violation of Art. I, &sect; 6, Fla. Const.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was tried and convicted of murder, and his conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. The inmate filed various motions and proceedings, all of which resulted in denials of relief. After a second death warrant was signed, a new sentencing hearing was held. During the resentencing, the trial court found the inmate mentally retarded as a mitigating factor and gave it &quot;unquantifiable&quot; weight. The inmate was again sentenced to death. After further proceedings, an evidentiary hearing was held on his successive motion to vacate sentence. The trial court determined that the inmate's IQ was not below 70 and it denied relief. On appeal, the court found competent, substantial evidence supported that determination. As the inmate could not show a sufficiently low IQ, there was no cause to provide evidence on the other prongs of the mental retardation test. The statutorily prescribed cutoff was not arbitrary. Further, exclusion of a report was proper where the inmate did not establish the adequacy of the underlying data to support it. As mental retardation in mitigation and under Atkins were discrete legal issues, the trial court was not estopped to consider that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's multiple convictions, including two counts of first-degree murder, arose from his infliction of massive head trauma with a borrowed sawed-off shotgun on two victims. He was convicted after a jury trial and upon determining that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating ones, two death sentences were imposed. The convictions and death sentences were affirmed. After multiple postconviction rulings and remands, the inmate's postconviction relief request was summarily denied. He sought review as well as a writ of habeas corpus. The court found no ineffective assistance of trial counsel during the guilt or penalty phases upon review of multiple issues. It was noted that many of the issues raised were procedurally barred, lacking in merit, or conclusively refuted by the record. Similarly, claims of appellate counsel's ineffectiveness were not sufficiently shown. There was no Brady violation where the materiality prong was not shown, a Confrontation clause claim was without merit based on inapplicability of judicial precedents, and there was no showing that his absence from pretrial hearings frustrated the fairness of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were cited for violating the sound standards of &sect; 316.3045(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2007). The Second District Court of Appeal of Florida declared that &sect; 316.3045(1)(a) was invalid as an unreasonable restriction on the freedom of expression. The State appealed and the Second District certified a question to the state supreme court concerning whether &sect; 316.3045(1)(a) was unconstitutionally vague, overbroad, or impinged on free speech rights?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that &sect; 316.3045(1)(a), Fla. Stat., which set forth sound standards for radios and other devices in vehicles, was facially unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Florida held the &quot;plainly audible&quot; standard of &sect; 316.3045 was not unconstitutionally vague. It provided persons of common intelligence adequate notice that individuals could not amplify sound so that it was heard beyond twenty-five feet from the vehicle. Section 316.3045 treated commercial and political speech more favorably than noncommercial speech; thus, &sect; 316.3045 was content-based and subject to strict scrutiny analysis. The court held that &sect; 316.3045 was overbroad and unconstitutional, as it was not narrowly tailored to achieve the government's interests in improving traffic safety and protecting citizens from excessive noise. Severance of the provisions of &sect; 316.3045 that violated the First Amendment was not an appropriate remedy, as this was would expand the statute's reach beyond what the legislature contemplated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second District's declaration that the statute was invalid was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of first-degree murder and a sentence of death, as well as a conviction for sexual battery by use of actual physical force likely to cause serious personal injury by the Circuit Court in and for Clay County (Florida). Defendant argued that the trial court erred by finding the videotaped statements, made after waiving his Miranda rights, admissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was found dead near a kennel cage at her place of employment at approximately 6:45 a.m. Defendant as arrested approximately a month after the murder when the DNA found in the victim's vagina and rectum matched his DNA profile in the State's DNA database. Defendant's testimony at trial differed significantly from his statements in the custodial interrogation. The trial court allowed a recording of the interrogation. The jury heard the investigating officers' repeated personal opinions and proclamations of knowledge of defendant's guilt and his veracity. The police did not secure a confession throughout their 37 minute dialogue. The appellate court held that admission of those statements essentially permitted the State to improperly elicit police opinion testimony and invade the province of the jury. Further, admission of the detectives' statements also permitted the State to improperly elicit sympathy for the victim as a basis for defendant's culpability with facts not otherwise in the record. It could not be concluded that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt since the there was a danger of unfair prejudice pursuant to &sect; 90.403, Fla. Stat.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were reversed. The sentence of death was vacated. The matter was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent insured brought a statutory first-party bad faith action against petitioner Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, a state-created entity. After the trial court denied petitioner's motion to dismiss based on a claim of immunity, petitioner sought interlocutory review by a writ of prohibition or certiorari. The First Distinct Court of Appeal (Florida) denied the petition and certified conflict. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that where the legislature had enacted a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, the trial court had jurisdiction. Thus, a district court was unable to use a writ of prohibition to review a non-final order denying a party's claim of immunity from suit where a limited waiver of sovereign immunity applied. The court disapproved of the Fifth District Court of Appeals' decisions in Garfinkel and La Mer to the extent that the Fifth District used the vehicle of a writ of prohibition to review a claim of sovereign immunity where a limited waiver of sovereign immunity applied. Next, a writ of certiorari was not available. A party could not show irreparable harm, a prerequisite for certiorari review, simply through the continuation of defending a lawsuit. Furthermore, petitioner did not assert a departure from the essential requirements of law, the second requirement for certiorari, but asserted error only in an issue of statutory interpretation. Finally, the court declined to amend Fla. R. App. P. 9.130 to provide an opportunity for interlocutory appeal in this situation. Petitioner's immunity involved a matter of statutory construction that once resolved would not reoccur.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the decision to deny certiorari review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for first-degree murder, as the evidence at trial established that he took both a parent and child from their home after getting into a fight with the parent and choking the parent unconscious. He eventually led detectives to an area where the child's body was later found. Because the use of force by a detective, although highly inappropriate, did not coerce defendant to make any incriminating statement, defendant's confession was voluntary and did not require suppression. The confession was insulated from the use of force by an extended period of amicable conversation and was made to a detective other than the one who physically assaulted defendant. Comments made by the judge to defendant in the course of the judge's efforts to control the courtroom were not legally sufficient to require disqualification, as defendant continually tried to interrupt while either the judge or the State was speaking. After considering both the aggravating and mitigating factors, the supreme court found that defendant's sentence was proportionate to death sentences that it had upheld in other cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted for several crimes, including crimes against two victims who were murdered. There were two issues raised in both this case and the other murder case that required additional analysis here. The inmate argued that his counsel failed to properly authenticate medical records. The appellate court held that, regardless of any alleged deficiency relating to the medical records, the inmate suffered no prejudice. The jury and the judge at the penalty phase heard evidence regarding one of the inmate's suicide attempts through testimony of the inmate's mother. The inmate also alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the State argued based on improper evidence that the inmate had sexually battered the other murder victim. The inmate's challenges to counsel's performance were only relevant here because the inmate's conviction in the prior case was used to support the prior violent felony aggravator. The inmate's claim was not cognizable as long as the conviction underlying the aggravating factor was still a valid conviction and the other murder conviction remained a proper basis for the prior violent felony aggravator in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant said trial counsel ineffectively handled experts. The supreme court disagreed because counsel's decisions not to call them were strategic, as they could have given damaging testimony. It was not ineffective to let an expert appointed under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.216(a) be deposed because the Rule's bar against depositions did not apply, as the expert was listed as a witness. It was not ineffective to let experts give privileged information in depositions because listing them as witnesses waived privilege. Counsel were not ineffective in handling an expert in another case resulting in a conviction used as an aggravator because that valid conviction could not be collaterally attacked. It was not ineffective not to present a mitigation expert because (1) nothing showed the expert would have offered information not presented, and (2) not offering records of defendant's suicide attempts through such an expert was not prejudicial, as the jury was told of one attempt, testimony on the other attempt could have opened the door to harmful evidence, and no reasonable chance was shown that the trial court would have found statutory mitigation or that mitigators outweighed aggravators.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate filed a postconviction motion seeking to vacate his first-degree murder conviction and his death sentence. The Lake County Circuit Court (Florida) denied his motion. He appealed and petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimed his attorneys were ineffective during the guilt and penalty phases. The high court held that counsel was not deficient for making strategic decisions to stipulate that appellant's semen was found in the victim's vagina and for declining to argue that the sexual encounter was consensual. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to present expert testimony concerning false confessions, as appellant never testified that his incriminating statement was false. He failed to show counsel's performance was deficient in regard to defense DNA and blood stain experts, or in failing to call certain witnesses. His Brady and Giglio claims failed, as his counsel knew that a state DNA analyst had resigned due to misconduct and appellant did not show that the State knowingly failed to correct false, material testimony. However, counsel was ineffective in the penalty phase, as the failure to fully investigate and present substantial mental and background mitigation was not a reasonable strategic decision. His habeas claims that he was exempt from execution under U.S. Const. amend. VIII due to his mental illness, and that his appellate counsel was ineffective, were meritless.</SPAN></P>

The inmate brought a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851 motion for postconviction relief (PCR) against appellee State. The Circuit Court in and for Miami-Dade County (Florida) denied the motion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that &sect; 922.07, Fla. Stat. (2006), constituted an unconstitutional delegation of powers by the Florida legislature to the executive branch. The trial court rejected this claim as untimely. The appellate court found that, because the inmate did not base his claim on facts that occurred during a recent execution, this claim was untimely filed. The inmate's claim relating to clemency was also untimely pursuant to Rule 3.851(d)(1)(B). The inmate argued that clemency was only ripe and/or relevant close to the time a death warrant was signed, when the &quot;snapshot&quot; of the inmate was current and with a significant history on death row to evaluate. The inmate had spent over 30 years on death row at the time his appellate remedies had been exhausted. At that time the claim regarding clemency should have been raised. The inmate's claims relating to the arbitrariness and lack of safeguards in the warrant selection process had been argued and rejected by the Supreme Court of Florida. No federal or state court had accepted the argument that a prolonged stay on death row constituted cruel and unusual punishment, especially where both parties were responsible for the delay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court in and for Clay County (Florida) of first-degree murder, under &sect; 782.04, Fla. Stat. (2007); attempted sexual battery, under &sect;&sect; 794.011 and 777.04, Fla. Stat. (2007); and arson, under &sect; 806.01, Fla. Stat. (2007). The jury recommended that defendant was to be sentenced to death. The trial court entered judgment and sentence accordingly. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's body was found in the kitchen of the home in which she and defendant lived. She was stabbed and suffered blunt force trauma to her head. The house was set on fire in an apparent attempt to hide the murder. Defendant's former cell-mate testified that defendant told him that defendant went into a rage after he cut his thumb on a knife the victim pulled out from a kitchen drawer and killed her with a knife which he always kept in his pants pocket for fishing. Recordings were played of conversations between defendant and an undercover detective, whom defendant had his wife pay money to frame a friend. Video surveillance showed defendant buying gasoline shortly before the fire. On appeal, the court found that (1) the evidence was sufficient to support only the murder and arson convictions; (2) any error by the trial court, under &sect; 90.504, Fla. Stat. (2007), in allowing the State of Florida to call defendant's wife to testify was harmless; (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by preventing defense counsel in closing argument from reading portions of opinions to the jury; and (4) the trial court erred in finding the cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first-degree conviction was affirmed, but the cause was remand for a new penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

Counsel was not ineffective for telling appellant that if he testified it would &quot;kill him,&quot; as this statement was not a threat that he would receive the death penalty if he testified, but suggested that counsel believed his testimony would hurt his case. Counsel were not deficient for failing to object to the State's closing argument that appellant's motive was the attempted sexual battery of the child, as this comment was a permissible inference based on the evidence. The attorneys were prepared to present mitigation evidence, but appellant decided not to do so. Regarding the habeas petition, as appellant did not show that his trial attorneys were ineffective in handling the trial court's misstatement of the burden of proof, his appellate counsel was not ineffective for not arguing this issue on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court should have suppressed his statement to police, because the police violated the Fifth Amendment when they failed to terminate the interview after defendant invoked his right to remain silent and his confession was obtained though coercion. The supreme court disagreed, finding that defendant did not make an unequivocal invocation of the right to terminate the interview when he stated &quot;I'd rather not talk about it.&quot; While the police tactics may have walked the line, they were not coercive, as they did not incite fear in defendant and were made to press defendant and find the victim. Although one could have inferred that the detectives may have had some influence on those involved in defendant's case, the detectives' explicit statements that they could not promise defendant anything precluded a finding that defendant's rights under the Fifth Amendment were violated. The aggravating factor of cold, calculated, and premeditated was established through evidence defendant and his girlfriend talked about stealing a car, killing the owner, and hiding the body, and defendant enticed the victim to a remote location, killed her, and left her body there.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from the Circuit Court in and for Jefferson County (Florida), the case was before the court to review defendant's convictions for first-degree murder, false imprisonment as a lesser included offense of kidnapping, armed robbery with a deadly weapon, and grand theft of a motor vehicle. A jury recommended a sentence of death. The trial court accepted that recommendation and sentenced defendant to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Campbell v. State, defendant contended that the trial court's sentencing order discounted the record evidence with regard to the mitigating effect of his mental health without providing a basis for discounting this evidence through a proper analysis and explanation. The supreme court agreed. The sentencing order violated the requirements articulated in Campbell because the trial court did not expressly evaluate, in a well-reasoned fashion, how the evidence presented failed to support the mitigating evidence presented by defendant. Rather, it merely gave a brief summary of its findings with regard to the mitigators, and did not expressly and specifically articulate why the evidence presented failed to support the proposed statutory mitigators, and why that same evidence warranted the allocation of slight weight to the nonstatutory mitigation evidence presented. Sufficient evidence supported defendant's murder conviction, as defendant confessed to his cellmate that he intentionally robbed and killed the victim by stabbing him several times with a knife and hitting him multiple times with a shovel, after which he stole the victim's truck and $375.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of guilt were affirmed, but the case was reversed and remanded for the limited purpose of requiring the trial court to provide a revised sentencing order that contained a sentencing evaluation in compliance with Campbell.</SPAN></P>

His guilty plea was knowing and voluntary, despite an earlier claim that counsel was forcing him to plead guilty, because he said (1) he understood its consequences, the rights he gave up, and the fact that he would either receive life without parole or the death penalty, (2) he had not been forced to plead guilty or promised anything for his plea, and (3) the decision to plead guilty was his own.

The supreme court held the totality of the circumstances test was properly applied to find his confessions were voluntary because all surrounding facts were considered. His prior victims could testify at sentencing because (1) the prior crimes were not made a central feature, and (2) improperly combining a prior crime's facts with those of the current crime was uncontested and not fundamental error. Defendant's sentences when he committed the murder were admissible because they showed the &quot;under sentence of imprisonment&quot; aggravator. The heinous, atrocious, and cruel (HAC) aggravator applied because the murder was conscienceless, pitiless, and needlessly torturous. The cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator did not apply because (1) no heightened plan to kill the victim was shown, and (2) it was speculative to find defendant lay in wait or to rely on his post-crime acts to show preplanning. The error was harmless because other aggravators applied. Extreme mental or emotional disturbance did not apply because expert evidence refuted it. A death sentence was proportionate because the prior violent felony and HAC aggravators applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant/petitioner sought to vacate his conviction and death sentence from the Circuit Court in and for Pinellas County (Florida), and the denial of postconviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.851, primarily arguing he received insufficient assistance of counsel and was denied a fair trial and sentence under U.S. Const. amend. VI, VIII, and XIV. He also sought for a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 3(b)(1), (9).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the brutal killing of his girlfriend. His seven year-old daughter witnessed part of the attack, and was allowed to testify against him. He argued that the postconviction court erred in denying relief based on his nine claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, and asserted cumulative error as a basis for relief. There was no evidence that counsel failed to diligently investigate DNA results in appellant's shoe, or a bloody handprint. Although officers interviewing the child exhibited bias in a videotaped interview, she was properly permitted to testify. The jury was already aware of appellant's criminal history, and there was no actual conflict with his trial attorneys. Evidence of a stray fingerprint was clearly made available to the defense, so there was no Brady violation. Many witnesses who were not under subpoena failed to testify in the penalty phase. However, there was no reasonable probability that the additional mitigating evidence would have convinced five jurors to change their recommendations from death to life imprisonment. Habeas relief was not warranted. The lethal injection process was not so painful as to be cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the motion for postconviction relief was affirmed, and the petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted that &sect; 893.101, Fla. Stat., is facially constitutional and that the trial court therefore erred in granting the motion to dismiss. The supreme court agreed and concluded that &sect;&sect; 893.13 and 893.101, Fla. Stat. (2011) were rationally related to the Legislature's goal of controlling substances that have a high potential for abuse and did not interfere with any constitutionally protected rights. Because there is no legally recognized use for controlled substances outside the circumstances identified by the statute, prohibiting the sale, manufacture, delivery, or possession of those substances without requiring proof of knowledge of the illicit nature of the substances did not criminalize innocuous conduct or impinge on the exercise of some constitutionally protected freedom. Thus, the Legislature did not violate due process by defining lack of knowledge of the illicit nature as an affirmative defense to the offenses set out in ch. 893, Fla. Stat. The Legislature's decision to treat lack of such knowledge as an affirmative defense did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof in a criminal offense to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Circuit Court in and for Escambia County (Florida), denying his motion to vacate his convictions of first-degree murder and sentences of death filed under Fla. R. Civ. P. 3.850. Appellant also petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found appellant guilty of first-degree murder and returned a life recommendation. Subsequently, at a Spencer-like hearing, trial counsel presented character letters on appellant's behalf to the trial judge. The trial court disagreed with the jury's recommendation and sentenced appellant to death. Based on the evidentiary testimony presented during the postconviction proceeding concerning appellant's troubled background, the court held that trial counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation into available mitigation. At the evidentiary hearing, counsel testified that he did not believe anyone on the defense team examined the court files of appellant's prior record. Moreover, counsel did not obtain a mitigation expert in the case. In addition, counsel had a concern that not much information was provided to a psychologist who interviewed appellant, yet counsel failed to assert that he took any steps to alleviate that concern. The court concluded that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate, develop, and present available mitigating evidence that would have legally precluded the trial court from overriding the jury's life recommendation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the circuit court's denial of postconviction relief as it pertained to appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase. The court denied appellant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court vacated appellant's death sentences and remanded for the imposition of sentences of life in prison.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence, which included multiple admissions of guilt was sufficient to permit a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant killed the victim while he was in the commission of, or attempting to commit or escape from, a burglary, robbery, or a sexual battery. Further, the nature and number of the wounds inflicted in the confrontation provided a basis for a reasonable jury to conclude that defendant killed the victim in a premeditated manner, with a conscious intent to kill. Considering the totality of the circumstances and comparing the case with other similar capital cases, the trial court did not err in imposing the death sentence where the three aggravating circumstances were horrendous and greatly outweighed the comparatively insignificant mitigating factors proven by defendant. Furthermore, a juror, who had been arrested but not yet formally charged by a prosecutor for a crime, was not &quot;under prosecution&quot; so as to render him statutorily unqualified to serve as a juror under &sect; 40.013(1), Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Florida legislature enacted a statute that limited the communication by a public insurance adjuster with a potential claimant, appellee public insurance adjuster sought declaratory and injunctive relief. He alleged, inter alia, that the statute,&nbsp;&sect; 626.854(6), Fla. Stat. (2008) violated his constitutional free speech right. The state financial services chief contended that the statute was not quite as broad as was alleged. The trial court ruled that the statute was constitutional. The appellate court reversed and found that the statute's plain language prohibited all public adjuster-initiated contact, whether electronic, written, or oral, and, thus regulated commercial speech. As a result, it found that application of the Central Hudson test showed that the statute was more extensive than necessary to serve the State's interest in promoting ethical conduct. The state supreme court, agreeing that the Central Hudson test applied, found that the statute unconstitutionally restricted the commercial speech of public adjusters because it was not narrowly tailored to serve the State's interests in ensuring ethical conduct by public adjusters and protecting homeowners.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the First District properly held that the Lien Law was a special law which created a lien based on a private contract between the hospital and its patient, and was thus unconstitutional under &sect; 11(a)(9). It was error, however, to hold the ordinance unconstitutional as being enacted pursuant to an unconstitutional law, as it was not enacted pursuant to the Lien Law. Furthermore, the ordinance was not inconsistent with state law under Art. VIII, &sect; 1(g), Fla. Const., and  ordinances could not violate Art. III, &sect; 11(a), Fla. Const. Because the ordinance was constitutional, the First District erred in reversing the trial court's judgment in favor of the hospital. Finally, in denying the insurer's claim for attorney fees pursuant to its settlement offer, the trial court properly applied &sect; 768.79(1), Fla. Stat.

Stat. (2009). The supreme court disagreed because (1) it did not say he killed the former girlfriend, and (2) it was only used to show he knew the body's location. His secretly recorded statement to a friend was admissible because (1) no coercion was shown, (2) he was not confronted with evidence of his guilt, and (3) he could leave. Victim impact evidence of the victim's former occupations was admissible, under &sect; 921.141(7), Fla. Stat. (2009), because it showed his uniqueness. A statement that the crime deserved just punishment was admissible because the jury was told not to consider any statements as recommending a particular punishment. Defendant's alleged drug addiction did not bar finding a cold, calculated, and premeditated aggravator because (1) nothing supported his self-reports of addiction, and (2) he carefully devised a plan to kill the victim. The pecuniary gain aggravator was properly found because admissible evidence showed he was angry that the victim caused him to stop receiving money.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a complaint against respondent county challenging Broward County, Fla., Charter art. II, &sect; 2.02 (2010), which provided for term limits on county commissioners. The Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) held that the Florida Constitution permitted the county to impose term limits. The court reviewed the Fourth District's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that its implied prohibition in Cook v. City of Jacksonville, 823 So. 2d 86 (Fla. 2002) against term limits for county officers and county commissioners from the lack of inclusion in Fla. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4 overly restricted the authority of counties pursuant to their home rule powers under the Florida Constitution. Interpreting Florida's Constitution to find implied restrictions on powers otherwise authorized was unsound in principle. Express restrictions had to be found, not implied. Receding from the Cook decision would promote stability in the law by allowing the counties to govern themselves, including term limits of their officials, in accordance with their home rule authority. Because the qualifying deadlines had not occurred, there were no reliance issues implicated by a ruling receding from Cook. Accordingly, the court receded from Cook and the rationale it relied upon in Thomas v. State ex rel. Cobb, 58 So. 2d 173 (Fla. 1952). Therefore, the term limits provided in the charter did not violate the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court approved the Fourth District's decision on different grounds than stated by the Fourth District. It held that the term limits did not violate the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Const., and directed the Legislature to adopt a new joint resolution of legislative apportionment conforming to the judgment of the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prior declaratory judgment expressly declared invalid the Senate's numbering scheme and eight Senate districts.

Pursuant to the court's directive, the Legislature reconvened by special session and adopted a revised apportionment plan that sought to remedy the constitutional infirmities apparent on the face of the invalidated plan. The revised plan redrew the eight previously invalidated districts and also changed the boundaries of multiple other districts, which the Senate asserted were the result of the changes made to the eight invalidated districts. Because of the revisions, 26 of the original 40 Senate districts were reconfigured in some manner. Several parties filed briefs in opposition to the redrawn plan. However, the opponents failed to demonstrate that the revised Senate plan, as a whole or with respect to any individual district, violated Florida's constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved for a continuance, requesting additional time to test for mental retardation. The request was denied. However, the trial court accommodated defendant by continuing the Spencer hearing. After the Spencer hearing but before the sentencing hearing, the trial court denied defendant's mental retardation claim, noting that the claim would have failed even under the preponderance of the evidence standard. The trial court did not err in denying his motion for continuance because defendant requested an indefinite continuance at a late stage in the proceedings to investigate information within his control. In any event, defendant was not unduly prejudiced by the trial court's decision against giving him additional time to investigate mental retardation prior to the conclusion of the penalty phase. Because his IQ score and academic problems were presented as mitigation without the continuance and because he was unable to present any further evidence of retardation after a post-penalty-phase continuance, he was not unduly prejudiced by the denial. Also, there was competent, substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that he was not mentally retarded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Within thirty days of receiving the Attorney General's petition, and after permitting adversary interests to present their views, the court had a mandatory obligation under the Florida Constitution to render the declaratory judgment determining the validity of the apportionment plans.

Const., which was imposed by the voters and clearly acted as a restraint on legislative discretion in drawing apportionment plans, were defined for the first time. With the addition of the Fair Districts Amendment, the limitations on legislative authority in apportionment decisions had increased and the constitutional yardstick had more measurements. The court entered judgment declaring the apportionment plan of the House of Representatives, as contained in the joint resolution, to be valid under the Florida Constitution and declaring the apportionment plan of the Senate, as contained in the joint resolution, to be constitutionally invalid.

Stat. (2002). Petitioner challenged an order of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit, DeSoto County (Florida), which denied his application for a writ of habeas corpus, seeking total discharge and dismissal of the civil commitment petition with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the circuit court's factual findings were supported by competent, substantial evidence. Neither the Act nor the Constitution entitled petitioner to the treatment he sought as a non-committed detainee. Petitioner failed to establish that the Florida Civil Commitment Center (FCCC) treatment program was constitutionally defective. The evidence established valid and substantial reasons for precluding non-committed detainees from fully participating in the FCCC's comprehensive sexual offender treatment program (SOTP). The Act neither mandated nor permitted trial courts to order that pretrial detainees receive full access to the FCCC's comprehensive SOTP. Because the delay in petitioner's commitment trial had been made for tactical reasons at his own request, his detention did not result in a constitutional violation. Petitioner agreed to an indefinite waiver of the statutory trial period, &sect; 394.916(2), Fla. Stat. (20011), for strategic reasons, he never objected to his continued confinement, and the State had been prepared and ready for trial. For tactical reasons, petitioner delayed his trial for years, and his commitment trial would proceed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's death sentence was found to be proportional, as the case fell into the class of cases with the most aggravating and least mitigating circumstances, and under the supreme court's precedent, defendant was not entitled to relief under Ring v. Arizona. His conviction of first-degree murder under both a felony-murder theory and a premeditated murder theory was supported by the evidence, as he admitted to entering the victim's home to commit burglary, and the evidence demonstrated that he took a.22 caliber rifle into the house, where he remained for a sufficient period to allow for calm reflection, and then shot and killed the victim.</SPAN></P>

In the penalty phase, the trial court had no obligation to factor in the defense's offer to stipulate when ruling on the admission of evidence regarding prior felony convictions for false imprisonment while armed and sexual battery against an ex-girlfriend because any relevant evidence as to defendant's character was admissible under &sect; 921.141(1), Fla. Stat. (2001). Furthermore, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for acquittal on the kidnapping charge under &sect; 787.01(1)(a), Fla. Stat. (2000), because the evidence supported the finding that defendant confined the victim with an intent to inflict bodily harm upon or to terrorize her. Although the victim successfully exited the vehicle where she was confined, the confinement continued as she was chased along the side of the road.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee issuer of a bond sued appellant contractor, seeking indemnification. After an initial verdict was set aside, the contractor sent an offer of judgment pursuant to &sect; 768.79, Fla. Stat. (2006), which was rejected. Later, the verdict was reinstated on appeal. The contractor's motion for attorney's fees under &sect; 768.79 was denied. The contractor appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit certified questions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit was based on a contract between the parties which included a choice-of-law clause that provided for the substantive law of Michigan to apply to disputes under the contract. The third of the three certified questions asked, inter alia, whether &sect; 768.79 applied where the parties had contractually agreed to be bound by the substantive laws of another jurisdiction. The court found that, because an award under Florida's offer of judgment statute was a substantive right, &sect; 768.79 did not apply in instances where the parties had so agreed. The contractor was not entitled to an award under &sect; 768.79. That statute was inapplicable to this case because the parties had agreed to be bound by the substantive laws of Michigan. The court presumed that the choice-of-law clause was valid, and found no sufficient public policy concern to override the parties' right to choose the law of the particular forum that governed the substantive portions of their contract. BDO Seidman, LLP v. British Car Auctions, Inc., 802 So. 2d 366 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2001), and Bennett v. Morales, 845 So. 2d 1002 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2003), were disapproved to the extent they conflicted with this ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The third certified question was answered in the negative. The first two questions were therefore rendered moot, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured filed suit against defendant insurer seeking insurance benefits for losses allegedly caused by a sinkhole. A jury returned a verdict for the insurer, and the insured appealed. The Second District Court of Appeal (Florida) in Warfel v. Universal Insurance Co. of North America, 36 So. 3d 136 (Fla. 2d DCA 2010), reversed and remanded for a new trial. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured filed a sinkhole claim; the insurer hired a geotechnical, geological, and engineering firm to investigate the claim. The report concluded that the damage to the insured property was caused by shrinkage, thermal stress, and differential settlement, all of which were excluded from coverage under the policy. Under &sect; 627.7073(1)(c), Fla. Stat. (2005), the report was entitled to a presumption of correctness. The trial court instructed the jury that it was to presume the report was correct. The court held that the sinkhole statutes did not apply to the litigation context; therefore, the trial court's application of &sect; 90.304, Fla. Stat., to &sect; 627.7073(1)(c) and the treatment of this statute as evidentiary was incorrect. The presumption applied only to the initial claim process and investigation that insurers were required to follow in accepting or denying sinkhole claims. To the extent the insured failed to preserve his objection, the error was a fundamental error. The instruction removed a critical factual issue from the jury, i.e., whether a sinkhole caused the damage.</SPAN></P>

Stat. (2006). Even if it did, Art. X, &sect; 25, Fla. Const. required disclosure. A blank application contained no information and, thus, was not a document considered in a decision-making process. Art. X mandated disclosure because, in this suit for negligent grant of medical staff privileges, the blank application was a record of an adverse medical incident. The Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 11101 et seq., did not provide for confidentiality of peer review records or communications-it provided only immunity for those who provide information to peer review bodies and may subsequently have faced civil action due to that participation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant probationer pleaded guilty to drug and theft charges and was placed on probation, with a condition that he pay restitution. An affidavit of violation of probation was filed based on allegations that the probationer failed to make the required monthly payments, and his probation was revoked. He appealed, and the Third District Court of Appeal (Florida), affirmed. The probationer again appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In direct conflict to the Third District's decision, the Second, Fourth, and Fifth District Courts of Appeal had held that the burden of proof was on the State to establish that the probationer had the ability to pay in order to demonstrate the willfulness of the violation. The court held that the probation violation order was based on the probationer's failure to pay restitution, without regard to whether he had the ability to pay but willfully refused to do so. This was contrary to constitutional due process principles and to the protection against imprisonment for debt in art. I, &sect; 11, Fla. Const. The State was required to present sufficient evidence of the probationer's willfulness, which included evidence on ability to pay, to support the trial court's finding of willfulness. After evidence of willfulness was introduced by the State, the burden could then be properly shifted to the probationer to assert and prove inability to pay, as required under &sect; 948.06, Fla. Stat. (2011). However, it was unconstitutional to require the probationer to prove inability to pay by clear and convincing evidence--a higher burden than that required of the State to prove the violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate appealed the denial of his petition for postconviction relief, but the supreme court affirmed, stating that he failed to prove that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel adequately prepared for impeaching the girlfriend of defendant's codefendant. Further, counsel impeached her at length concerning her criminal history and elicited from her that she had told lies, had lied to the police by giving them her sister's name, and had lied in letters in 1996. Trial counsel also introduced the 1996 letters into evidence in which the girlfriend wrote that she did not know who was the shooter. In light of that, failing to introduce additional, cumulative evidence of her criminal history and failing to introduce certified criminal convictions into evidence did not constitute deficient performance. Further, failing to hear the attorney expert's opinion on whether counsel was ineffective did not contribute to the postconviction court's denial of the inmate's ineffective assistance of counsel claims on which an evidentiary hearing was granted. Accordingly, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the Circuit Court in and for Indian River County (Florida), which denied his amended and supplemental motions for postconviction relief filed pursuant to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction arose from the May 1988 murder of a woman. Of relevance was a triple homicide that occurred three days before that murder. The Court rejected appellant's claim that newly discovered evidence showed that a witness's testimony was false as appellant failed to present any evidence to refute the testimony. The Court also agreed with the postconviction court's denial of appellant's claim that newly discovered evidence established that the FBI provided false testimony at his trial regarding comparative bullet lead analysis (CBLA). The Court held that a letter from the FBI did not meet the first prong of the case law standard for establishing newly discovered evidence because the letter was not in existence at the time of appellant's 1991 trial for the underlying murder. As to the triple homicide, the court did find that the postconviction court erred in concluding that the CBLA claim did not constitute newly discovered evidence but that it would not have produced an acquittal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The JQC found, and the court agreed, that the judge had violated &sect; 106.08(1)(a) and 106.08(3)(a), Fla. Stat.

These violations also constituted violations of the requirement of Fla. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 1 that judges maintain high standards of conduct and the requirement of Fla. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 2A that judges respect and comply with the law and act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. Additionally, the judge knowingly engaged in the practice of law in representing his mother in the subsequent foreclosure of the loan she had taken out to assist him, in violation of Fla. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 5G, by negotiating with counsel for his mother's mortgagee and by filing a notice of appearance on her behalf.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Second District Court of Appeal (Florida), which affirmed the circuit court's denial of his motion for postconviction relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 on the ground that his claim that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to enter judgment was barred by the time limits of rule 3.850. He argued that under rule 3.850, the Office of the Statewide Prosecutor (OSP) lacked jurisdiction to prosecute him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court approved the Second District's affirmance of the circuit court's denial of defendant's postconviction motion. Defendant's challenge to the jurisdiction of the OSP was barred by the time limitations of rule 3.850. Any lack of jurisdiction by the OSP did not divest the circuit court of jurisdiction. Even assuming that the OSP lacked jurisdiction to prosecute defendant, such a defect in the information would not divest the circuit court of jurisdiction over the felony offenses charged against him. The issue of whether an information was filed by the OSP or a state attorney had no effect on the circuit court's subject matter jurisdiction. Because the information charged defendant with multiple felonies, the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction over his case pursuant to &sect; 26.012(2)(d), Fla. Stat. (2001). A prosecuting officer representing the State filed an information in the circuit court. That information provided defendant with actual notice of the charges against him. A conviction resulting from an information signed by a state officer lacking authority was not void ab initio but was, at most, voidable upon timely challenge.</SPAN></P>

Const. recognized an exactions taking where there was no compelled dedication of any interest in real property to public use and the alleged exaction was a non-land-use monetary condition for permit approval, which never occurred and no permit was ever issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A landowner requested permits from the water management district to develop commercial property. When the permits were denied, he brought an inverse condemnation claim asserting an improper exaction by the district. The trial court held that the district had effected a taking of the property. Pursuant to &sect; 373.617(3), Fla. Stat. (2002), the district issued the permits, and the trial court subsequently awarded the landowner a sum for a temporary taking of the property. The intermediate appellate court affirmed. However, the intermediate court erroneously applied the Nollan/Dolan exactions test because the district did not condition approval of the permits on the landowner dedicating any portion of his interest in the property in any way to public use. Further, the landowner never expended any funds towards the performance of offsite mitigation, and nothing was ever taken from him. U.S. Const. amend. V and Art. X, &sect; 6(a), Fla. Const. did not recognize an exactions taking where there was no compelled dedication of any interest in property to public use and the alleged exaction was a non-land-use monetary condition for permit approval, which never occurred and no permit was issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, age 33, was convicted of the sexual battery and murder of a 13-year-old victim who was living with her family in the same motel as defendant in Panama City. Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence of sexual battery because the victim consented to have sex with him and was in fact, the aggressor. There was some evidence of consent, including the fact that the victim's clothing was not torn; however, there was evidence that she was shy and would not talk to strangers and that she was menstruating; there was also bruising of her pubic area. The jury chose not to believe defendant, and the evidence supported its decision. Because the defense did not argue below that the trial court was required to find a connection between the aggravator that defendant was on felony probation and the murder, his claim that such a connection was required was unpreserved. Based on the length of time it took to strangle the victim, using both defendant's hands and the repeated use of a telephone cord, there was sufficient evidence that defendant committed the homicide with a premeditated design to effect the victim's death as required by &sect; 782.04(1)(a)1, Fla. Stat. (2008).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his postconviction motion, the inmate claimed that he was mentally retarded. During the hearing, the results of four intelligence quotient (IQ) were submitted, and the scores of all four tests fell at or around the range of 70-75. The trial court found that this range was consistent with a diagnosis of mental retardation and vacated the death sentence. The appellate court held that this was error. In order to prove exemption from execution under &sect; 921.137, Fla. Stat. and Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.203, a defendant had to establish an IQ of 70 or below. The trial court was obligated to follow this interpretation of &sect; 921.137(1) and Rule 3.203(b). The parties could not have agreed to create a different legal standard. The Supreme Court of the United States had relegated to the states the task of determining specific rules for who could have been classified as mentally retarded and had not mandated a specific IQ score or range for a finding of mental retardation in the capital sentencing process. The Supreme Court of Florida had specifically rejected the contention that the standard error of measurement had to be factored into the IQ score.</SPAN></P>

While the statement was improper, the supreme court concluded that the trial court did not err by not granting a mistrial, because the defense objection was sustained and the jury was instructed to disregard the remark, preventing any prejudice to defendant. Defendant also argued that the trial court improperly denied his motion for mistrial for being shackled in the presence of the jury during the guilt phase. The supreme court found no error, noting that it was unlikely that any juror saw defendant in shackles when the jury room door was opened briefly as defendant passed in shackles. The supreme court also concluded that, contrary to defendant's claim, there was no discovery violation, as defense counsel received all the evidence presented at trial, including both DNA analysis reports obtained by the State.</SPAN></P>
