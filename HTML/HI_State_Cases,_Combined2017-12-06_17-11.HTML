<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i), separately convicted three defendants of camping without a permit, which violated Honolulu, Haw., Rev. Ordinances &sect; 10-1.3(a)(2) (1990, as am. Ord. 96-58). The trial court sentenced them to pay a $ 20 fine, payment of which was suspended pending appeal. Defendants filed separate appeals, which the intermediate appellate court consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each arrested by citation for allegedly camping without a permit at a city park. Defendants moved to dismiss the charges against them. The intermediate appellate court uncovered no evidence of a plainly appearing legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for the camping-without-a-permit offense defined by the camping ordinance. Therefore, pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 702-213(1) (1993), the camping-without-a-permit offense was reduced to a violation punishable by fine, forfeiture, or other civil penalty unless defendants were specifically charged pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 702-213(2) (1993) with committing the offense with a negligent state of mind. To determine the state of mine element, the case had to be remanded to the trial court. In addition, the camping ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because most individuals had a common-sense understanding of what camping involved and the definition of camping provided by the director of the city parks department provided sufficiently definite guidelines and examples to put a person of ordinary intelligence on fair notice of the types of activities that constituted camping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments were vacated and the cases were remanded to the trial court to determine the classification of the offense with which defendants were charged. If the charge did not allege a negligent-state-of-mind element, a judgment would be entered against them for camping without a permit as a civil violation. If the charge included a negligent or higher state of mind, they would be convicted of a misdemeanor offense of camping without a permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed a decision of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i) summarily dismissing his Haw. R. Penal P. 40 petition (Rule 40 petition) for post-conviction relief. The inmate was convicted of second-degree murder under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 707-701.5 (1985 &amp; Supp. 1990) and 706-656 (Supp. 1990).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mistrial was declared, and the inmate opted to enter into a plea agreement whereby the State would recommend 10 years. The trial court deferred to the Hawai'i Parol Authority (HPA) for sentencing. The inmate's attorney did not appear at the sentencing hearing and the inmate was sentenced to 30 years. The court held that there was no legal duty on the part of the prosecution to disclose to the inmate all the potential consequences of the HPA Guidelines. Also, the colloquy at the guilty plea provided evidence that the plea was not based on an improper promise by defense counsel, and no colorable claim was established that counsel's alleged failure to inform the inmate about the HPA Guidelines constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. However, a colorable claim was definitely presented that the inmate was denied the effective assistance of counsel at his HPA minimum-term hearing and did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to the presence of counsel. Accordingly, an evidentiary hearing, was required and the circuit court erred in summarily denying that ground of the Rule 40 petition as being frivolous and without a trace of support from the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated that part of the order that summarily dismissed the ground regarding ineffective assistance of counsel at the HPA hearing. The court remanded for an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i), without holding a hearing, denied petitioner's Haw. R. Penal P. 40 petition, in which, inter alia, he claimed that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel from his trial counsel. The court found that petitioner's claims had been previously ruled upon, waived, or were patently frivolous and without a trace of support in the record. Petitioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, petitioner claimed, inter alia, that he had received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because instead of arguing that the State was allowed to argue that the circuit court had the last word on the city police department's identification procedure, counsel argued that the State was allowed to argue that the circuit court and not the jury, had the last word on the identification of petitioner as the perpetrator. And, that the circuit court reversibly erred when it failed to acknowledge the trial court's error in failing to provide a curative instruction after the deputy prosecuting attorney told the jury that, with respect to the propriety of the identifications, &quot;the court has the last word.&quot; Upon careful review of the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the issues raised by the parties, the appellate court held that the circuit court properly denied the rule 40 petition. Pursuant to rule 40(a)(3), petitioner's claims were previously ruled upon or were waived, and pursuant to rule 40(f), were patently frivolous and without trace of support either in the record or from other evidence submitted by petitioner.</SPAN></P>

His parole was revoked for the balance of his five-year maximum sentence. He filed a petition for postconviction relief. The trial court found that his claims were without merit, patently frivolous, and without a trace of support in the record. The trial court denied the petition without a hearing. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly held that petitioner's postconviction claims were patently frivolous and without support in the record. Further, Haw. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On June 12, 2003, the department of human services (DHS) removed a child from its mother's physical custody and assumed foster custody. DHS then placed the child in the home of appellant father. On July 10, 2003, due to concerns about the father's drug use, DHS placed the child in a licensed foster home. Inter alia, the Family Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i) terminated the father's parental rights. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the father contended that on November 18, 2004, when the court entered the order awarding permanent custody, it was reasonably foreseeable that, prior to July 10, 2005, the father would become willing and able to provide the child with a safe family home. In light of the record, and pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 587-73 (2005) the appellate court held that that contention had no merit. The father noted that he never committed actual harm to his child. The supposed harm was all imagined from the possibility of harm because of his drug use. He contended that he was not given sufficient time to prepare for the care of the child and was not given the help needed to get into a substance abuse program that he needed. That contention had no merit. The father's &quot;polysubstance dependence&quot; and selling of drugs proved his inability to provide the child with a safe family home. Moreover, the father's admission that he used drugs and needed to get into a substance abuse program contradicted his statement that he was in disagreement with each and every finding and conclusion that even tended to say that the father could not, at the time of the trial, provide a safe home for his child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant and disregarding a red signal. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not expressly deny defense counsel the opportunity to make a closing argument because defense counsel never affirmatively requested an opportunity to present a closing argument. Defense counsel did not object when the trial court announced its verdict without hearing closing arguments and did not file any posttrial motions requesting reconsideration in light of the lack of closing arguments. The transcripts revealed that after defendant declined to testify, the trial court asked the parties if they had anything further. While the transcripts did not indicate any verbal response from defense counsel, they did not reflect any interest on his part to make a closing argument. The record reflected that the trial judge was extraordinarily patient and accommodating with defense counsel and that if defense counsel had wanted to make a closing argument, the trial judge would not have denied the request. Under the circumstances, the court held that defendant waived his right to make a closing argument.</SPAN></P>

When the jury instructions on the charged offense were read and considered as a whole, the appellate court could not conclude that the instructions given were prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading. In that regard, the trial court polled the jury and confirmed that each of the juror's verdicts was unanimous.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the judge's ex parte communication with the prosecutor and the State's lead prosecution witness without the presence of defendant's attorney was not harmless error. The court of appeals disagreed. The State conceded that the communication was ex parte, but argued that the communication did not deny defendant's right to a fair trial. Nothing in the record demonstrated that the meeting induced the witness to testify against defendant or that any kind of deal was struck. The circuit court was not aware of the witness's decision to testify at the time defendant requested a mistrial. The circuit court disclosed to defendant what had occurred in chambers, and he did not challenge the representations made by the circuit court judge. The witness's testimony was substantially consistent with defendant's testimony, and defendant himself testified that he confronted the victim with a loaded gun. There was convincing evidence that the jury's deliberations, as a whole, were not biased by the undisclosed communication, making the ex parte communication harmless error.</SPAN></P>

An officer received information from the CI detailing that he had been a personal friend of one defendant for the past year, and that the CI knew defendant's height, weight, and age. The CI was approached by defendant within the past year and offered to sell drugs to the CI. The CI also knew that defendant used different vehicles to complete his drug transactions in an effort to thwart law enforcement efforts. The search warrant was issued on the above information and the controlled buy occurred with defendant delivering the drugs to the CI in a hand-to-hand transaction. Therefore, the search warrant was based on probable cause, and the trial court did not err by denying the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second Circuit Court, Hawaii, found defendant guilty of practicing law without a license in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 605-14 (1993). Upon a finding that defendant had previously violated &sect; 605-14, she was sentenced to a one-year term of probation subject to conditions which included that she pay restitution to the complainants and perform 200 hours of community service.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 605-14 (1993) was unconstitutionally vague because it did not define what was meant by the &quot;practice of law,&quot; and that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct in eliciting, and the trial court committed plain error in allowing, testimony regarding a complainants conversation with a lawyer. The appellate court found that defendant waived her vagueness argument as she did not challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 605-14 at trial. Even considering her complaint, the appellate court held that defendant was not entitled to relief. Considering her extensive involvement in preparing the complainants' divorce pleadings and her providing the complainants with legal advice, &sect; 605-14, as applied to defendant's conduct, was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute's prohibition against the unlicensed &quot;practice of law&quot; and court decisions interpreting that phrase gave defendant fair warning that her conduct was illegal. Further, the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct as any attorney-client privilege relating to the complainant's conversation with the lawyer was for the complainant, and not defendant, to assert.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant's vehicle fail to stop at a stop sign or use a lighted turn signal and initiated a traffic stop.

The State also contended that even if the police engaged in the traffic stop for an investigatory purpose, there was at least reasonable suspicion to support the stop. The appellate court noted that the police officer's stop of defendant's vehicle for an observed violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 291C-84(b) was justified, as the stop was effected in connection with an observed violation for the purpose of issuing a citation and was not merely pretextual.

The court of appeals disagreed. Although the officer did not have personal knowledge because the only foundation laid was that the officer had collected and assembled the police reports concerning the investigation and was aware of some of its contents, the error was harmless. The officer's testimony that no drugs were found on defendant was consistent with his own testimony that he discarded the ice without detection by the police. Thus, the testimony to which defendant objected did not prejudice his case. In addition, the State produced compelling evidence of defendant guilt. He attempted to cash a check that had recently been stolen from a person defendant had never met. In an attempt to hurry the teller, defendant lied by claiming that he had to &quot;leave for work&quot; when he was unemployed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of one count of prostitution, in violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1200 (1993 and 2004 Supp.). The Honolulu Division of the District Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii) sentenced defendant to a six-month term of probation and ordered her to pay a $ 500 fine and $ 25 to the Criminal Injury Compensation Fund. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial judge's factual findings were clearly erroneous and that there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction. The appellate court disagreed that defendant merely informed the officer of what she charged and found that the officer's testimony provided substantial evidence that defendant made an offer to engage in sex with the officer for a fee which he accepted, resulting in an agreement. Defendant also claimed that the trial judge's questioning of the officer deprived her of a fair trial because the questions were intended to remedy shortcomings in the State's evidence. The trial judge did not overstep permissible bounds in questioning the officer, but sought pertinent and material information and to clarify testimony that the parties had elicited. As for defendant's claim that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1200 (1993 and 2004 Supp.) violated her freedom of speech, the appellate court first noted that the First Amendment did not protect speech which is part of a course of criminal conduct. Finally, the appellate court held that &sect; 712-1200 was not vague, but was sufficiently clear such that defendant was not required to guess at its meaning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the parole board was prejudiced against him because of his race, that his due process rights were violated because of his race and legal work done for himself and others, his parole was illegally revoked for a first violation, that prison conditions interfered with his parole opportunities, that he was denied access to the courts, and that the trial court denied him access to be heard. The appellate court noted that defendant did not assert any new claims in his Haw. R. Penal P. 40 petition for which relief could have been provided. The appellate court held that the issues presented were previously raised and ruled upon, waived, or had no merit; therefore, the trial court properly denied defendant's petition without a hearing because he did not show a colorable claim.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence because officers' detention and pat-down search were illegal. The court of appeals disagreed. The officers were lawfully at defendant's residence to execute bench warrants for his girlfriend. As the officers approached the residence, they encountered defendant, who immediately concealed his right hand behind his back, and refused the officers' repeated requests to show his right hand. He then slipped something from his right hand into his pocket, leaving a visible bulge in that pocket. In addition, the officers knew that they were executing warrants for serious drug offenses, that guns and the use of violence were often associated with drug crimes, and that defendant might have a desire to prevent his girlfriend's arrest. Even if the officers lacked a reasonable suspicion that defendant was involved in criminal activity, they were justified in fearing that he would use a concealed weapon against them if they did not temporarily detain him and perform a pat-down search for weapons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction for attempting to distribute at least one-eighth ounce of methamphetamine was reversed. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a jury's verdict, petitioner was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree and the included offense of reckless manslaughter. His conviction and the imposition of an extended sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. The Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, Hawai'i, subsequently denied his petition to correct illegally imposed sentence and conviction pursuant to Haw. R. App. P. 35. He appealed, asserting double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the primary issue centered on the fact that petitioner had originally pled nolo contendere to murder in the second degree. The Hawai'i Supreme Court had allowed him to withdraw said plea. On remand, he was then recharged and convicted of both sexual assault in the first degree and the included offense of reckless manslaughter. In the instant action he asserted double jeopardy, in that he had been convicted of sexual assault in the first degree after the State had struck that charge down in an earlier agreement. He also asserted he was sentenced to an illegally imposed extended term sentence by a judge instead of by a jury. However, the appellate court held that once petitioner had withdrawn his no contest plea, the State was constitutionally free to try him on the sexual assault charge it had dismissed pursuant to the plea bargain. As to his sentence, the Hawai'i Supreme Court had previously rejected his same argument (basically an Apprendi argument), and that decision became the law of the case. Finally, petitioner was sentenced for two or more felonies, and pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-662(4)(a). Thus, his extended term sentence was not unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the failure of &sect; 291C-13 to define the phrase &quot;scene of the accident&quot; rendered the statute unconstitutionally vague and that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. The court concluded that the phrase &quot;scene of the accident&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct. The plain and ordinary meaning of the phrase &quot;scene of the accident&quot; was the place or location where the accident occurred. By his own admission, defendant drove from where the accident occurred to a convenience store parking lot and then &quot;looked back at the scene.&quot; This was sufficient to show that defendant did not stop at the scene of the accident. In addition to the testimony of the other driver, defendant's own testimony showed that he did not go back to the location of the accident and that he did not provide the required information to the other driver. There was sufficient evidence that defendant violated &sect; 291C-13 with the requisite mens rea.</SPAN></P>

The inmate had received a certificate of final discharge (CFD) for the two predicate felonies that were used to sentence the inmate as a repeat offender and contended in his petition under Haw. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped defendant after hearing her come to a screeching halt behind stopped traffic. After the officer observed signs of intoxication and defendant failed field sobriety tests, she was arrested. The case was continued due to the State's inability to secure the officer as a witness on the first trial date. After defendant's motion to suppress evidence was denied, she was convicted. Thereafter, she filed an appeal. On review, the court held that the motion to suppress was properly denied. The officer properly conducted an investigatory stop because the officer thought defendant was speeding and driving recklessly. Moreover, it appeared that she was about to collide with other vehicles. As such, the officer had specific and articulable facts to support the stop. However, the court was required to reverse the trial court's oral order regarding the denial of the motion to dismiss based on Haw. R. Penal P. 48 because the findings of fact were not stated on the record, as required by Haw. R. Penal P. 12(e) (1997). The court was unable to evaluate if defendant's motion to suppress delayed the start of the trial or whether the State's continuance was an excludable time period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint filed against defendant charged him with several motor vehicle offenses. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, claiming his acts of political protests were protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Circuit Court of the Third Circuit, Hawai'i, denied his motion and the jury found him guilty. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his criminal prosecution for motor vehicle offenses was a gross violation of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. Defendant also contended that the trial court violated his due process and Sixth Amendment rights to compulsory process to present a favorable defense witness when it ordered a witness to wear western clothing when testifying, thus precluding the witness from wearing only a malo and a kihei. The appellate court rejected his claims. The State of Hawai'i was a lawful government and defendant was not exempt from the laws of the State of Hawai'i, including its traffic laws. The trial court had discretion to decide what a witness could wear. The error, if any, in requiring a witness to wear western garb was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury saw how the witness was dressed and was fully informed of the reasons why the witness was dressed as he was dressed and how the witness would have been dressed if he had a choice.</SPAN></P>

The trial court erred when the court gave its choice of evils instruction because the evidence did not support a choice of evils instruction. First, assuming defendant reasonably believed that his actions were necessary to avoid an imminent harm or evil to him or to another, the harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct was not greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii), which convicted him of two counts of making a terroristic threat against a public servant, in violation of Haw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the definition of &quot;public servant&quot; found in Haw.

Stat. &sect; 707-716(1)(c) to terroristic threats made against a public servant who was actively performing a governmental function at the time the threat was made. Defendant also challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 707-716(1)(c) on vagueness grounds. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The court rejected defendant's interpretation of the phrase &quot;in performing a governmental function&quot; in Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 710-1000(15) and interpreted it as qualifying a person as a public servant based on the type of work he or she performed and not based on when that work was being performed. The court held that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-716(1)(c) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's threats, because &sect; 707-716(1)(c) gave defendant fair notice that his conduct was prohibited. The court held that there was no doubt that defendant's threats were &quot;true threats,&quot; and any error in failing to give a &quot;true threat&quot; instruction was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the doctor contended his constitutional rights were violated, as one of the decisionmakers relied on by the board was personally financially interested in his decision against the doctor. The appellate court disagreed, as the doctor's appeal to the board was a de novo proceeding and nothing in the record indicated the board relied upon the recommendations the advisory panel made to the director. The doctor made no detectable argument to support his assertion that the workers' compensation medical fee schedule constituted a taking of his property without due process. As the written complaint in this case specifically alleged that more than 100 violations of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386-27 (1993) occurred within two years of the date of the complaint, the doctor's complaint that violations were miscalculated under the statute was without merit. The appellate court concluded that the board's grant of summary disposition was proper.</SPAN></P>

He filed a motion for correction of illegal sentence pursuant to Haw. R. Penal P. 35 that the circuit court denied. The court affirmed, stating that, because the circuit court addressed the merits of defendant's third R. 35 motion, notwithstanding its conclusion that the motion was barred by res judicata, the court found it unnecessary to address the correctness of defendant's interpretation of the former R. 35. The indictment charged defendant with intentionally or knowingly causing the death of the victim, a person known by defendant to be a witness in a murder prosecution. The indictment therefore clearly alleged the fact that subjected defendant to an enhanced sentence for murder, namely, knowledge that the victim was a witness in a murder prosecution, and, as defendant was found guilty of murder by a jury, his Apprendi argument was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by terminating her parental rights because it erroneously found that the mother would not become able, in a reasonable amount of time, to provide the children with a safe family home, even with the assistance of a service plan, when at the same time the trial court found that the mother could provide a safe family home for the older children. The court of appeals disagreed. The number of the children's siblings and the negative impact that number of siblings had on the ability of the mother to provide the children with a safe family home within that period of time was not a valid reason for extending that period of time. As a result of psychiatric, psychological, and developmental evaluations, the trial court found that the six older children were bonded with the mother and separation from her would cause them harm. In contrast, the other children were not bonded with the mother. Psychiatric evaluations of them indicated that their contact with their family triggered sexual acting out behavior and would cause irreparable damage to them.

However, the testimony of the police officers and defendant was that defendant was cited near the beach, in an area that was not fenced or enclosed, and which had no posted signs warning the public to keep out of the area.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued that the trial court erred in committing her because she was not imminently dangerous to self or others. The court of appeals agreed. To be considered &quot;dangerous to self,&quot; it was not enough that an individual was unable to satisfy the need for nourishment, essential medical care, shelter or self-protection without supervision and assistance of others. While there was evidence that the patient's refusal to take her medications would result in her failure to get better, there was no evidence presented that she would probably die or suffer substantial bodily injury, serious physical debilitation, or serious disease if she were not involuntarily hospitalized. While the evidence indicated that the patient's inappropriate remarks upset other patients and embarrassed her family in public, there was no evidence that any member of the public had ever retaliated or threatened to retaliate against the patient for her remarks. Therefore, the trial court erred by committing the patient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was injured when he crashed his motorcycle, opposed and refused to have a blood test, as he particularly was averse to needles.

The matter was controlled by a decision of the Supreme Court of Hawai'i, a case involving similar facts and the same judge. The Supreme Court ruled that the district court erred in ruling that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 286-163 (Supp. 2000) (repealed) was inapplicable on the basis that the driver was the only person injured as a result of the accident in which he was involved. Section 286-163 applied to drivers injured or killed in a single-vehicle collision in which no other person was injured. Moreover, it was not necessary for the police to comply with the prerequisites of Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 286-151 (Supp. 2000) (repealed) in order to obtain breath, blood, or urine samples pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 286-163 (Supp. 2000) (repealed).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawaii), challenging his conviction and sentence for promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 712-1243 (1993 &amp; Supp. 2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of a drug crime. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in admitting a packet of methamphetamine into evidence, as the state failed to establish a sufficient chain of custody. Defendant argued that the inconsistency in the evidence concerned which police officers had custody of the packet after it was picked up by a recruit. However, the argument did not support a tampering claim, as it failed to sufficiently establish reasonable certainty that tampering took place where there was no evidence suggesting impropriety, motive to tamper, or false reporting on the part of the officers who had possession of the packet. Defendant then argued that the trial court erred in denying his request for a change of appointed counsel and violated his right to counsel. However, the record established that the trial court engaged in a lengthy discussion with defendant about what was required to substitute new counsel and explained the possible pleas, the charges, possible sentences, the burden of proof, possible defenses, the difficulties associated with representing oneself, and the fact that he could retain his own counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with burglary, robbery, and kidnapping after he broke into the victim's apartment and held her against her will until she managed to escape when he went upstairs to retrieve the items he wanted to steal. He was convicted and sentenced, but this judgment was vacated and his guilty pleas were withdrawn because defendant was not properly advised at sentencing. After a trial, defendant was again convicted and sentenced to a harsher term than the first sentence. The court affirmed the conviction but vacated and remanded the sentence. The Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 707-720 defense imposed upon the State the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not release the victim alive, prior to trial, voluntarily, not suffering from injury, or in a safe place. The failure of the instruction to connect &quot;release&quot; and &quot;prior to trial&quot; was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the State proved that this was not the case. Because defendant's earlier collateral attack on the first judgment resulted in the trial court vacating it, Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 706-609 precluded a subsequent sentence that was harsher than the sentence originally imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but vacated and remanded the sentence part of the judgment for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In one of two cases consolidated on appeal, respondent, a police department, appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Hawai'i) ordering the department to return a truck it had impounded from movants, the purported owners. In the other case, movant, another purported owner, appealed the circuit court's denial of a motion for reconsideration of its order denying the return to him of two trucks impounded by the department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the department seized a truck, which was ostensibly owned by and registered to the purported owners, and impounded it. After about 16 months had passed, the purported owners filed a Haw. R. Penal P. 41(e) motion for return of the truck. The circuit court, in its order returning the truck to the purported owners, did not determine whether the truck was contraband under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 286-44(a). On appeal, the department challenged the circuit court's failure to make this determination. The appellate court concluded that, in light of the substantial evidence before the circuit court indicating that the truck was stolen, it was incumbent upon the circuit court to entertain and determine whether the truck was, indeed, contraband, particularly after intervenor, the true putative owner, intervened in the action. In ordering the truck returned to the purported owners without making that determination, the circuit court proceeded without deciding real and salient questions about the legality of returning the truck to the purported owners, the opposing ownership rights of the putative owner, and the department's statutory duties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first case, the appellate court vacated the circuit court's judgment, and remanded for further proceedings. In the second case, the appellate court affirmed the circuit court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed a quiet title action against the individual. The individual contended that he acquired the land from his great, great grandfather. After the circuit court granted the corporation's motion for summary judgment, the individual sought review. In affirming, the court noted that the individual's brief did not comply with Haw. R. App. P. 28(b). However, the court considered the brief, as the individual was appearing pro se. The corporation had paper title to the subject property that was superior to the individual's claim. Moreover, the evidence showed that the corporation's grantor acquired the land through adverse possession. The corporation and its predecessors-in-interest occupied the land adversely for more than 60 years. The court found that title awarded by a royal patent were not vested for perpetuity. Further, the land could have been conveyed, as it was acquired through a valid land commission award. The court rejected the individual's arguments concerning jurisdiction and constitutionality. Finally, the court held that the individual was not entitled to recover costs and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed however, stating that the evidence was sufficient that she knowingly possessed more than one ounce of methamphetamine because the record contained substantial evidence that defendant knowingly possessed the total amount of the substance containing methamphetamine contained in the State's exhibits, which was more than one ounce. Further, there was not an insufficient nexus between herself and the drugs found in the bedroom because defendant was an occupant of the bedroom, and was within a few feet from the table on which the substance and paraphernalia were located. The trial court did not erroneously admit correspondence in violation of her right to a fair trial, as the correspondence was probative of whether a nexus existed between defendant and the substance.</SPAN></P>

Before the State filed an answer to the petition, the trial court dismissed the petition on the basis that it was patently frivolous and without a trace of support in the record or that, pursuant to Haw. R. Penal P. 40(a)(3), the issues asserted therein had been waived. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by dismissing the petition because prison officials had offered perjured testimony, he was not allowed access to legal help, and he was denied his mental health medication. The court of appeals found that defendant presented complaints and raised issues he raised or could have raised in prior proceedings and appeals. It appeared that he sought to add to and improve upon some of his previous arguments. The petition was patently frivolous and without a trace of support in the record and, pursuant to Rule 40(a)(3), the issues asserted therein had been waived, in addition the issues asserted in the petition had been previously ruled upon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of failure to disperse following a 21st birthday party for defendant's son at which approximately 500 people assembled. Defendant claimed that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 711-1102 was unconstitutionally vague. Section 711-1102 concerned a person in the immediate vicinity of six or more persons participating in a course of disorderly conduct likely to cause substantial harm or serious inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm. The court analyzed the statute and compared similar statutes and cases in other jurisdictions and concluded that the citizens of the instant state would have no difficulty in understanding &sect; 711-1102. The statute was clearly violated when people, including defendant, failed to comply with a law enforcement order to disperse. Because &sect; 711-1102 was as clear as the comparison criminal statute upheld by the United States Supreme Court and because the state supreme court had adopted federal constitutional law in void for vagueness challenges to criminal statutes, the instant court held that &sect; 711-1102 was not unconstitutionally vague under either the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the district court's order, which ordered that defendant was adjudged guilty of failure to disperse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) insufficient evidence supported the finding that he violated the protective order by failing to complete a domestic abuse program; (2) the family court erred in permitting the State to amend the charge in the original complaint; and (3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to focus on the absence of the rules governing the domestic abuse program. The appellate court rejected the arguments. Substantial credible evidence established that defendant intentionally or knowingly left the abuse program interview after 15 minutes and failed to complete the program, thus violating the order. Defendant's argument regarding the amended charge was rejected because the amended complaint charged defendant with violating the same offense as the original complaint. Finally, defendant failed to meet his burden of showing specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence when counsel moved the family court for a judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Second Circuit Court, Hawai'i, convicted defendant, upon a jury's verdict, of the offense of place to keep firearm, in violation of Haw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that: (1) the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his pretrial motion to withdraw and substitute counsel; (2) the trial court erred when it admitted all of the evidence obtained from a police officer's search of defendant's lost fanny pack, which had been found on the premises of a hotel; and (3) his public defender rendered ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to file a motion to suppress evidence of items of identification recovered during the officer's inventory of the fanny pack. The instant court concluded that there was no good cause to warrant substitution of counsel. Defendant wanted the public defender to proffer character evidence and character witnesses on defendant's behalf at trial, and the public defender felt, correctly, that he could not. The public defender rendered a complete and adequate defense on behalf of defendant. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence of items of identification recovered during the officer's inventory of the fanny pack. The inventory revealed no more than what private parties had already discovered. Defendant did not meet his burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees of the bar noticed that an individual was under the influence of alcohol based on his erratic behavior at the time they served him while he was in the bar.

The appellate court affirmed and found that sufficient evidence existed to find that the bar had violated the statute. Additionally, the appellate court held that Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 281-1 (1993) was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness in defining the term &quot;under the influence of alcohol&quot; as the statute accounted for differences in intoxication from person to person by focusing on the proscribed result and provided objective indicators to evaluate possible impairment.

The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant had been given Miranda warnings during his two previous encounters with the police. Moreover, the colloquy between defendant and an officer at the beginning of the interview revealed defendant's familiarity with the warnings. It was defendant, not the officer, who first mentioned the Miranda warnings by name. Defendant's initial questions about whether an attorney would be obtained &quot;right now&quot; did not constitute an unequivocal and unambiguous invocation of his right to counsel. Defendant's following questions made it clear that what he was concerned about was the precise moment an attorney could be made available to him. Most importantly, the officer made it clear to defendant that, if he requested an attorney, further police interrogation would cease, no matter when the attorney would ultimately arrive. Apparently satisfied with that response, defendant unequivocally and unambiguously stated that he did not want an attorney &quot;now.&quot; Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, through the district attorney, recommended that defendant be sentenced to two years and four months and one year and eight months on the promoting a dangerous drug charges, and two years four months on the second degree robbery charge. The Hawai'i Paroling Authority (HPA) recommended that defendant's minimum sentence should be set at four years in each of the three cases. The appellate court noted that while the district attorney represented the prosecutor representing the State and the prosecutor was bound by the plea agreement, the district attorney did not represent the trial court or the State HPA. While the trial court could have bound itself to the plea agreement between the State and defendant, it did not do so. Nothing in Haw. R. Penal P. 11 required the court to be bound to the agreement. Thus, the sentence imposed was not illegal. The appellate court did not address defendant's statutory challenge as it was not authorized by a Haw. R. Penal P. 40 proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of two counts of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree, and one count of unlawful use of drug paraphernalia. Defendant appealed the convictions and alleged the First Circuit Court (Hawai'i) erred by consolidating the drug promotion charges with the drug paraphernalia charges and by denying his motions to suppress evidence seized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A friend of defendant's was renting a hotel room. When a security guard at the hotel noticed an unregistered guest going to the friend's hotel room, the guard advised the friend that she could not have unregistered guests in her hotel room. The guard went with the friend to evict the unregistered guests. When the door was opened, defendant was observed sitting on the bed holding a glass pipe and a propane torch. The security guard told defendant that the police were being contacted as defendant did not produce any identification. While waiting for the police, the security guard found a glass pipe and some plastic bags containing a white substance. The glass pipe contained .03 milligrams of residue containing cocaine. The appellate court held that the consolidation of the two charges did not violate any constitutional rights as the pipe was the basis for the paraphernalia charge. The search of the room was not unreasonable as the security guard was not an agent of the State.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded the family court erred in refusing to set aside the paternity judgment. The mother's oral statement that putative father was daughter's biological father was sufficient evidence, in and of itself, to establish putative father's paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the grandmother's motion was vacated, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The personal injury victim walked to the middle of the road, leaned over to pick up a quarter, and was struck by a motor vehicle.

The matter was tried. The driver unsuccessfully moved for a directed verdict. The injured party was awarded damages. The trial court sanctioned the driver for failure to settle. The driver successfully raised several contentions on appeal. The appellate court reversed a sanction order imposed upon the driver under Haw. R. Cir. Ct. 12.1 for failing to make a monetary settlement offer. Under the general rule, a court could not force settlements upon parties. The appellate court also reversed the denial of the driver's request for a directed verdict premised on the sanctions order.</SPAN></P>

The court ran the prison terms on counts one and two consecutively, but concurrently with the other prison terms, for a maximum term of imprisonment of thirty years. On appeal, defendant asserted that because the court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence -- a sawed-off shotgun -- recovered by the police during a warrantless search of his bedroom in his parents's house, his convictions on all five counts were subject to reversal. The appellate court agreed. Neither consent nor exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry and search of defendant's bedroom, the sawed-off shotgun should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled no contest to manslaughter as part of a plea agreement involving extradition. The other state dismissed charges. Then the parties agreed that he would be sentenced to a 10-year prison term, but that once courtesy supervision was set up with Minnesota, his sentence would be amended to 5-years probation there. The State moved to revoke probation. The Third Circuit Court (Hawaii) denied his motion to withdraw his plea. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to withdraw his plea while still jailed in Hawaii. Hearing on the motion was continued in anticipation of completion of the arrangements to send him to Minnesota to serve probation. Defendant moved to enforce the sentencing agreement. Because Minnesota would not accept him for courtesy supervision until he was actually placed on probation, the trial court sentenced him to long-distance probation with Hawaii authorities until Minnesota courtesy supervision could be arranged. Defendant acknowledged that the granting of his motion for probation meant that he would not be able to withdraw his no contest plea. In Minnesota, defendant was convicted of a drug offense. Hawaii moved for probation revocation. The appellate court held that defendant did not timely appeal from the final judgment in his case. His motion to withdraw his plea did not reopen the final judgment. Because determination of revocation was still pending and his rights to his plea could be fully vindicated in an appeal of a decision on revocation, the denial of his motion to withdraw was neither a final order nor within the collateral order exception to the final order rule, unlike in federal courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and a co-defendant were observed exchanging what appeared to be a rock of crack cocaine. Appellant was pursued into a convenience store, where he discarded a fanny pack. He denied that the pack was his. His motion to suppress evidence found in the fanny pack was denied. The search did not violate appellant's rights. The requisite level of abandonment occurred to support the trial court's decision that appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the fanny pack. Appellant's contention that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to dismiss a juror for cause was rejected. There existed no evidence of manifest prejudice on the part of the juror. While defense counsel's initial concerns may have been justified, the subsequent discussion between the juror and both defense counsel and the court produced no indication that the juror could not be impartial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Conclusion of abandonment was correct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions of and sentences for promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree and driving without a license. Defendant contended that the arresting officer's actions in following his car, speeding up to get behind his car, and radioing to check about an expired safety sticker on his car amounted to an unlawful search and seizure in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV. Defendant also contended that the pre-incarceration search of him was unconstitutional. The appellate court vacated the mandatory minimum sentence of one year imposed for the offense of driving without a license and otherwise affirmed. The challenged actions of the arresting officer all constituted lawful acts and, viewed separately or together, were not a search or a seizure. The pre-incarceration search of defendant was also legally conducted, as the rule applicable to inventory searches, which disallowed the investigation of the contents of a closed container, was not violated. However, the offense of driving without a license was not a felony, and it therefore did not qualify for the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence on a repeat offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court found appellant guilty of harassment for knocking a police officer's hat off.  Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 711-1106(1)(a) prohibited acts which subject another person to offensive physical contact. The conduct at issue was covered by &sect; 711-1106(1)(a). The State presented sufficient evidence to prove that appellant intended to harass, annoy, or alarm the officer when he knocked his hat off. The challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence failed. However, by using the word &quot;reckless&quot; to describe appellant's conduct, the district court failed to heed the express mens rea requirement of &sect; 711-1106(1)(a) -- the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person. The ruling clearly indicated an erroneous understanding of the requisite mens rea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, contending that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained from an allegedly illegal stop of his vehicle. Finding that the stop was constitutionally permissible, the appellate court affirmed. An investigative stop of a vehicle conducted by a police officer constituted an exception to the U.S. Const. amend. IV warrant requirement if the stopping offer could point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, warranted the officer's suspicion that criminal activity could be afoot. Because the stopping officer had followed behind defendant and sped his vehicle to its maximum speed of approximately 47 miles per hour, the facts would have led a reasonable officer to believe that defendant was exceeding the 35 mile per hour speed limit. The stopping officer's belief that a speeding citation would not &quot;stand up in court&quot; had no bearing on the determination of the applicability of the investigative stop exception.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment convicting him of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, asserting the court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained from an illegal stop. The court reversed the holding and vacated his conviction, reasoning that the officer was not justified in stopping appellant due to the lack of sufficiently corroborating evidence of an immediate, urgent, or clear public danger. The officer did not partake in any further observations that might have verified the anonymous informer's information. That is, he did not testify that his observations of the appellant confirmed that he was &quot;bleeding all over the place&quot;, as the anonymous caller had reported. Moreover, absent any evidence that would lead the officer to reasonably suspect that criminal activity was afoot, the investigative stop was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with burglary and harassment by stalking. At trial, the State qualified a detective as an expert witness on stalkers and she testified that stalking suspects typically took trophies from their victims. Appellant sought to suppress her testimony, but the trial court found the detective was qualified to opine on such matters. Appellant then challenged a ruling on a search warrant whereby the trial court held another officer independently possessed the level of suspicion necessary to obtain a warrant, even though the officer admitted in preparing the warrant that she had seen evidence which was the fruit of an invalid, nonconsensual search. Appellant was convicted, and challenged the verdict. The court held the determination of whether a witness was qualified as an expert in a particular field was largely within the discretion of the trial court and, as such, would not be upset absent a clear abuse of discretion. The court affirmed, holding the trial court did not abuse its discretion in qualifying the State's expert witness, and that the search warrant properly fell within the independent source exception.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion by qualifying the State's expert on issues of stalkers; therefore, appellant's motion to suppress her statements was properly denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with attempted cruelty to animals. A witness testified that he observed appellant spraying cat food, which had been left out for feral cats, with an aerosol substance. An animal control officer testified that appellant admitted to her that he sprayed the food because he was sick of the feral cats in the area. The trial court found appellant guilty. The court reversed, holding that while the statute prohibiting cruelty to animals was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, appellant was not guilty based on the fact found by the trial court that no cats actually ate the poisoned food. The trial court believed appellant's testimony and expressly found that appellant intended to spray the food only so that the cats would not eat it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from (1) the grant by the Circuit Court, Second Circuit (Hawai'i) of a deficiency judgment to plaintiff and (2) its denial of their motion for relief under Haw. R. Civ. P. 60(b) from the foreclosure judgment and all orders ancillary to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a mother and son, defaulted on a mortgage; plaintiff mortgagor filed a complaint for foreclosure. The trial court granted plaintiff summary judgement and a decree of foreclosure; defendants did not appeal. After the foreclosure sale, plaintiff got a writ of possession; defendant did not appeal. They did appeal the deficiency judgment that later entered, and filed a 60(b) motion for relief from all previous judgments; their second appeal was from denial of this motion. The first appeal was dismissed as untimely, as it raised issues of the foreclosure judgment's validity, not the amount of the deficiency, and the foreclosure judgment had been final over a year when it was appealed. As to the second appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling that defendants were not entitled to relief under Rule 60. Service on defendant mother with defendant son's copy of the process was proper. Relief for fraudulent inducement to enter into the contract was unavailable under Rule 60(b); ignorance of the law did not equal excusable neglect; defendants failed properly to argue and brief claims of statutory disclosure violations and unconstitutionality of the foreclosure law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because the first appeal was untimely filed, and the second was dismissed since defendants showed no basis for relief under Haw. R. Civ. P. 60(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a probation violation, the trial court sentenced appellant to 10 years with credit for time served. Appellant filed a petition under Haw. R.

The trial court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing. The court vacated and remanded, because it was not apparent from the record whether appellant was ever advised by counsel of his right to testify and of the pros and cons of testifying. A hearing should have been conducted, and appellant's counsel should have been given the opportunity to explain his reasons for not calling appellant as a witness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant, a police officer, was charged with third-degree assault arising out of an off-duty occurrence. His employer, the County of Hawaii, was made party to a related civil suit. Pursuant to statute, the County of Hawaii, advertised and negotiated with attorneys to provide legal services for appellant. However, the county intended to pursue a defense that appellant was not acting under the color of lawful authority or representing it during the alleged assault. Nevertheless, the county selected and paid for appellant's defense counsel without fully consulting appellant. A jury convicted him. He appealed. The court vacated the trial court's findings and conclusions. It also reversed the order denying his post-conviction relief petition. The court held appellant had not consented to representation selected and paid for by the county, which had a conflict of interest; thus it was up to appellant to seek and obtain alternative representation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Findings and conclusions vacated, order denying post-conviction relief petition reversed, new trial ordered, and cause remanded because conflict of interest occurred when County of Hawaii employer of criminal appellant, a police officer, selected and paid for his defense counsel and appellant did not consent to that relationship after full consultation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant challenged the judgment of the First Circuit Court (Hawaii), which dismissed his appeal from the denial of parole by the appellee parole board on jurisdictional grounds, pursuant to Haw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant challenged the judgment of the circuit court, which dismissed his appeal from the denial of parole by the appellee parole board on jurisdictional grounds. The court held that a prison parole hearing was not a contested case hearing subject to judicial review. Accordingly, defendant was not entitled to appeal under Haw. Rev. Stat. &sect; 91-14 (1993) from the denial by appellee Hawaii Paroling Authority of his parole request. However, The court also held that the requirement imposed as part of the Hawaii Sex Offender Treatment Program that a &quot;sex offender&quot; inmate admit to commission of a sexual assault and complete a mandatory treatment program as a precondition to parole implicated a liberty interest under Haw. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. The court held that defendant's contention that he had been subjected to such a requirement, but was not a sex offender, raised a colorable claim that his continued prison confinement was illegal. Such a claim was entitled to be heard under Haw. R. Penal P. 40, which incorporated inter alia remedies afforded by the writ of habeas corpus. Thus, case was remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment which dismissed appeal on jurisdictional grounds affirmed. Although prison parole hearing was not contested hearing subject to judicial review, subjection of non-adjudicated sex offender to mandatory treatment program as precondition for parole eligibility required due process protections. Thus, matter remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer investigated a report of a male with a knife chasing another male.

The officer conducted an investigatory stop, during which appellant was not cooperative. The officer handcuffed and patted down appellant. The officer did not find a knife. Eventually, the handcuffs were removed. When appellant took his hand out of his right pocket, one of the officers saw plastic bags of drugs. Appellant was then arrested. Prior to trial, appellant moved to suppress the drugs. The motion was denied. Appellant was convicted of promoting a dangerous drug. The conviction was vacated because the trial court erred by denying appellant's motion to suppress. The further detention and interrogation of appellant was unlawful, and any evidence seized as a result should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

The court believed the evidence was relevant and should have been admitted under the general rules of evidence.
