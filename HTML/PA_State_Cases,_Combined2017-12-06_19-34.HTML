<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County (Pennsylvania) granted the Commonwealth's motion for reconsideration after defendant was sentenced to one to two years of electronic monitoring. It then found that 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7508, under which defendant was sentenced for his conviction of felony delivery of a controlled substance, set forth a mandatory minimum sentence of one year in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of delivery of a controlled substance, in violation of 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 780-113, which was a felony. The substance was 4.8 grams of cocaine. The trial court initially sentenced defendant to one to two years' electronic monitoring, but subsequently granted the Commonwealth's motion for reconsideration, which claimed that 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7508 set forth a mandatory minimum sentence of one year in prison for felony delivery under 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 780-113(a)(30). Defendant argued on appeal that the trial court erred when it modified his first sentence because, inter alia, application of the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional under Booker. The appellate court disagreed and found that the trial court did not err in finding that 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7508 required at least one year in prison. The appellate court so concluded because it found that the 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7508 did not violate Apprendi, Blakely, Booker, or defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. The statute dealt with mandatory minimum sentences and not the constitutional problem of a trial court increasing a sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on facts not submitted to a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), following his plea of guilty to robbery, aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person, and possession of instruments of a crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that defendant received a 25 to 50-year mandatory sentence for robbery as a &quot;third strike,&quot; and then another 25 to 50-year sentence enhancement for aggravated assault as a &quot;fourth strike.&quot; Both charges arose from the same incident, and defendant was convicted and sentenced for both on the same dates. Applying the sentence enhancement for both robbery and aggravated assault was in error. The sentence for aggravated assault was vacated. It did not matter that defendant's sentences were concurrent. Defendant had to be sentenced for a &quot;third strike&quot; and given the opportunity to reform before he could be convicted and sentenced for a &quot;fourth strike.&quot; Since defendant's sentences were concurrent, the overall sentencing scheme was not compromised, and it was not necessary to remand for re-sentencing. Finally, defendant's 2001 robbery conviction counted for purposes of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9714(g), even though it was in federal, rather than state, court. Section 9714(a)(2) was unambiguous. Proof that defendant received notice of the penalties under &sect; 9714(a)(1) was not required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was vacated insofar as it related to the aggravated assault conviction, and was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) convicted defendant, a member of the state legislature, of conflict of interest under 65 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1103(a). It acquitted him of theft of services under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3926(b). Defendant appealed from the judgment of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the conflict of interest charge should have been dismissed under 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1933 because 65 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1103 was a general statute and the theft of services statute was a specific one. The court stated that although both statutes prohibited the wrongful diversion of services for pecuniary gain, &sect; 1103 was limited to public officials acting through the authority of their offices. Thus, defendant was convicted under the more specific provision. Next, the evidence supported the conviction. It demonstrated that defendant in his official capacity directed several state employees to conduct political work, such as fund-raising efforts, for him at times when the employees were being paid by taxpayers to perform work for constituents. Defendant derived the benefit of a substantial number of hours of labor for which he otherwise would have needed to pay. Section 1103 was not vague under the state or federal constitutions on its face or as applied to defendant. There was nothing unclear about the concept of using the authority of an office to obtain private pecuniary benefit. Finally, the statute was not overbroad. Nothing in it reached protected behavior.</SPAN></P>

Before BLACKWELL, J.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial in the York County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania), defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) under 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802. He appealed, arguing that &sect; 3802(c) violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 because it was vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had rejected a claim that &sect; 3802(a)(2) was unconstitutionally vague because it was unclear when the crime occurred. The supreme court had emphasized that &sect; 3802 proscribed the act of driving after drinking a sufficient amount of alcohol, where a sufficient amount of alcohol was that quantity that would cause a person's blood alcohol content (BAC) level to reach the statutorily prohibited range within two hours after driving, regardless of the actor's BAC level at the actual time of driving. Although &sect; 3802(a)(2) applied to BAC between 0.08 and 0.10 percent within two hours after driving, and &sect; 3802(c) referred to BAC of 0.16 percent or higher, the language of the subsections was otherwise the same. Accordingly, &sect; 3802(c) was not unconstitutionally vague because it did not specify that a person's BAC be above 0.16 percent at the time he was driving and because it did not specify when a person could resume driving. The prohibited conduct was drinking excessively and then driving. Next, the supreme court had specifically held that &sect; 3802(c) was not overbroad; thus, this claim failed too.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner sought review of an order entered in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) which dismissed his petition brought pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546. The issue was whether the prisoner timely filed his current PCRA petition, and if not whether there was an exception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner filed his first PCRA petition and the PCRA court appointed counsel. Counsel filed a &quot;no-merit&quot; letter. The PCRA court granted counsel permission to withdraw. It subsequently dismissed the petition pursuant Pa. R. Crim. P. 907. The prisoner filed his current PCRA petition over five years after his judgment of sentence became final. Thus, his current petition was untimely. Nevertheless, the prisoner sought to invoke the exception to the PCRA time bar under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9545(b)(1)(ii). The prisoner insisted that he could not have reasonably known within the time allotted following direct review that the law barred the coroner from signing his arrest warrant. The appellate court held the prisoner bore the burden of proving why he did not file a timely PCRA petition. His warrant was a matter of public record and was accessible to him. Although he asserted he could not have known of his claim until later, he could have reasonably discovered the coroner's signature on the warrant long before he filed his PCRA petition. His claim did not qualify as an exception to the PCRA timeliness requirements and PCRA counsel could not be deemed ineffective for having failed to pursue it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of multiple counts of corruption of a minor and indecent assault (18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 6301 and 3126, respectively. The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), denied his postconviction motions but granted the Commonwealth's motion to increase his sentence. After remand, it re-sentenced defendant to an aggregate prison term of three to six years, plus five years' probation. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged the trial court vindictively increased his sentence because he filed post-sentence motions. The appellate court held that this claim was waived because it implicated the discretionary aspects of the sentence, not its legality; it was not included in his Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) statement; and the Commonwealth objected. It disapproved Commonwealth v. Walker, 568 A.2d 201 (Pa. Super. 1989); Commonwealth v. Maly, 558 A.2d 877 (Pa. Super. 1989); Commonwealth v. Mikesell, 537 A.2d 1372 (Pa. Super. 1988); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 860 A.2d 146 (Pa. Super. 2004); and Commonwealth v. McHale, 2007 PA Super. 131, to the extent that they suggested a claim of vindictiveness was a non-waivable challenge to a sentence's legality. Though the trial court improperly warned defendant not to file a motion for sentence reconsideration, there was no indication it acted vindictively. As fondling the victim's breast was corruption of a minor, and touching her vagina was the separate crime of indecent assault, the two crimes did not merge. The trial court should have given reasons for sentencing defendant outside of the guidelines, but it articulated adequate reasons for the sentence as a whole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, upon a guilty plea, of interception, disclosure or use of wire, electronic, or oral communications, and harassment. Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County (Pennsylvania) following the revocation of defendant's probation. Defendant furnished a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal. The trial court submitted its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence that he had violated a probation condition. The appellate court held that defendant admitted to a polygraph examiner and a probation officer that he had twice watched X-rated movies. The fact that defendant masturbated to one of the movies and destroyed it further supported the conclusion that the movies depicted prohibited sexual conduct. The condition's restriction on viewing or possessing nude depictions was neither vague nor overbroad. It did not impose a ban against &quot;mere nudity&quot; as found in works of serious art. The condition incorporated the nudity restriction within the larger prohibition against possessing obscene materials, or materials which depicted sexual conduct. The generally accepted meaning of the terms &quot;obscene,&quot; or &quot;sexual conduct&quot; could be found by referring to 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5903(b). The condition's terms were specific and well-recognized in the context of law enforcement against sex offenses, did not sweep overbroadly into constitutionally protected conduct, only applied to probationers, and directly related to a legitimate interest in reducing the recidivism of sex offender probationers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dog owner brought suit against defendant animal welfare organization after it euthanized her dogs. A jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) found in favor of plaintiff on her conversion, negligence, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. It awarded compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion for counsel fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. Defendant appealed. Plaintiff cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's dogs were removed from her home and plaintiff charged with dog-fighting. After the charges were dropped, plaintiff was mistakenly told that the dogs had been euthanized. They were actually euthanized several days later. The court rejected defendant's argument that the conversion and negligence claims were barred by sovereign immunity and by 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8541. Defendant was a private corporation, not a Commonwealth agency under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 8501 and 102. It elected its own directors and officers, and the Commonwealth did not control its operations. There was sufficient evidence to support the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. A jury could find the killing of the dogs to be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. As for due process, plaintiff had a property interest in her dogs, and there was sufficient evidence that defendant had inadequate procedures in place to safeguard that interest. Defendant's conduct did not support the punitive damages award. There was no evidence that it acted in conscious disregard of a risk of harm to plaintiff. Finally, plaintiff was entitled to counsel fees, as she had established a constitutional violation and received compensatory damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the award of punitive damages and the denial of counsel fees. It affirmed the rest of the judgment. It remanded the case for entry of judgment on compensatory damages and counsel fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence by the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County (Pennsylvania). Defendant's attorney filed a petition to withdraw as counsel alleging that the appeal was frivolous. Counsel also filed a brief pursuant to Anders presenting issues that might arguably support the appeal, which included whether the trial court erred by imposing a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9714(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to burglary. The crime occurred in a home while a person was present, making the offense a crime of violence under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9714(g). In an earlier case, defendant was convicted of a burglary that also qualified as a crime of violence. As such, the trial court sentenced him under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9714(a) which imposed a mandatory minimum term of not less than ten nor more than twenty years for the subject burglary. The petition averred that counsel reviewed the record and relevant legal authority and indicated counsel's conclusion that there were no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal. The petition specifically stated that, following counsel's review, he believed the appeal was wholly frivolous. The appellate court held counsel had met the three requirements of Anders. Because the burglary was a crime of violence, the second strike penalty applied to defendant. The trial court imposed the mandatory second strike sentence as required by law. Accordingly, that issue was frivolous. His claim that he did not know of the mandatory sentence at the time of the plea was frivolous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, three juveniles, in consolidated appeals from the Court of Common Pleas of York County (Pennsylvania), challenged the validity of the DNA Act, 44 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2316. Each juvenile had been ordered to submit a DNA sample and each had filed a motion to quash, which had been denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juveniles argued that the trial court's application of the Act retroactively appended a condition on fully-served dispositions. Two had been discharged from formal probation pursuant to felony adjudications prior to the effective date of the most recent Act amendment. The third, though, was still subject to a dispositional order entered pursuant to his felony adjudication. In each case, the trial court ordered DNA sampling pursuant to later misdemeanor and summary offenses. One juvenile was no longer under supervision, however, for his prior felony adjudication; the only reason that he was confined was his subsequent misdemeanor adjudications. Thus, the Act did not apply to him. On the other hand, the third juvenile remained under supervision for his felony adjudications until after the amendment, and so he was properly ordered to provide a sample. As to the second, though the Commonwealth contended that he was not &quot;technically&quot; subject to the Act as his supervision for a felony adjudication ended five days before the amendment, and that he should not benefit, such was jurisdictional. In addition, the Act was neither vague nor did it facilitate unreasonable search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court held that two of the juveniles were not subject to the dictates of the DNA Act, and it, therefore, reversed the orders directing them to submit to DNA sampling. In contrast, it concluded that the third juvenile was subject to the provisions of the DNA Act. Furthermore, the DNA Act was not void due to vagueness, nor did it violate the third juvenile's right to privacy or right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas, Berks County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), imposed following his convictions of possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, in violation of 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 780-113(a)(16), (30). Specifically, defendant was sentenced to five to 10 years' imprisonment under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7508(a)(2)(ii).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that he possessed less than 10 grams of crack cocaine with an intent to deliver because he planned to use a portion of the cocaine. Alternatively, he argued that the procedure employed by the Commonwealth in weighing the drugs was flawed as it did not account for the variances in weight in the ziplock bags containing the cocaine. The appellate court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that defendant intended to distribute all 10.2 grams of the cocaine. The fact that the 87 baggies were in a larger plastic bag indicated defendant was preparing to distribute the drugs and the lack of use paraphernalia and the $ 480 on defendant's person indicated an intent to deliver. In addition, the extrapolation conducted by the Commonwealth accurately determined the weight of the drugs found on defendant because averaging 14 empty identical bags or 15% of the total bags accurately demonstrated the average weight of one bag and accounted for any variances between the bags. 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7508 did not violate equal protection rights because it was rationally related to the legislature's goal in fighting the spread of drugs in communities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, then a juvenile, was adjudicated a delinquent and placed in a sex offender treatment program. Later, the Court of Common Pleas of Wayne County (Pennsylvania) ordered his commitment under the Involuntary Treatment of Certain Sexually Violent Persons Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 6401-6409. Appellant challenged the trial court's decision. He argued in part that the Act was retroactive in violation of 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1926 and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the Act was not retroactive in effect. It did not relate to a juvenile's prior offenses, but to his current status. The Act was not punitive and thus did not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Its purpose was to provide necessary treatment and to protect the public, and it had a nonpunitive effect. As the Act was nonpunitive, it did not violate ex post facto principles. Next, the alleged inconvenience of disclosing information to mental health professionals in an attempt to effectuate a determination under the Act was greatly outweighed by the interest in treating juveniles and ensuring public safety. Disclosure under the Act did not violate 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6307, which stated that court files and records were open to inspection by the State Sexual Offenders Assessment Board. The Act did not violate equal protection. Although a right to physical freedom was fundamental, the Commonwealth had a compelling interest in protecting the public from danger. The Act, which provided for annual review as a means to guard against excessive commitment, was narrowly tailored to effectuate this interest. Finally, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6403(d) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County (Pennsylvania), defendant was found guilty of homicide by vehicle under 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3732, as well as the summary offenses of overtaking a vehicle on the right, reckless driving, following too closely, driving on roadways laned for traffic, and driving at a safe speed. He was sentenced to 8 to 23 months' imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised several issues. The appellate court found sufficient evidence that defendant was guilty of homicide by vehicle beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant's course of conduct immediately prior to the accident violated five separate provisions of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code. Defendant was speeding, tailgating, and erratically changing lanes, which was sufficient to show that he acted in a reckless and grossly negligent manner. Defendant's actions evidenced a conscious disregard of the substantial and unjustified risk that he would be involved in a traffic accident causing death. In addition, the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the sudden emergency doctrine because that doctrine, a civil concept, was not a recognized defense to which defendant was entitled to a jury instruction. Because this error had the potential to prejudice the Commonwealth, not defendant, defendant was not entitled to relief on his claim that the instruction was incorrect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Somerset County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of violating 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(a)(1) and (c), &sect; 1543(b)(1.1), and &sect; 3309(1), and sentenced him to one to five years' imprisonment for the driving under the influence (DUI) conviction, and a concurrent 90 days' imprisonment for the driving with a suspended license-DUI related conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged the denial of his suppression motion. The appellate court found that the trooper, a policeman with more than five years' experience, saw defendant swerve out of his lane of travel three times in a mere 30 seconds, in dense fog, on a road shared by oncoming traffic. Under such circumstances, the trooper possessed reasonable suspicion that defendant was violating a provision of the Motor Vehicle Code. Thus, the stop was legal and the trial court correctly denied the motion to suppress. Defendant also argued that he was erroneously sentenced as a four-time, instead of a three-time, DUI offender because when he pled guilty and entered the accelerated rehabilitative disposition (ARD) program following his first DUI, 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3806 stated that the guilty plea and entry into the ARD program could only be used in calculating his repeat offender status for seven years. The appellate court concluded that this argument had been addressed by the Tustin case. Thus, there was no error in the sentence imposed upon defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession with intent to deliver heroin, firearms possessed by a felon, and carrying a firearm without a license. The Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), sentenced him to 5 to 10 years for the drug charge, a consecutive term of two to four years for firearms possessed by a felon, and a consecutive term of one to two years for carrying a firearm without a license. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that he was illegally sentenced twice for the same criminal act of possessing a firearm without a license. In Pennsylvania, the Jones case provided a lead opinion approach to merger and a dissenting opinion approach to merger. The appellate court adopted the dissenting approach for two reasons. First, the dissenting approach reflected and gave proper deference to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9765, a statute that had not been ruled unconstitutional by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Second, the dissenting approach more accurately reflected the appellate court's jurisprudence on merger. Thus, the appellate court held that the trial court did not err as a matter of law by imposing separate sentences for the weapons offenses. 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6105(a) contained a statutory element that 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6106(a) did not: namely, conviction of an enumerated offense. Under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6105, the Commonwealth did not need to prove that defendant lacked a valid license. Rather, it only had to prove that defendant was convicted of an enumerated offense. Similarly, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6106(a) contained a statutory element that 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6105(a) did not: namely, lack of a valid license.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty but mentally ill of attempted homicide and aggravated assault (18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 314, 901, 2501, 2702), and guilty of possession of an instrument of crime (18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 907). The Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County (Pennsylvania) sentenced him to 14 to 28 years on the attempted homicide conviction and to not more than one year for the possession of an instrument of crime conviction. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, appellant raised several issues. The appellate court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant's convictions because the guilty but mentally ill convictions did not extinguish the requisite mens rea to impose criminal liability for criminal homicide and aggravated assault. In addition, the jury was free to resolve the conflict in the expert testimony in the Commonwealth's favor. Also, there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in rejecting appellant's claim that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence because this claim was predicated on the conflicting expert testimony, and the jury was free to believe the Commonwealth's expert. Finally, appellant argued that the jury instruction impermissibly allowed the jury to convict on a standard short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. However, appellant conceded that this very argument had been rejected by the appellate court. The trial court instructed the jury on the concepts of legal insanity and guilty but mentally ill using a suggested standard jury instruction that had been specifically approved by the appellate court, and correctly set forth the state of the law in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence imposed by the Butler County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) following his conviction at a bench trial of driving under the influence in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(d)(1)(i), (2) and (3), and several summary offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed that the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction under 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(d)(2) and (3). The Commonwealth's expert witness testified that the presence of metabolites was not an indication of present impairment but only that a substance was ingested sometime previously. The Commonwealth presented no evidence to support a conclusion that defendant was under the influence of a drug or combination of drugs and alcohol at the time he was stopped, such that his ability to drive was impaired. However, defendant's overbreadth challenge to 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(d)(1) failed because there was no constitutional right to the use of marijuana prior to driving. Defendant's equal protection challenge to 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(d)(1) also failed because there was no legislative classification upon which to base such an argument. 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(d)(1) prohibited the operation of a motor vehicle by any driver who had any amount of specifically enumerated controlled substances in his blood, regardless of impairment. All drivers were treated the same.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and judgment of sentence under 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(d)(1)(i), and reversed defendant's convictions under 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(d)(2) and (3) and discharged him as to those charges.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which convicted and sentenced him for violating 75 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3802(a)(1) and (b), 6503.1, 1543(B)(1.1)(ii), and 1501(a), relating to driving under the influence of alcohol, habitual offenders, driving while operating privilege was suspended or revoked, and driving without a valid license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised numerous issues. The appellate court concluded that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress because an officer was not required to have probable cause to effectuate a valid stop where the probable cause standard had been superseded by 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6308(b). The officer was only required to possess reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion was created as the result of a citizen's 911 call, and the officer's own observations of defendant driving on the wrong side of the road, and accelerating away from the police cruiser when the officer activated its overhead lights. Defendant's arguments raising constitutional challenges to the statutes under which he was convicted were rejected by the appellate court because the exact same arguments had been previously raised and rejected in a different case. Because one of defendant's arguments was not contained in his court ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement of matters complained of on appeal, it was waived. Finally, the trial court properly concluded that the failure to produce a videotape affected the weight of the officer's testimony, not the admissibility of that testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to chapter 64 of the Juvenile Code, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6401 et seq., the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), committed appellant to one year of involuntary civil commitment for juvenile sexual offenders. Appellant challenged the commitment order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the plain language of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6403(a), appellant was eligible for involuntary treatment even though he was in state prison rather than a juvenile facility on his 20th birthday. Although the literal language of the statute supported appellant's interpretation, it lead to an absurd result as his criminal actions while in a juvenile facility placed him in state prison. Thus, appellant's interpretation would have rendered 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6401 et seq., void by the intentional and criminal actions of the very people the law was intended to benefit. The claim that 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6403(d) was unconstitutionally void for vagueness failed as the phrase &quot;serious difficulty in controlling sexually violent behavior&quot; was no more vague than the words and phrases challenged in cases upholding Megan's Law II, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9791 et seq.&nbsp;42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6401 et seq., did not apply retroactively as it did not relate to a juvenile's prior offense; it only related to a juvenile's current and continuing status as a person who suffered a mental abnormality that resulted in serious difficulty controlling sexually violent behavior. The equal protection and cruel and unusual punishment claims also failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In three separate cases tried in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania) and in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), defendants were convicted of driving under the influence in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3801-3817. Defendants, who were represented by the same attorney, appealed. They raised identical issues challenging the constitutionality of the statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802 was not void for vagueness or overbroad because it did not contain a &quot;time nexus&quot; that would link the act of drinking with the subsequent act of driving. It gave a person of ordinary intelligence notice that he could not drive after imbibing a sufficient amount of alcohol to prevent him from driving safely. Furthermore, &sect; 3802 provided a reasonable standard for drivers to gauge their conduct. It was not overbroad because it punished drivers who might not have reached the prohibited blood alcohol level at the time of driving, but reached it later. The court had previously held that there was nothing in &sect; 3802 that arguably permitted a person to drive with a blood alcohol content (BAC) below a certain level. Next, the court had previously rejected an argument that &sect; 3802 was unconstitutional because police officers could discriminatorily or arbitrarily time the BAC test to ensnare drunk drivers. Finally, two defendants lacked standing to challenge the penal provision, 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3804(b), because there had not been an accident involved. The third had waived the issue under Pa.R.A.P. 2119 by not arguing as to how he was affected by the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant &quot;guilty but mentally ill&quot; and convicted him of criminal trespass and simple assault. The Venango County, Pennsylvania, Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, denied his post-sentence motion to modify costs and charged him with the costs of the prosecution's mental health expert. He appealed, arguing that 16 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1403, which required a convicted defendant to pay the costs of prosecution, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 1403 violated Fuller v. Oregon and was inadequate to protect his due process and equal protection rights because it did not require the trial court, before ordering him to pay the costs of prosecution, to take into account whether he had the ability to pay those costs. The appellate court disagreed. Fuller mandated only that &sect; 1403 contain a procedural device that ensured that a defendant would not be imprisoned if he was financially unable to pay the costs of prosecution. Although &sect; 1403 did not have any provisions providing an indigent defendant with an inquiry into his/her ability to pay, this did not mean that &sect; 1403 was constitutionally infirm per se. Pa. R. Crim. P. 706 was an adequate procedural tool that supplanted 16 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1403, and satisfied the constitutional requirements of Fuller, by ensuring that an indigent defendant was afforded an opportunity to prove his financial inability to pay the costs of prosecution before being sentenced to prison. Therefore, &sect; 1403 was constitutional on its face and as applied to the particular facts of the instant case.</SPAN></P>

The victim's death in a car accident prevented the trial court from making a determination under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5985.1(a.1). Since that prerequisite to a determination of unavailability could not be made, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5985.1 did not apply, and the court was constrained to conclude that the trial court erred in its application and in the subsequent admission of the hearsay statements in violation of the confrontation clause. The Pa. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the victim was fourteen, she joined an internet chat room which required all participants to be at least eighteen. The victim and defendant met at the chat room and later began a sexual relationship. Although the parties disputed when defendant learned the victim was fourteen, he sent her instant messages which stated that he could go to jail for the things that they did together and suggesting that he wanted to &quot;get back together&quot; with her. Based on DNA in a condom used by defendant and the victim shortly before his arrest, defendant was convicted of unlawful contact. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's sentence. The court found that defendant continued to have sex with the victim after he learned of her age. The instant messages were sufficient to affirm defendant's conviction for unlawful contact, and the evidence was contrary to defendant's claim that he only contacted the victim because he wanted their once-sexual relationship to be a platonic friendship. 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6318 was neither overbroad nor unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

There was no ambiguity in such a clear statement as &quot;I hereby give up all my rights to sue or make claim.&quot; A reasonable person would have understood that he was waiving all rights to bring a claim, without qualification.

The prosecutorial misconduct claims were waived as appellant failed to provide citations to the record in his brief. The trial court lacked legal authority to grant appellant's pretrial motion to grant immunity to his wife as the Commonwealth had not proffered the request. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to take a witness' testimony by satellite or web cast during trial as the witness was not unavailable. The trial court's decision to suspend sequestration for one day to allow jurors to return home for a night to prepare for an extended trial was upheld as appellant failed to show any prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Perry County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), after a nonjury trial in which the trial court convicted defendant of driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or a controlled substance, in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(c). Defendant received a sentence of 90 days to 18 months, a fine, and an 18-month license suspension.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it discretion under Pa. R. Crim. P. 575 to rule on the challenges. On review, the court found that the law was valid and upheld the judgment of sentence. The court determined that the rational basis test was applicable to defendant's due process and equal protection challenges because driving was a privilege and not a fundamental right and there was no right to the consumption of any quantity of alcohol before driving. 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(c) was not overbroad because the pertinent question was not what an individual's blood alcohol content (BAC) was at the time of driving but rather what the BAC was as determined by a test taken within two hours of driving. Further, defendant had no standing to challenge portions of the statute other than that provision under which she was convicted. The law did not permit and promote arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement because it was constitutionally permissible to require a person to monitor his or her conduct so as to ensure that he or she did not have a prohibited BAC at any time within two hours of driving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from the sexual assault of two women. Upon executing a search warrant of defendant's home, the police found hair from the victims and semen recovered from them matched defendant as well. The court found that during the Megan's Law III hearing, a doctor testified that defendant had an antisocial personality disorder characterized by a lifetime history of failure to conform his conduct to the norms of society, a callous disregard for other's feelings, and no remorse for his crimes. The court found that the Commonwealth proved by clear and convincing evidence that defendant suffered from a mental abnormality and/or personality disorder based on the extreme nature of the sadism in the case and the fact there was a separation of time between when defendant picked up the two victims. The court found no merit to defendant's sentencing challenges and that the jury's verdict was not against the weight of the evidence. The court noted that the alleged inconsistencies defendant pointed out between the two victims were minor in light of the overwhelming evidence presented against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a bench trial in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), of two counts of driving under the influence (DUI), in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(a)(1) and (c), and one count of careless driving. He appealed, alleging the evidence was insufficient and that &sect; 3802(c) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer saw defendant and his vehicle in brush by the side of a road. Defendant said he lost control of his vehicle. The officer detected a strong odor of alcohol, administered field sobriety tests, and arrested defendant after he failed to complete them to the officer's satisfaction. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .326 percent. The appellate court held that given the broad wording of defendant's Pa.R.A.P. 1925 statement, he failed to preserve his constitutional challenges to the DUI statute. But it agreed with his contention that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions for both 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(a)(1) and (c). The &sect; 3802(c) conviction could not stand, as an element of that offense was having a BAC of .16 percent or more within two hours of driving, and there was no evidence as to when his blood was drawn. His &sect; 3802(a)(1) conviction was also invalid, as there was no evidence as to the time of his drinking or when he last drove. Though the officer may have promptly responded to a dispatch reporting the accident, there was no evidence as to when the accident occurred; moreover, no circumstances negated the possibility of post-accident alcohol consumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of sentence for DUI was reversed and the judgment of sentence for careless driving was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence entered after a no contest plea in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) for corruption of minors and aggravated indecent assault. Defendant was found to be a sexually violent predator (SVP). Defendant appealed, filed a timely Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement, and filed an untimely supplemental Rule 1925(b) statement. The trial court addressed both Rule 1925(b) statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Pennsylvania Megan's Law II, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9791 et seq., was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that as defendant did not file a separate petition seeking prior court approval before filing his untimely supplemental Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement, he waived the specific challenges to Megan's Law he set forth in that statement. Defendant generally claimed that Megan's Law II was unconstitutional in his initial Rule 1925(b) statement and in his Pa. R. Crim. P. 704(B) motion, but as defendant did not file a timely post-sentence motion, he failed to preserve any general challenge to the constitutionality of Megan's Law II. There was sufficient evidence to find that defendant was an SVP. A psychologist's failure to interview defendant and his reliance on defendant's juvenile behavior did not preclude the SVP finding. Defendant was 21 when he committed the offenses and had been almost continuously committed to mental health and juvenile detention facilities throughout his teenage years. His inappropriate behavior included repeated episodes of sexually inappropriate or assaultive behavior. There was sufficient evidence that defendant was an SVP.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth claimed that the trial court erred in not designating defendant an SVP under Megan's Law II, contending that its burden of proof was satisfied by an expert's testimony identifying defendant as an SVP, citing that expert's conclusion that defendant met the criteria for SVP status because he suffered from mental abnormalities, specifically pedophilia and paraphilia. As such, the Commonwealth argued that the trial court should give defendant a longer period of incarceration, find him to be a SVP, and subject him to lifetime registration under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.1(b)(1). The court disagreed and held that the Commonwealth did not meet its burden of proving defendant was a SVP since the Commonwealth did not provide clear and convincing evidence demonstrating that defendant was likely to re-offend because he suffered from a mental defect or personality disorder. The court found the Commonwealth's expert testified that defendant did not satisfy several of the criteria in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.4 supporting SVP classification.</SPAN></P>

Evidence that defendant fled at the time of his arrest was properly admitted. The sentence of 17 and 1/2 to 40 years imposed on defendant for attempted murder was illegal because no sentence greater than 20 years could be imposed under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1102(c) when the jury was not asked to determine whether serious bodily injury resulted. Defendant was not charged with attempted murder resulting in serious bodily injury. His conviction for aggravated assault did not supply the required finding because it was solely the jury's responsibility to find each element of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated the entire sentence imposed upon defendant and otherwise affirmed the judgment. The matter was remanded to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing and for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to indecent assault and corruption of minors. The Commonwealth petitioned for a determination that defendant was a sexually violent predator (SVP) under the Pennsylvania Megan's Law II, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9791-- 9799.7. The Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Criminal Division, granted the petition. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he sexually assaulted an 11-year-old girl. At the time of the assault, he was on parole and being treated for sexually assaulting his eight-year-old niece over a three-year period. The appellate court held that as the medical evidence showed that defendant was diagnosed with pedophilia, and that this condition could not be cured, he could not show that the lack of judicial reviewability of an SVP finding in Megan's Law II rendered it unconstitutionally overbroad and excessive. His &quot;void for vagueness&quot; challenge also failed. First, the term &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; as used in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9792, and the lesser included words and phrases contained therein, were not unconstitutionally vague. Second, defendant failed to present evidence that the criteria enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.4(b), which were used to determine SVP status, were non-predictive. Finally, evidence that he repeatedly committed sexual assaults upon two young girls, and assaulted the second girl while he was under probationary supervision and was receiving counseling for a prior assault on the first girl, was sufficient to establish that he was an SVP.</SPAN></P>

The minor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court adjudicated the minor delinquent for possession of a firearm after a probation officer found a gun under a mattress where the minor was sitting. Officers went to the home to serve an arrest warrant on the minor's brother. The minor's stepmother told the officers that the brother was not home but that the minor was in his bedroom. Officers entered the bedroom and found the gun. The appellate court found that, as a proper protective sweep was based on an initial arrest, and as the officers had not arrested the brother, the search of the home for the brother did not implicate the protective sweep doctrine. The fact the minor was shaking during the pat-down search, which showed the officer that the minor was hiding something, was irrelevant since the threshold issue was if the officer had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or a probation violation before the personal search. A tip that the minor was involved in a shooting did not form reasonable suspicion because the officer could not articulate whether this information was from a known or anonymous informant, and had no specific and articulable facts which reasonably suggested that this tip was correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from the death of his girlfriend's nearly three year-old daughter.

The trial court imposed that sentence despite the fact that the jury was not charged that in order to find defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the second degree, they must find that the victim was under 12 years of age and also in the care, custody, or control of the person who caused the death. The court found the failure of the trial court to submit those factual determinations to be error. The court held that those factual determinations constituted elements of the offense of involuntary manslaughter graded as a felony of the second degree and must either be admitted by defendant or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled nolo contendere to several offenses after he molested a three-year-old girl. Prior to a Megan's Law II, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 9791-99, hearing, appellant's motion for extraordinary relief was denied. The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) found appellant to be a sexually violent predator, imposed sentence, and ordered him to comply with the Megan's Law II registration requirements. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court concluded that appellant's constitutional claims were waived because Pa. R. Crim. P. 704(B)(3) specifically declared that any motion for extraordinary relief had to be preserved via a post-trial motion. Appellant's pre-sentence motion alone was neither necessary nor sufficient to preserve the issues for appeal. Moreover, appellant's constitutional claims merely required the appellate court to revisit issues that had already been decided; the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had previously held that the requirements of Megan's Law II did not constitute punishment. Also, the evidence was sufficient to prove appellant was a sexually violent predator. The Commonwealth established that he had been convicted of a sexually violent offense as set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.1; specifically, appellant pled nolo contendere to aggravated indecent assault and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Then, the Commonwealth established, through the testimony of an expert who appellant stipulated was an expert in the field of sexual offender evaluation and treatment, that appellant had a personality disorder that made him likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, upon a guilty plea, of aggravated indecent assault, indecent assault, corruption of minors, and terroristic threats. The Lancaster County Common Pleas Court, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), directed defendant to submit to the non-sexually violent predator (SVP) offender provisions of Megan's Law II, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9791-99.9. Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence, which on remand classified him as an SVP.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth argued that its expert's testimony supported the SVP finding. The appellate court held that the expert testified that defendant suffered from paraphelia NOS, based on defendant's criminal history, which included convictions for the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl and the rape of a woman. Defendant did not challenge the diagnosis. The expert's ultimate opinion regarding defendant's SVP status did not rest solely on the diagnosis of a mental abnormality. The expert testified as to the statutory factors set out in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9795.4(b) and applied the factors to defendant's case. The factors that weighed toward an SVP classification included the number of victims, the nature of the contact (penetration), the age of the victims, defendant's criminal history, defendant's history of alcohol abuse, and defendant's use of a shotgun to threaten one of the victims. The expert properly concluded that defendant was likely to re-offend, based on defendant's mental abnormality, defendant's prior history of sexual offenses, and the fact that despite serving time in prison for the prior convictions, defendant committed the instant crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a bench trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) of simple assault, possession of a controlled substance, and resisting arrest, following the denial of his pre-trial motion to suppress evidence. He was sentenced to 18 months of reporting probation. Defendant appealed and complied with a court order to file a Pa. R. App. P. 1925(b) statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was not probable cause to support an investigatory stop. The officers found a drug suspect with a group of men in an area known for drug problems, gun problems, and violent reactions to the police. Under the totality of the circumstances, there was a reasonable suspicion that the drug suspect's companions were armed and dangerous. A safety-oriented frisk was warranted. The police properly ordered defendant to place his hands on a fence and to submit to a frisk. Although defendant at first complied, he then began pushing off the fence. Defendant kicked backward, striking the officer in the knee, which resulted in bruising and swelling. Thus, there was sufficient evidence to support the simple assault conviction. The assault provided grounds for defendant's arrest. Defendant struggled during the attempt to arrest him. He was taken into custody, but continued to resist attempts to subdue him by spitting blood and saliva at the officer, which created a substantial risk of bodily injury. The evidence supported the resisting arrest conviction. Finally, the search of defendant incident to the assault arrest was valid. The suppression motion was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

In a post-sentence hearing, defendant's constitutional challenges to Megan's Law II and his claim that there was insufficient evidence to support the SVP determination were denied. On appeal, the court found no merit to defendant's constitutional challenges. After an examination of the two-level analysis of Mendoza-Martinez adopted in Williams II, the court held that the lack of a mechanism for judicial review of SVP status did not render Megan's Law II unconstitutionally excessive. Defendant had not established that he had a curable personality disorder. Further, his void-for-vagueness challenge also failed, as he did not show that the assessment procedures for a determination of SVP classification were unreliable. There was clear and convincing evidence that supported the SVP determination concerning defendant, pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9792.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed by another driver striking an on-coming truck head-on with his car, killing the truck's two occupants. Upon arrival at the scene, the police found opened and unopened cans of beer. Defendant's Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) was tested and he was found intoxicated, in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3802. On appeal, defendant contested the constitutionality of the main statutes he was convicted under, particularly because the two hour time frame provided in &sect; 3802(c) allegedly violated due process as a driver was unable to gauge when his or her drinking ripened into a crime. The court found &sect; 3802(c) was neither vague nor overly broad. The court noted that defendant wrongly assumed that one of the essential elements of the offense was having a 0.16 percent BAC at the time of driving, but a person's blood alcohol level at driving time simply was not part of &sect; 3802(c). The court did determine that the DUI and homicide by vehicle while DUI merged for sentencing purposes and that, therefore, defendant was entitled to have the DUI sentence vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly induced his attorney to file a claim with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA), asserting he sustained injuries on a SEPTA trolley when it suddenly stopped. In fact, there were no passengers on the trolley when the power became disconnected. Defendant's Pa. R.

Because of that general language, the trial judge only discussed the sufficiency of the evidence in general terms. A concise statement that was too vague to allow the trial court to identify the issues raised on appeal constituted a waiver of those issues. Defendant's claim on appeal was that SEPTA was not a &quot;person&quot; under the terms of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;1440. Because the specific issue as to whether SEPTA was a &quot;person&quot; under &sect;&nbsp;1440 was not presented to the trial court, the issue was waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since her adjudication of dependency, the student had been in the care of her paternal aunt and uncle.

The trial court ordered the agency to provide the student with a college rate of $ 14 per day while she was living away from her foster home and enrolled in college classes. On remand, the appellate court found that the decision in Curtis, finding that Act 62, 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4327(a), was unconstitutional, had no application because Act 62 only pertained to private support matters. Moreover, the case was not about the agency providing post-secondary educational support.

The prisoner appealed an order entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania) granting the DA's motion to dismiss. The DA moved to quash the prisoner's brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DA did not object to the appellate court's exercise of jurisdiction. The appellate court retained jurisdiction. The prisoner's brief failed to present legal arguments or legal citations supporting the prisoner's claims, but the claims were reviewed. The prisoner was primarily concerned with inconsistencies between the victim's testimony at the prisoner's criminal trial and a medical report. However, the differences between the victim's testimony and the medical report were fully explored during the criminal trial and the jury resolved the discrepancies and made credibility determinations. Even if the actions of the deputy district attorney (DDA) who prosecuted the prisoner and the DDA who approved the charges were faulty, the prisoner failed to implicate the DA. As &sect; 1405 provided for criminal penalties, liability had to be based on personal causation; imposition of liability pursuant to a respondeat superior theory was impermissible. The prisoner did not support his allegations of wrongdoing or willful and gross negligence by the DA. Finally, the prisoner admitted that he filed the suit due to the filing of an Anders brief in his criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

However, based on the officer's observations of defendant's slurred speech, uncoordinated movements, his unwillingness to speak directly to him, and an open case of beer in the back seat, as well as defendant's failed field sobriety test and his blood alcohol test results, it was determined that defendant was intoxicated and that his driver's license was suspended. Defendant's suppression motion was denied on the basis that the amendment to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6308(b) rendered the standard of Whitmyer inapplicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that the trial court erred in denying the petition for redemption pursuant to the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Law, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7293. The appellate court found that the ability of a prior owner to redeem property sold at a sheriff's sale contained a restriction outlined in 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7293(c), which limited redemption to non-vacant property occupied as a residence. The property in question was a mixed use property in that a restaurant and tavern were located on the lower floor, with the upper floors being residential in nature. The owner acknowledged that the upper floors were not occupied at the time in question. Therefore, the appellate court held that the owner did not have a statutory right to redeem the property in question. The appellate court also held that the owner failed to raise an argument that 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7239 was unconstitutional during the trial. Therefore, that argument could not be considered on appeal. Thus, the appellate court held that the trial court properly denied the owner's petition for redemption.</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth appealed the dismissal, upon defendant's motion for habeas corpus relief, by the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), of the re-filed complaint against defendant for reckless endangerment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth argued that it was permissible to re-file the complaint. The appellate court held that the procedure employed by the Commonwealth did not violate defendant's procedural due process rights. The Commonwealth established a prima facie case against defendant. It was a misnomer to say that the sex between defendant and the victim was consensual as defendant did not inform the victim of his HIV infection. If conduct by an HIV-positive defendant satisfied the elements of recklessly endangering another person, the Commonwealth could prosecute that defendant. The Commonwealth established that defendant knew that he was infected with HIV when he had sex with the victim. Judicial notice should have been taken that defendant's conduct might have placed the victim in danger of serious bodily injury as the conduct might have placed the victim in danger of contracting HIV. Finally, the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to make a prima facie case that defendant's decision to have oral sex with the victim without informing him that defendant was HIV-positive was a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the victim was improperly allowed to testify by closed circuit television. The appellate court held that the victim was properly allowed to testify by closed circuit television as there was expert testimony that the victim suffered from depression, suicidal thoughts, and post-traumatic stress disorder, which likely would impact her ability to testify effectively, and that the presence of defendant in the courtroom would impair the victim's ability to reasonably communicate with the jury. The victim's out-of-court statements to a state police trooper and a child services agency employee were properly admitted under the tender years exception to the hearsay rule as defense counsel had had an opportunity to cross-examine the victim. The convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence as the victim testified that defendant rubbed his penis against her, touched her vagina, and had sexual intercourse with her on multiple occasions when she was approximately four and one-half years old. Finally, defendant's classification as an SVP was supported by expert testimony that defendant was a pedophile who was likely to engage in predatory sexual offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed suit against appellees, a driver and his employer, seeking damages for personal injuries. Appellees filed a new matter, which invoked the Pennsylvania Comparative Negligence Act. Appellees were permitted to join appellee doctor. The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) sustained the doctor's objection to venue and transferred the case to the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the claim against the doctor was not a &quot;medical professional liability claim.&quot; The appellate court held that the joinder complaint did not set forth a medical professional liability claim under the Pennsylvania Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Act, 40 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1303.101 et seq., as it did not demand damages for appellees against the doctor. Appellees did not assert a tort or breach of contract claim against the doctor as patients or representatives of patients. Instead, appellees sought judgment for them as against appellant, or a jury ruling on the doctor's liability to appellant if appellant succeeded. Thus, Pa. R. Civ. P. 1006(a.1) did not apply and the transfer was improper. Appellant's claim of error in the late joinder of the doctor failed. The joinder order was a non-appealable interlocutory order as it did not dispose of all claims and all parties and was not expressly defined as a final order by statute. The trial court did not certify the order as immediately appealable and an order granting joinder of a party was not a basis for an interlocutory appeal as of right. The appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order sustaining the doctor's objection to venue and transferring the matter was reversed. The matter was remanded to the original trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), following his convictions for risking a catastrophe and recklessly endangering another person in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3302(b), 2705. He also appealed the trial court order, which denied his motion for return of property and directed his forfeiture of $ 34,000 to the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for risking a catastrophe. The appellate court concluded that, while flying an airplane, absent other factors, might not be per se dangerous, defendant flew his plane while intoxicated for four hours in restricted airspace around a heavily trafficked, urban, restricted airport. He flew at unpredictable speeds, altitudes, and directions, in close proximity to other aircraft. In two instances, defendant's plane flew head-on at other aircraft and came close to the cooling towers of a nuclear power plant. Contact between defendant's aircraft and any of these could have caused widespread damage to the populated areas below, a nuclear power disaster, or injury or death to the other pilots and their passengers. Thus, defendant's intoxicated condition and reckless operation of his aircraft fell within the meaning of &quot;other means of causing potentially widespread injury or damage&quot; in 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3302(a). In addition, the Commonwealth provided a sufficient nexus between the airplane and defendant's crimes to justify the characterization of the plane as derivative contraband, subject to forfeiture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of sentence of the trial court was affirmed. The order of forfeiture was also affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which sentenced him to an aggregate term of 14 1/4 to 29 years' imprisonment after he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of children, escape, and resisting arrest. Defendant's counsel filed a petition to withdraw pursuant to Anders and McClendon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's counsel filed a petition stating that he had made a conscientious review of the record and that the appeal was wholly frivolous. The appellate court concluded that, although appointed counsel fulfilled the mechanical requirements for successfully seeking leave to withdraw his representation, it could not agree with the assessment that the appeal was wholly frivolous. The sole issue briefed, that defendant's sentence violated the decision in Apprendi, was an issue that appeared to have at least arguable merit that compelled briefing by an interested advocate as opposed to one seeking to withdraw his representation due to his assessment that the appeal was wholly frivolous. Specifically, a comparison of the elements of endangering the welfare of children found in 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 4304 and 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2504, the provision that elevated the grading of involuntary manslaughter, revealed that the two were not identical. In addition, the lack of a complete transcript prevented the appellate court from discharging its obligation to conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether there existed any issues of arguable merit to pursue on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court denied counsel's petition to withdraw and remanded the case for the filing of an advocate's brief and completion of the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Snyder County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) entered judgments in a first case and a second case that ordered the first defendant and the second defendant, respectively, to submit DNA samples to be stored in a DNA data bank and to pay a mandatory cost of $250. The first defendant and the second defendant appealed, and the appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases, the trial court ordered the first defendant and the second defendant to submit a DNA sample to a data bank and pay a mandatory cost of $ 250. Those provisions were ordered pursuant to 44 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 2301-2336 (DNA Act). The first defendant was ordered to do so after her offense of retail theft was graded a felony of the third degree pursuant to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3929(b) due to two prior retail theft convictions. The second defendant was ordered to do so based on his guilty plea to two misdemeanor retail theft counts. After the cases were consolidated for the purposes of appeal, the appellate court found that the order as to the first defendant had to be affirmed because her offense was within the purview of the DNA Act that directed the taking of DNA samples and payment of the mandatory fee for those people who had committed felony offenses. It also rejected her contention that the DNA Act violated the ex post facto clause of the federal and state constitutions since the directives of the DNA were administrative, not punitive, in nature. Finally, it concluded that the second defendant's two misdemeanors were not within the purview of the DNA Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment against the first defendant was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence imposed by the Butler County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), after defendant was convicted of child pornography offenses under 18 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asked the appellate court to determine whether the 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;6312 prohibitions against the sexual abuse of children were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Defendant claimed that &sect; 6312 criminalized the possession of material containing computer-generated depictions of children engaged in prohibited sexual activity as well as depictions of real children involved in prohibited sexual activity. In a previous case, the appellate court had held that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6312(d) applied only to real rather than computer-generated images and that &sect; 6312(d) was not overbroad when applied to possession of real images. In the instant case, the trial court similarly concluded that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6312 required involvement of a real child rather than a computer-generated image. Thus, the trial court required the Commonwealth to demonstrate that the materials that were seized from defendant depicted actual children and not computer-generated images. In the instant case, defendant was making the same argument as the one that the appellate court rejected in previous case law. The appellate court was bound by its prior decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence from the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which convicted defendant of two counts of driving under the influence (DUI) in violation of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3802 and one count of violating 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3309(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lost control of his vehicle and crashed. Police officers observed that defendant smelled of alcohol, had bloodshot eyes, and slurred his speech. Defendant was arrested and transported to a hospital, where a blood test revealed that defendant's blood alcohol content exceeded the limit stated in 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3802(c). The court held that defendant's violations of two subsections of &sect; 3802 were properly merged for sentencing purposes. Defendant's arrest was not invalid because the arresting officer cited a recently repealed statutory section upon his arrest, rather than the newly enacted &sect; 3802. A warrantless arrest on probable cause was proper under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3811. Because defendant consented to the blood test, he was not entitled to relief on the basis that he was not informed of the consequences of refusal under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1547. Defendant had no right to counsel before consenting to the test. 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3802 was not vague or overbroad, and its use of a longer period for enhancement did not constitute an ex post facto law. There was no equal protection violation in imposing higher penalties based on higher amounts of blood alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies argued that the trial court improperly determined that an adequate administrative remedy existed to address their counterclaim that the insurer applied an incorrect final premium rate when charging for workers' compensation insurance coverage. The appellate court noted that the trial judge explained why he reached the conclusion that the companies could have sought the relief they now requested had they pursued a timely claim before the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau (Bureau). The Bureau had no authority to adjudicate a contracts dispute, but it did have the authority to rule in a dispute over the application of rate classifications in a given case. The companies argued that Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 77, &sect; 1035.17 was unconstitutional. The appellate court agreed that &sect; 1035.17 did not give notice as to the time period in which a claimant could initiate action; however, the companies did not challenge the constitutionality of the manner in which the pertinent agency rules were promulgated, nor did they raise a claim that the specific agency rules operated to deprive them of their due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which imposed sentence upon defendant after he refused to consent to submit to a blood alcohol content (BAC) test and was convicted of driving under the influence in a bench trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3802(a)(2), (b) and (c) were vague and/or overbroad. The appellate court concluded that because defendant was not convicted of violating these provisions, he had no standing to challenge their constitutionality. Defendant also argued that evidence of his refusal to submit to a BAC test should have been suppressed as he was not provided an opportunity to consult with counsel before deciding whether to give consent to undergo a BAC test. The decision to consent to a BAC test had strategic implications. However, such strategic tactical decisions had not been recognized as critical stages of the proceedings so as to invoke the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. A request to submit to a BAC test represented the government's efforts to gather evidence already in existence. Encounters involving the gathering of evidence were not considered &quot;critical proceedings&quot; for purposes of the right to counsel. Thus, the provision of counsel at this stage was not constitutionally mandated and the denial of the right to confer with counsel prior to deciding whether to submit to chemical testing did not render defendant's refusal inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Common Pleas of Jefferson County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), convicted defendant of rape, attempted rape, attempted involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, statutory sexual assault, indecent assault, corruption of a minor, and endangering the welfare of a child. It was determined that defendant was a sexually violent predator and he was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 26 to 52 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, the child of defendant's girlfriend, testified that the sexual abuse occurred weekly over a two-year period. In sentencing defendant, the trial court considered evidence of other uncharged crimes, alleging sexual abuse of two other children. The superior court found that the evidence linking defendant to those other crimes of sexual abuse stood unrefuted. That evidence sprang from defendant's own mouth and was confirmed by the victims. In addition, the trial court clearly found, based upon defendant's abuse of his victims, that he was a threat to children and needed to be sentenced above the guidelines ranges for the protection of the public. Even if the superior court were to conclude that the uncharged conduct should not have been considered by the trial court, the trial court offered significant other support for sentencing in excess of the guidelines in the victim's case as he sexually abused her nearly weekly for two years, he attempted to justify his actions, and his propensities and the justification that he offered for his behavior made him a poor candidate for rehabilitation. Thus, his sentence was not unreasonable under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9781(c)(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol content of .10 percent or more in violation of former 75 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant questioned the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction. The appellate court found that the blood alcohol content (BAC) testing was performed within one hour of driving and established defendant's BAC at .105 percent. Given the .105 percent reading and the five percent margin of error, defendant's BAC was exactly .10 percent one hour after driving. The Commonwealth's expert witness admitted that defendant's BAC could have been less than .10 percent when he was driving when she conceded that she was unable to opine that it was rising between 12:30 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. Since defendant's BAC was exactly .10 percent one hour after driving and since the Commonwealth conceded that it could have been rising, the inference of guilt was too weak to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's BAC was .10 percent or over when he was driving.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), sentencing him under the three strikes law, Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714, after he was found guilty of robbery. He challenged the constitutionality of a photo identification, the seizure of a toy gun from his car, and the imposition of an enhanced sentence based on a judge's findings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had apparently robbed a convenience store at gunpoint, but a toy gun, which officers initially mistook for a real gun, was found in his car when officers stopped the car because of the car's, and defendant's, resemblance to descriptions given by victims of another robbery. The court held, first, that the photo array in which the store clerk identified defendant had not been unduly suggestive. It had been assembled using a computer program that located photographs of other persons who resembled defendant, and the motions judge had commented on the quality of the random sample. The toy gun was also properly not suppressed. The officers had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that the car had been involved in another robbery, and, furthermore, the officers were empowered by statute to stop the car once they saw its expired license tag. Once the car was stopped, the toy gun was in plain view. Finally, the exception to Apprendi's requirements for enhancements based solely on criminal history validated the three strikes law as defendant's prior convictions were amply demonstrated on the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence entered in the Huntingdon County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), after his conviction of a second drunk driving offense. He argued that his sentencing as a recidivist violated due process because instead of applying a seven-year lookback period, pursuant to former 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731, the trial court applied the amended 10-year lookback period of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3806.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of defendant's first drunk driving arrest, the former statute had provided that successive convictions within seven years would result in sentencing as a second offender. Three months before his second arrest, &sect; 3806 was enacted, changing the lookback period to 10 years. Defendant argued that application of the enhanced sentencing provision to him violated his due process rights because it effectively imposed a greater penalty on him for the original offense. The court held that Pennsylvania and federal law had consistently found no due process violation in a situation such as defendant's, because defendant was always on notice as to what conduct would result in an enhanced punishment. The legislature was always free to provide for enhanced penalties by amending a sentencing statute, as long as potential violators were advised of the penalties they faced.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas, Chester County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), upon his conviction of driving under the influence and failing to stay in his lane. He challenged the constitutionality of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6308(b), the statute that provided the basis for the traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer with experience in observing and arresting drunk drivers noticed defendant's vehicle drifting back and forth, sometimes leaving his lane. After following him for a while, he stopped defendant, fearing he would collide with an upcoming obstacle. At that point, defendant's intoxicated condition became obvious, and he was arrested. An earlier version of &sect; 6308(b), which required an officer to have articulable and reasonable grounds to believe the Vehicle Code was being violated in order to effect a traffic stop, had been held to require probable cause, but the amended version required only a reasonable suspicion. Defendant argued that this lower standard violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The court found no constitutional infirmity, at least where the violation in question involved driving under the influence, one of the few offenses for which a stop to determine if a violation was occurring would be helpful. The interest of public safety weighed heavily when balanced against individuals' rights to be left alone, and a traffic stop alone, based on the observations of an experienced officer, was minimally intrusive.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P. 1042.3 to support his medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband's wife died of cancer, which the husband attributed to silicone breast implants that caused the cancer and to misdiagnosis that ultimately led to her death. The husband initially filed a medical malpractice action in federal court, but that action was transferred to state court. The husband never filed a certificate of merit required by Pa. R. Civ. P. 1042.3. Judgments of non pros were entered for the providers due to the failure to file the certificate. The husband appealed, arguing that, regardless of the fact that the suit was filed after the effective date of Rule 1042.3, requiring a certificate represented a retroactive application of the rule because the acts of misconduct occurred prior to the effective date of the rule. The rule added a procedural requirement for going forward with the suit and the fact that the husband would draw upon, or relate back, to antecedent events did not constitute a retroactive application of the rule. The rule did not in any way alter the legal effects of the husband's alleged acts of misconduct, so the rule did not have retroactive application. Since the husband filed the suit after the effective date of the rule, the rule applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assaulted another man, who he believed had committed a sexual crime upon his step-daughter. He was convicted of several crimes, and the mandatory minimum sentence was imposed under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9712. Defendant then sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the mandatory minimum sentence for the visible possession of a firearm did not violate Blakely. The Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines were not mandatory; the mere fact that the mandatory minimum divested the courts of the discretion to impose a lower sentence did not implicate constitutional concerns. Next, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the kidnapping conviction under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2901. The evidence showed that the victim was transported a substantial distance to a secluded area for the assault. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting photographs of the assault scene where evidence was found. The photos were authenticated by the persons who located the evidence. Lastly, testimony about the seizure of a weapon from defendant's home was proper authentication, and blood evidence on defendant's clothes was relevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which denied its petition to transfer defendant's criminal proceeding from the Philadelphia Municipal Court to the Court of Common Pleas so that it could exercise its right to a jury trial. Defendant was arrested and charged with four counts of theft, receiving stolen property, and theft by failure to make required disposition of funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges alleged that defendant, a police officer, acquired approximately $ 1,500 during four separate narcotics investigations and failed to surrender that money to the Police Evidence Custodian. Because the charges were all graded as misdemeanors of the first degree, defendant's case had been scheduled to be heard by a judge in the municipal court pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1123(a)(2). However, since jury trials were not held in municipal court, and the Commonwealth wanted to exercise its right to a jury trial guaranteed by Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6, it petitioned to transfer the case to the court of common pleas. The court found that Pa. R. Crim. P. 1001 only detailed how a defendant could petition to have the case transferred but made no similar provision for the Commonwealth. Since a procedural rule was unable to usurp the Commonwealth's constitutional right, the proper method of effectuating the Commonwealth's right was to petition the court to transfer the case. The absence of a procedural rule was no basis for denying the Commonwealth its constitutional guarantee of a trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with multiple crimes arising from two incidents where he attacked his girlfriend. He was also charged in federal court on drug charges. At various times, five attorneys were appointed to aid him, and defendant was also granted a motion to proceed pro se. After he was convicted and sentenced, he appealed. He raised a multitude of issues. The court found that his right to a speedy trial under Pa. R. Crim. P. 600 was not violated because he was unavailable for trial while he was in federal custody on the drug charges. He was also not denied his right under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, to be present at trial where he demanded that he be removed from the courtroom and was disruptive. His right to counsel was forfeited by a pattern of abusing his appointed counsel and refusing to cooperate with them in his defense. Change of venue was not warranted without proof of pervasive pretrial publicity, and assault charges were properly consolidated. However, because simple assault was a lesser included offense of reckless endangerment, the crimes should have been merged for sentencing, and a remand for resentencing was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions but remanded for resentencing on simple assault and recklessly endangering another person and for resentencing of a fine that was imposed after a determination of defendant's ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which found him guilty of carrying a firearm without a license and sentenced him to three years' probation. Defendant was stopped for violating a noise ordinance, Philadelphia, Pa., Code &amp; Charter, Traffic Code &sect; 12-1126, and a handgun was found in plain view in his vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the noise ordinance. The appellate court found that the ordinance provided fair notice as to the prohibited conduct: it was a violation to operate a sound reproduction device inside a vehicle, in the City of Philadelphia, so that it was capable of being heard outside of the vehicle at a distance of greater than 25 feet. The distance standard provided an explicit guideline to those charged with enforcing the ordinance. Because the ordinance provided fair notice as to prohibited conduct, defendant failed to demonstrate that it was unconstitutional on its face. Defendant's applied challenge also failed because the Commonwealth established defendant's clear violation of the ordinance. The appellate court also concluded that the ordinance was not facially overbroad. The ordinance was content neutral because it restricted excess noise regardless of the content of the communications emanating from sound reproduction devices, and the ordinance was narrowly tailored to serve the city's significant interest in stemming loud noise. Thus, the traffic stop was based on probable cause and the subsequent seizure of the handgun was legal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court violated the plea agreement by imposing consecutive sentences and by not allowing defendant to withdraw his plea. On appeal, defendant argued that his failure to file a direct appeal did not operate as a waiver of his sentencing claim because challenges to the legality of a sentence were never waived. The appellate court found that defendant did not move to withdraw his plea, did not file post-sentence motions, and did not file a direct appeal. Instead, he filed a petition under the PCRA, in which he requested that he be allowed to withdraw his guilty pleas. Because defendant failed to raise his claim in the trial court or on direct appeal, the issue was waived unless an exception to the waiver rule applied. However, the appellate court concluded that no exception applied because current case law did not support the proposition that defendant's claim was a non-waivable challenge to the legality of the sentence where defendant did not identify any statutory basis or double jeopardy basis for declaring that his sentence was illegal. Thus, defendant's issue was waived.</SPAN></P>

Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9795.1(b)(2), was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, which were predicate offenses triggering an adjudication of sexually violent predator (SVP) status under Pennsylvania's Registration of Sexual Offenders Act (Megan's Law II), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9795.1(b)(2). Defendant sought extraordinary relief, arguing that the SVP provisions of Megan's Law II violated the U.S. and Pennsylvania Constitutions. The trial court granted the motion and declared the challenged provisions unconstitutional. The supreme court then ruled that the Act was constitutional and not punitive and remanded the matter to the trial court. On remand, the trial court did not hold a hearing, and in the belief that it was bound by intervening superior court precedent, held that Megan's Law II was constitutional. On appeal, the court vacated the judgment, finding that because the supreme court ordered it to do so on remand, the trial court was empowered and, indeed, required to make its own assessment of whether the Act was void for vagueness, violative of substantive due process or the separation of powers doctrine, or contained more than one subject in contravention of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order and remanded for an evidentiary hearing in accordance with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted en banc review of an order of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas (Pennsylvania) that denied petitioner arrestee approval of his Pa. R. Crim. P. 506 private complaint seeking to compel respondent Commonwealth to prosecute the local police chief for assault, reckless endangerment, and oppression. The Commonwealth argued that the arrestee lacked standing to appeal disapproval of his complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police chief allegedly roughed up the arrestee, injuring him, when detaining him after an incident in which the arrestee, as a prank, shot the chief with a squirt gun. The arrestee presented the prosecutor with a Pa. R. Crim. P. 506 private criminal complaint, which the prosecutor refused to approve. The court held that the arrestee was a person aggrieved by the decision not to prosecute and that he could seek review in the superior court as well as initial review in a common pleas court. The appeal itself, however, was unsuccessful. The standard of review for declination based on legal reasons was de novo, but for a declination based on policy reasons (or for mixed reasons), as in the instant case where the prosecutor cited unlikelihood of conviction and availability of civil remedies as reasons not to prosecute, the standard was abuse of discretion, and in the absence of any showing of bad faith, fraud, or unconstitutionality, the court would not interfere with the prosecutor's exercise of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the court held that the arrestee had standing to seek review, it nonetheless affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate's only developed claim in his appeal from an order of the Court of Common Pleas, Susquehanna County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), that denied his petition for relief under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546, was insufficiency of the evidence to support his designation as a sexually violent predator (SVP) under Pennsylvania's Megan's Law II, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9791-9799.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Instead of seeking PCRA relief from his designation as an SVP, the inmate filed a post-sentence motion for special relief. The appellate court noted that under Pennsylvania case law, it would have been entitled to treat such a motion as a PCRA motion, if only the inmate had sought review of its denial, but he had not. Instead, much later, he filed an untimely PCRA petition. By that time, the trial court had lost all jurisdiction of the matter, and there was no jurisdiction even to rule on the petition. Nonetheless, the appellate court looked to the merits of the petition as well and held that the inmate had failed to raise a cognizable claim. A claim challenging the collateral consequences of a guilty plea, as Megan's Law II consequences had been held to be, was not a proper subject of a PCRA petition. Furthermore, it appeared from the record that the evidence was ample to support the inmate's SVP designation given that the inmate's expert had not even addressed certain factors required to be addressed in making such a determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant natural parents challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Susquehanna County (Pennsylvania) compelling their cooperation with appellee Susquehanna County Services for Children and Youth (CY) for the scheduling and completion of a &quot;home visit&quot; of their residence following a child abuse referral.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court found jurisdiction to entertain CY's petition under 55 Pa. Code &sect; 3490.73 and that the Child Protective Services Law (CPSL), 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6301 et seq., and specifically 55 Pa. Code &sect; 3490.55(i), mandating a &quot;home visit&quot; at least once during the investigation period, were subject to the limits of existing Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. CY argued that the court's order did not violate the parents' Fourth Amendment rights because a home visit was required by the Department of Public Welfare's regulations and that the Fourth Amendment did not apply where the safety of children was at issue. The appeals court disagreed. The Fourth Amendment and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 applied to the CPSL and the regulations written to implement it. The only relevant facts alleged were that CY had received a Child Line referral for possible medical neglect. This was insufficient to support the court's order compelling the parents to submit to a search of their home. Nor did CY allege exigent circumstances- the court's order giving the parents 10 days to comply indicated that it was not an emergency situation where the child's life was in imminent danger.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant residuary beneficiaries of a decedent's estate sought review of the order from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Orphans' Court Division (Pennsylvania), which denied all exceptions and cross-exceptions to, and adopted and affirmed with certain exceptions, the master's findings and conclusions relative to, inter alia, the apportionment of federal taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent died in 1995, and his second wife filed a petition to apportion and pay death taxes. As administratrix, she filed her first and partial account in 2002. The decedent's son and grandson from his first marriage, as the residuary beneficiaries of the estate, filed objections. The orphan's court adopted the findings of an appointed master, who found that the marital property the wife received was not subject to death taxes and attributed federal taxes as being part of the tax apportioned to the residuary estate. The wife filed a supplemental estate tax return claiming deductions for interest that had been paid on unpaid tax obligations. The master levied the estate. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that 20 Pa. Const. Stat. &sect; 3706 was a &quot;typical&quot; apportionment statute that required that the fiduciary to pay the tax in full before seeking apportionment and contribution; however, the court found that the master followed the general rule of estate tax apportionment under 20 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3702(a) when he apportioned to the residuary beneficiaries the federal estate tax attributable to the decedent's bank account, which was attributed to the residuary estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order providing for apportionment and contribution by the residuary beneficiaries and ruled that a final determination of the federal estate tax had to be made by the federal tax officials and the federal estate tax, including interest and penalties, had to be paid in full before the beneficiaries could be required to do so. The court affirmed the finding that the bank account was properly apportioned to the beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth also argued that the parole officers had authority to enter the residence because they had reasonable suspicion that the residence contained contraband or evidence that defendant violated his parole. The appellate court concluded that entrance into the residence was illegal, and all evidence obtained after entry was subject to suppression, because when the parole officers entered the residence they did not yet have probable cause to believe that defendant resided at the residence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), which was entered on a jury verdict awarding appellees damages in an action for personal injuries. Appellants contended that the verdict was improperly recorded under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5104(b) because only nine jurors agreed with it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury returned a verdict consisting of responses to seven interrogatories. At least 10 of the 12 jurors agreed on the answer to each interrogatory, but not the same 10 agreed on every one. While all 12 agreed that appellants' negligence was a substantial factor in bringing about appellees' harm, all 12 also found appellee was contributorily negligent. Only 10 jurors agreed that appellee's contributory negligence was not a substantial factor in bringing about the harm. Ten jurors agreed on the amount of damages; however, the identities of the two dissenting jurors were not consistent. On appeal, the court held that the &quot;verdict,&quot; upon which five-sixths of the jurors had to agree, pursuant to &sect; 5104(b), was comprised of all interrogatory responses, and the verdict sheet could not be parsed so as to count the votes on each question as if it were a separable verdict. Since three jurors each voted for a different result, at least in part, on the interrogatory asking whether contributory negligence was a factor and the award of damages, the court held that the verdict was the verdict of only nine of the 12 jurors, and thus, it was not a verdict at all.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a traffic stop, the officer determined that defendant's registration had been suspended due to apparent insurance cancellation. Defendant's car was immediately impounded pursuant to a General Order of the town police department. Prior to towing, the officer conducted an inventory search and discovered illegal drugs. Defendant was convicted on drug charges. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the evidence should have been suppressed because 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6309.2 did not allow impounding and towing in the manner done in this circumstance. The court found that the statutory authority to tow a vehicle that was not properly registered contained a 24 hour grace period that allowed the owner to show that the vehicle was properly registered, which was an element that satisfied due process and prevented the Commonwealth from improperly confiscating a person's property. The court found that if given the grace period, defendant could have presented his insurance letter that showed that it was not cancelled, and the judicial authority may very well have issued a certificate of release; thus the car might not have been towed and no inventory search would have taken place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, individually and as executrix of her husband's estate, sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), which granted appellee doctor's motion for nonsuit after the trial court ruled that the executrix's expert in a wrongful death and survival action was unqualified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit alleged that the doctor was negligent in failing to follow up on the decedent's gastrointestinal symptoms and in failing to diagnose a malignancy. The trial court ruled that the executrix's expert was not qualified to testify under the provisions of the Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Act (MCARE), Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect;&nbsp;1303.512. The court vacated the trial court order. Contrary to the executrix's position, the trial court was correct in ruling that under &sect; 1303. 512(b)(2), a medical expert had have been engaged in or retired from the active practice of medicine within five years of the date he gave testimony, not within five years of the date of alleged negligence. However, the trial court erred when it completely rejected the expert's teaching activities as a basis for qualification because the expert did not teach the diagnostic technique of endoscopy. The expert was offered as a gastroenterologist, which was the doctor's specialty. Thus, &sect; 1303.512(b)(2) was satisfied if the expert was engaged in active teaching in gastroenerology. As the record could not resolve that issue, remand was necessary for reconsideration of the expert's qualifications.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order was vacated and the case was remanded for further proceedings. Based on the court's ruling, it did not address the issue of whether MCARE's expert qualification requirements were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

It was only after voir dire that intervenors sought the jurors' names. On appeal, intervenors argued First Amendment issues. The court affirmed, holding that 1) Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 afforded intervenors no greater rights than the First Amendment; 2) while the First Amendment afforded intervenors the right of access to criminal proceedings, that right did not include a right to the names and addresses of jurors; 3) neither the administrative order's requirement for keeping jury information under seal nor the use of numbers to refer to jurors constituted a closure that triggered the Press-Enterprise requirements; and 4) as the list of empaneled jurors, which included their names and addresses, was not a &quot;judicial document,&quot; no common law right of access to the list existed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant offered the 17-year-old victim a ride, bought beer for them both, and eventually had sex with him. The trial court had specifically found defendant not guilty of having corrupted a minor, but nonetheless found him guilty of luring, on grounds that it was a strict liability offense. The appellate court held that luring had never been characterized as a strict liability offense, except as to the element of harming the victim, and that the appellate court had in fact held, in a previous case, that in the absence of statutory prescription of a particular level of scienter, a showing of luring had to be accompanied by a showing of knowing, intentional, or reckless conduct. That same requirement applied to the age element of the offense. The trial court, in acquitting on the corruption charge, had indicated that the victim looked older than his years, and that same mistake of fact also precluded conviction of luring.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's conviction on the luring charge, reversed the judgment of sentence, and remanded the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of sentence entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), after a jury found him guilty of simple and aggravated assault, as well as burglary. He argued that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, that the jury instruction defining burglary was erroneous, and that the &quot;two strikes&quot; law, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim had consensual sex, followed by an evening of acrimonious encounters, at the end of which police found the victim in his apartment, with a broken deadbolt, a television thrown to the floor, and a broken ankle. The reviewing court held that despite inconsistencies in the victim's account, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the jury verdict, which was based on police accounts and physical evidence, was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. A jury charge challenge had been waived. Defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the two strikes law had focused on ex post facto concerns in the trial court, but on appeal he claimed that it denied him due process in the form of a trial by jury on sentencing issues. After agreeing to consider the issue because it concerned sentence legality, the reviewing court held that the Apprendi line of cases had no application, as the two strikes law established a statutory minimum, not a maximum. Moreover, it was based on the permissible criterion of criminal history. The Pennsylvania constitutional guarantee of trial by jury had already been determined not to apply to sentencing.</SPAN></P>

It further held that there was no equal protection violation because men and pregnant women were not similarly situated, and the statute rationally related to the state interest in protecting the lives of the unborn. The jury was properly instructed on the elements of voluntary manslaughter under the statute because the evidence supported a finding that defendant accidentally killed the fetus while killing the mother, and no legal definition of &quot;accidental&quot; was required. Defendant's confession was properly admissible in evidence because there was sufficient evidence that the victim died by foul play. Finally, defendant's statement of issues for appeal of his sentence, focused as it was on his mental illness as a mitigating factor and on his constitutional challenges that had been properly rejected, was inadequate to raise substantial issues for review.</SPAN></P>

In addition, there was sufficient evidence that defendant committed the charged sexual assault where the evidence revealed that defendant first assaulted the 16 year old victim in December 2001 and threatened to reveal her homosexual relationship to her mother if she did not do as he said. Also, there was sufficient evidence that defendant committed the charged indecent assaults where defendant engaged in an established pattern of physical and mental intimidation of the 16 year-old victim exclusively for the purpose of sexual gratification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was driving, she crossed over the double yellow lines and hit an oncoming vehicle. The impact from defendant's car caused the driver of the second car to lose control of the car. As a result, the second car crossed over and collided head on with a third vehicle, killing the third vehicle's occupants. Defendant continued driving even though her vehicle sustained significant damage. She puled off the road about one-half a mile from the accident scene. Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to convict her of the offense because there were actually two separate accidents in the case and she was only involved in the first accident. The appellate court found that the jury chose to believe the Commonwealth's version of the evidence, which showed that the collisions occurred seconds apart, in reaching the conclusion that defendant was involved in an accident that resulted in injury or death. There was sufficient evidence that defendant knew or should have known that accident involved personal injury or death. The accident took place on a clear morning on a relatively straight and flat stretch of road. The collision was severe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer stopped the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger due to the driver's failure to come to a complete stop at a stop sign. The driver was unable to produce a license and registration. A second officer approached the passenger side of the vehicle and asked the passengers, including defendant, for their names and dates of birth. After obtaining this information, the second officer checked for outstanding warrants against defendant and the passenger. The second officer learned that there was an outstanding warrant for defendant's arrest. The officer asked defendant to exit the vehicle. The officer searched defendant, finding drugs on his person. As a result, defendant was arrested and charged with drug offenses. Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search was erroneously granted. The second officer's request for defendant's name and birth date did not have to be prompted by a reasonable suspicion. Defendant did not have an expectation of privacy in his identification information. The officer's request for this information was a minimal intrusion and did not implicate Fourth Amendment or Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped at a regulatory roadblock. He advised an officer that he was not in possession of a driver's license, his vehicle registration, or proof of insurance. He was asked to pull to the side of the road where the officer noticed signs of intoxication. Defendant failed several field sobriety tests. A blood test showed that defendant was intoxicated, which led to his arrest. His motion to suppress the evidence, based in part on the constitutionality of the roadblock, was denied. The court reversed. The state supreme court had adopted guidelines for determining the constitutionality of road blocks. The findings made by the suppression court regarding those guidelines was not supported by the record. Contrary to the suppression court's finding, there was nothing in the record that showed that the roadblock was set up based on prior administrative approval. Rather, a field officer corporal made the decision and then participated in it. Prior administrative approval was required to ensure that citizens were protected from arbitrary invasions of the unfettered discretion of officers in the field. Thus, the roadblock could not pass constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was stopped and searched by police officers, the search produced a small amount of cash, a black nylon bag containing a key, and medical papers containing the name of the robbery victim. Earlier in the day, defendant, allegedly at gunpoint, took a small amount of cash and a bag from the victim. When the police apprehended defendant, the victim identified defendant. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding defendant from asking the victim, at trial, whether the victim was under the influence of drugs at the preliminary hearing. Questions about the victim's drug use at a time other than the time about which the victim was testifying was not relevant to the case. The trial court erred in sentencing defendant under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9714, because his prior conviction of attempted burglary involved a burglary as a second degree felony, which did not qualify as a strike for purposes of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9714(g). The definition of a crime of violence under &sect; 9714(g) corresponded with the description of first degree felony burglary under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial, the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County (Pennsylvania) convicted defendant of drug delivery resulting in death (third-degree murder) (18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2506), corruption of minors, abuse of a corpse, criminal conspiracy, and other related offenses. He appealed, alleging &sect; 2506 was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers discovered the body of a 16-year-old girl in a car. An autopsy revealed that she died from the adverse effects of drugs. Defendant stipulated that he provided her heroin in exchange for sex; that she took the drugs into a bathroom; that after she emerged she lost consciousness; that he tried to revive her but did not seek medical help; that he and his cousin dressed her and put heroin on her nose; and that they placed her in her car, drove it elsewhere, and abandoned it. He claimed &sect; 2506 was unconstitutionally vague on its face because it did not specify a mens rea. The appellate court disagreed. Section 2506(a) referenced third degree murder, which was defined as any killing with malice that was not first or second degree murder. In turn, malice was defined by the common law as a defendant's conscious disregard of an unjustified and extremely high risk that his actions might cause serious bodily injury. Therefore, &sect; 2506 sufficiently provided a mental state. Nor could defendant argue that the statute was vague as applied to his conduct, as his actions were clearly encompassed by &sect; 2506, which applied when one delivered an illegal drug to another who died as a result.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised many issues on appeal from a judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), after his conviction, at a bench trial, on 28 counts of sexual abuse of children by possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6312(d). He challenged the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, as well as the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that because the vast quantity of pornography on his computer included only 28 shots of children, his conviction was against the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. The appeals court, however, held that, taking into account defendant's considerable knowledge of computers, the trial court's finding of guilt was based on legally sufficient evidence and there was nothing shocking to the conscience about that finding. Defendant also argued that &sect; 6312 was unconstitutionally vague, in that the definition of nudity could cover innocent behavior, and that the statute could be interpreted as prohibiting pornographic computer-generated images. The reviewing court held that nudity defined as for the purposes of sexual gratification was perfectly clear and that the trial court plainly interpreted the statute as prohibiting only pictures of real children. Finally, merger of offenses for double jeopardy purposes had no application, as each of the 28 pictures was a separate and distinct offense.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile also argued that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2710 violated his right to freedom of speech. Specifically, the juvenile argued that the statute was overbroad, void for vagueness, and/or unconstitutional as applied. The appellate court concluded that the ethnic intimidation statute was constitutional, both on its face and as applied. The juvenile was not being punished because of his opinions; rather, he was being punished because he committed harassment and the record clearly indicated that he chose his victims because of their ethnicity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first issue considered by the court was whether, in light of the fact that defendant had counsel when he filed his pro se brief, the brief could be considered. Holding that the filing of an Anders brief left defendant essentially without counsel, the court ruled that consideration of the pro se brief was proper. The court then affirmed the trial court and permitted counsel to withdraw. In doing so, the court held that (1) the trial court properly dealt with all of the charges against defendant because many of the offenses, though not all, occurred in Clinton County; (2) defendant's minimum sentence was in accord with 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7508 and did not violate 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9756(b); (3) the refusal to merge defendant's conspiracy and corrupt organizations convictions for sentencing purposes was proper; and (4) the trial court complied with the colloquy requirements of Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised many issues on appeal from a judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County (Pennsylvania), challenging various evidentiary rulings and remarks by the prosecutor. He also challenged as excessive the imposition of consecutive sentences on 37 counts of receiving stolen property, resulting in an effective life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although Pennsylvania did not have a three strikes law, the trial court's statements in connection with imposing 37 consecutive sentences, the bulk of the many offenses of which defendant was convicted, made it clear that the trial court had given up on defendant in terms of rehabilitative potential. Although defendant had waived many of the claims he hoped to have reviewed, the appellate court ruled in his favor on two of them. First, pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. P. 703, he should have received results of a psychiatric examination in sufficient time for them to be used in preparing for his sentencing. Furthermore, in the specific context of the case, the sentence was so excessive as to be unreasonable under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9781. The 37 counts were all third-degree felonies because defendant was found to have been in the business of receiving stolen property, but his crimes were not violent and much of the property had little value. Under those circumstances, imposition of a sentence that would see defendant released, at best, at aged 100, motivated as it clearly was by the trial judge's exasperation, was an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions but vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing. It directed the trial court to assure that defendant received any reports in time to prepare for resentencing. It also directed the trial court to at least consider having some of defendant's sentences run concurrently.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which convicted him of driving under the influence (DUI), carrying a firearm without a license, and carrying a firearm on public streets/public place and sentenced him to 48 hours to one year county incarceration on the DUI conviction and three years of reporting probation on the carrying a firearm without a license conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to conduct a valid stop of his vehicle. The appellate court concluded that the facts substantiated the officer's stop of defendant's vehicle on the reasonable belief that it was being operated in a careless and erratic manner at a rate of speed in excess of the posted speed limit. In addition, the evidence was more than sufficient to prove defendant was operating his vehicle while under the influence of alcohol to a degree which rendered him incapable of safe driving where the arresting officer testified that defendant &quot;smelled like alcohol,&quot; and had bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and an overall inability to stand up. Also, the blood alcohol test was conducted at both 3:00 a.m. and 3:45 a.m., both times within three hours after defendant drove his vehicle. The blood analysis report indicated that defendant's blood alcohol content was .106 percent and .112 percent respectively, which created prima facie evidence of intoxication under 75 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3731(a)(4).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised numerous issues. The appellate court concluded that the prosecutor's use of a literary allusion did not amount to prosecutorial misconduct because the allusion was in response to defendant's closing arguments wherein he attacked the various pieces of evidence in an effort to create reasonable doubt and the prosecutor was simply responding to these attempts and using oratorical flair in order to establish a theme to which the jury could relate. The suppression court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the confession for lack of the presence of an interested adult because defendant's mother refused to come to the police station. Defendant's age did not entitle him to differential treatment in sentencing. He was tried and convicted in adult/criminal court and a life sentence imposed upon an adult following a felony murder conviction did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Defendant was not entitled to have a jury custom-tailored to suit his particular needs. He was only entitled to what he received, a jury drawn from eligible potential jurors.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), concluded that the cause of action arose in Columbia County and transferred venue there. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee injured wife received outpatient medical care from the doctors in Montour County. The injured wife and appellee husband alleged that the doctors negligently prescribed a drug, which caused the wife to suffer an allergic reaction. The wife ingested the drug while in her home in Columbia County, and suffered an allergic reaction there. On appeal, appellants argued that the trial court erred in determining that a cause of action arose in the county where the injury occurred and not the county where the alleged negligence occurred. Specifically, appellants argued that venue was proper in Montour County. The appellate court concluded that it would reach an unreasonable result if it were to affirm the trial court's decision because Pa. R. Civ. P. 1006(a.1) was a very narrow venue provision in that it provided for venue in medical professional liability actions only in the county in which the cause of action arose. Since the alleged negligent acts at issue occurred in Montour County, venue was proper there.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court was vacated, venue was transferred to Montour County, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When she escaped from prison, defendant was serving a sentence on misdemeanor charges.

On appeal, the court held that the escape charge was properly graded as a felony of the third degree. Pursuant to &sect; 5121(d)(1)(i), an escape was properly graded as a felony of the third degree if it occurred following defendant's conviction of any crime for which he had been incarcerated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), arguing that after his conviction on jury verdict of indecent assault, the trial court erred in considering the Commonwealth's motion to reconsider his sentence and in increasing that sentence after reconsideration, based on a revised assessment of his criminal history.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that the trial court had not retained jurisdiction permitting it to reconsider his original sentence, but the appellate court held that the trial court had retained jurisdiction because the Commonwealth had moved for reconsideration within 10 days after imposition of the original sentence. Nonetheless, the trial court had erred in modifying the sentence. Although a military conviction could be a prior conviction for purposes of determining an appropriate sentence, because of the special restrictions on personal behavior in the military, it could not be assumed that indecent acts under military law equated to indecent assault under Pennsylvania law. In fact, the indecent acts of which defendant was convicted appeared to have been possibly consensual homosexual contacts with a fellow soldier, acts that would not have been illegal at all in Pennsylvania. Therefore, the aggravating factor of a prior conviction should not have been applied in determining defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing in accordance with the original judgment of sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants appealed from a judgment of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania). Defendants challenged the constitutionality of the statute under which they were charged, Criminal Use of a Communications Facility, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7512, and the sufficiency of the evidence relating to each charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions were based on the use of the telephone in facilitating illegal drug transactions. Defendants' first argument was that &sect; 7512 was unconstitutional for overbreadth and vagueness. The court disagreed. Noting that &sect; 7512 did not include any explicit scienter requirement, the court referred to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 302(c) and stated that, construed in light of the language of &sect; 302(c), 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7512 was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Defendants next argued that the stipulated evidence was insufficient to sustain their convictions. The court agreed with the trial court that there was sufficient evidence to convict two defendants, but the court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction against the third defendant. As to the third defendant, the court stated that the evidence established merely that defendant engaged in drug-related telephone conversations with a known drug trafficker. Absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's conversations facilitated a specific underlying felony that was in fact carried out, the conviction could not stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the sentence of one defendant, affirmed in part the sentence of another defendant, and reversed the sentence of the third defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the father raised numerous issues. The appellate court concluded that aggravated circumstances existed as to the father pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6302 for failure to maintain any substantial and meaningful contact with his son. The few letters and phone calls that the father initiated all followed the permanency hearing where the goal was initially changed to adoption. The change of goal to adoption was in the son's best interests because no bond existed between the father and the son, but the son had bonded with his foster family and was doing very well in that placement. In addition, the father received his procedural due process rights, having had the opportunity to attend various hearings, present evidence, and cross-examine the agency's witnesses. He was also represented by an attorney. Finally, the order confirming the change of goal was proper and the grant of the petition to terminate the father's parental rights was supported by the record where the trial court found that in the six-month period prior to the filing of the termination petition the father had no contact with the son and made absolutely no attempt to perform his parental duties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents initiated a class action suit against appellee pharmaceutical companies to secure damages for personal injuries allegedly incurred by their children as a result of an injection of a vaccine, preservative, and blood product manufactured by the companies. The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), sustained the companies' preliminary objections and dismissed the parents' complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because the cause of action was cognizable under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 300aa-1 to -34. On appeal, the parents argued that the trial court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction. The appellate court found that the language of the NCVIA relative to jurisdiction was clear: a claimant's exhaustion of the NCVIA's statutory remedy was a condition precedent to subject matter jurisdiction of a state or federal court to resolve the merits of a claim filed by an individual seeking damages for a vaccine-related injury. The children were claimants and were subject to the mandate of the NCVIA requiring that an initial filing for benefits be made in the Vaccine Court. While a request for medical monitoring was a viable cause of action in Pennsylvania, the parents had to comply with the NCVIA and petition in the Vaccine Court if and when their children manifested injuries related to the ingestion of the vaccine. Thus, the parents were precluded from seeking relief in state court until they exhausted their remedies in the Vaccine Court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), entered upon his conviction of robbery, burglary, and indecent assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence that he twice burglarized and robbed the victim, an elderly neighbor, but he argued that he should not have been convicted of indecent assault in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3126, because he pinched the victim's breast only to intimidate her. The appellate court held that nonetheless, circumstantial evidence indicated a sexual component to the touching that was sufficient to support conviction. Defendant also argued that where one of the prior strikes for purposes of his enhanced sentences was part of the same criminal episode as the third strike, he should not have been subject to the three strikes law. While the appellate court applauded the logic of defendant's argument, it was bound by the plain language of the statute, which permitted enhancement. In any event, defendant could have received the same sentences even without three strikes application. Finally, federal and Pennsylvania constitutional case law suggested, and defendant failed to effectively argue the contrary, that the statute violated neither the right to jury trial nor the right to due process.</SPAN></P>

The grandmother helped to emotionally prepare the child for his mother's death. The grandmother sought partial custody and visitation rights under 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5311. Section 5311 did not violate due process. Contrary to a statute that, as applied, had been declared an unconstitutional violation of due process, &sect; 5311 only allowed grandparents to petition for visitation or custody, a parent of the child had to be deceased, the petition could only be granted if it was in the best interest of the child, and partial custody or visitation could not interfere with the parent-child relationship. Furthermore, &sect; 5311 placed the burden on the grandparents, not upon the parent. Section 5311 did not violate equal protection. To the extent that &sect; 5311 treated children who had lost a parent to death differently than children who had not, it was for the justified and reasonable purpose of protecting a child's emotional well-being and accounting for the potentially different needs of a child whose parent died.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which sentenced him to three to six years' incarceration followed by two years' probation under the applicable mandatory minimum statute,&nbsp;18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7508, for possessing a controlled substance with intent to deliver and simple possession of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that 18 Pa. Cons.

Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712(b) and 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7508(b) achieved the same end (establishing procedural requirements for imposition of mandatory minimum sentences), and used the same language regarding proof of sentencing. Thus, the caselaw upholding 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712 against challenges identical to defendant's challenges to 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7508 was conclusive as to the instant case. The procedure set forth in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712(b) did not offend the right to trial by jury enshrined in Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 6, 9. In addition, the Commonwealth plainly notified defendant that it intended to seek a mandatory minimum sentence under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7508 prior to trial, and defendant neither disputed that he received pre-trial notice nor argued how that notice was &quot;inadequate.&quot; Consequently, defendant was not entitled to relief in any case because he lacked standing to challenge the notice requirements of 18 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised 10 issues in his appeal from a judgment of sentence of the Northumberland County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), entered after his conviction of drug delivery resulting in death and various drug-related offenses. Most prominently, he challenged the consolidation of charges under two different informations as well as the constitutionality of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2506.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Survivors of a drug party in which one participant died of a heroin overdose identified defendant as having supplied the drugs. Police set up a controlled buy, obtaining a warrant to stop defendant upon his return from obtaining requested drugs, but &quot;jumped the gun&quot; and arrested him en route from his purchase when he deviated from his expected pattern of behavior. The appellate court held, first, that since defendant's drug dealing activity and the victim's death from an overdose each could have been admitted at a trial on the other charge, to show a common scheme, there was no error in consolidating the two informations. The statute criminalizing drug delivery resulting in death was not void for vagueness, because it incorporated a scienter requirement of general common law malice, and the evidence of defendant's guilt of that charge was sufficient. Exigent circumstances justified the police decision to stop defendant's drug run prematurely. Pretrial publicity was not so inflammatory as to mandate a venue change. Finally, the prosecutor's comments in closing fell within the reasonable limits of advocacy and did not require a grant of a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The doctor allegedly failed to diagnose the condition that later caused the patient to suffer a stroke. In the spouse's appellate brief, she cited a memorandum decision in support of an argument. The doctor filed a motion to strike from the brief any mention of the memorandum decision. The spouse argued that 210 Pa. Code &sect; 65.37(A), which prohibited parties from citing the appellate court's memorandum decisions, violated the vesting clause of Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 and the due course of law clause of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 11.  210 Pa. Code &sect; 65.37(A) did not violate Pa. Const. art. V, &sect; 1, which vested judicial power in the courts. Just because courts had been given judicial power, it did not have to exercise that power in every case. Given the appellate court's caseload, it would have been impossible for the appellate court to draft a detailed opinion for every case before it. The spouse waived her claim that 210 Pa.

The prisoner's fiancee had gone to the office of the clerk of the orphans' court to obtain the license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a show cause hearing, the orphans' court showed that it did not have video conferencing capabilities and had insufficient staff and funds to examine the prisoner at the prison. The prison would have allowed the prisoner to have been transported and the county sheriff would have transferred the prisoner but only if he paid all expenses, which the prisoner nor his fiancee could afford to pay. The court did not question that the prisoner had a fundamental constitutional right to marry but was unable to grant his request for mandamus to compel any official to assure the prisoner's personal appearance at the clerk's office because no statutory duty existed that required such ancillary services to have been performed by such officials. The court held that there was nothing expressed or implied in the marriage license statute,&nbsp;23 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1306, that required the clerk to visit prisons for the purpose of issuing marriage licenses and no due process or equal protection violation occurred under the facts of the case. However, the court remanded the case for the orphans' court to search for a solution to achieve the necessary face to face interview and provided suggestions.</SPAN></P>

Roadblocks were not per se unconstitutional pursuant to U.S. Const. amend IV. Similarly, roadblocks were not per se unconstitutional under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. A plurality of the supreme court had upheld the constitutionality of driving under the influence roadblocks carried out in compliance with prescribed guidelines. The supreme court had applied the rationale and guidelines of the plurality decision to a subsequent case. Although defendant presented empirical data that called into question the effectiveness of driving under the influence roadblocks, the appellate court was bound by the precedent established by the highest court in the commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by plaintiff paternal grandmother against defendants, the mother and (nominally) the father, seeking partial custody of or visitation with her grandson pursuant to 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5312, the grandmother appealed from an order of the Blair County Court of Common Pleas, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), that sustained the mother's preliminary objections based on lack of standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' custody agreement gave the mother primary custody of their child and partial custody to the father. It also contained a provision that the grandmother was not to be left in sole charge of the child when he was with his father.

The appellate court held that the grandmother had standing under the plain language of the statute, which provided standing to any grandparent once the parents had been separated for six months. Any best interests determination would have to await an evidentiary hearing. The provision in the custody agreement was just as likely to have been inserted to prevent the father from shirking his own responsibilities and leaving the child with his mother.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents, on their own behalf and on behalf of their autistic child, appealed from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), that sustained preliminary objections by defendant pharmaceutical companies to their action seeking damages for products liability and related torts, on grounds that they had failed to exhaust their federal remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The National Childhood Vaccine Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 300aa-1 to 300aa-34, provided an administrative remedy for families of children injured by vaccines. It included a strictly applied 36-month limitations period. The parents discovered the possible link between vaccines and their child's autism after the limitations period had run, so they filed an action in a Pennsylvania court. The appellate court held that according to the plain language of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 300aa-11, expiration of the limitations period did not excuse them from the requirement that they exhaust their federal remedies before proceeding in state court, even though dismissal as time-barred was virtually certain. The parents could not pursue a state court claim solely for medical expenses either, because the Act explicitly allowed recovery of such amounts. Finally, the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying an ill-conceived amendment to the parents' pleadings adding a loss of consortium claim that almost certainly would have failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from that portion of a judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), that designated him a sexually violent predator (SVP) pursuant to Pennsylvania's Megan's Law II, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9791-9799.7. He argued that expert testimony should not have been admitted without a Frye hearing, that the evidence was insufficient, and that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's SVP hearing, the State presented evidence from a psychologist who had conducted a traditional clinical assessment of him. She testified to his long-time pattern of sexually assaulting young girls, sometimes committing an assault soon after an earlier assault. She identified him as showing mental abnormality, a sexual deviance toward young girls, that made him likely to re-offend. The appellate court held, first, that while the conclusions required under Megan's Law were new, the methods used by the expert to reach them were traditional methods of assessment, and therefore not novel in the sense of requiring a Frye hearing. Furthermore, the evidence was ample to show clearly and convincingly that defendant fit the definition of an SVP. Finally, defendant's constitutional challenges had already been rejected by Pennsylvania's highest court, so the appellate court did not consider them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court had no doubt that petitioner was entitled to a new trial on grounds identical to those on which a co-defendant had been granted one. Nonetheless, due to serial ineffectiveness of various counsel, his claim was not made on direct appeal and his first, timely, PCRA petition had been dismissed for counsel's failure to file a brief. A second petition, not timely filed within the limits of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9545, sought reinstatement of petitioner's first petition. The PCRA court allowed reinstatement, allowing petitioner to file an appeal of the dismissal of the original petition. With regret, acknowledging the clear merits of petitioner's claims and that administrative practices had been changed to prevent the recurrence of petitioner's predicament, the appellate court held that it lacked jurisdiction, given the clear directives of the Commonwealth's highest court holding that the &sect; 9545 time limits were mandatory and jurisdictional, and that they could not be relaxed, even for equitable reasons. Therefore, petitioner's only remaining avenue was to seek review by that court by prerogative writ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a doctor, was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas, Luzerne County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), of Medicaid fraud (62 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A psychiatrist recommended that defendant be examined to determine if he suffered from dementia, but defendant refused such an exam. The trial court found that nothing in defendant's demeanor or conduct showed he was incompetent. The appellate court held that as counsel had a reasonable basis for not pursuing a competency hearing based on defendant's stated interest in protecting his medical license, defendant was unable to show that counsel was ineffective. The trial court did not assume a prosecutorial role by asking Commonwealth experts whether they had changed their opinions after being cross-examined. As two doctors testified that prescriptions defendant provided and the treatment he practiced were either inappropriate or below accepted medical standards, and a patient testified defendant provided him with drugs on request, defendant's conviction of violating Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 780-113(a)(14) was supported by sufficient evidence. The trial court properly imposed a mandatory sentence under 18 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pennsylvania's Megan's Law, as amended, placed the burden on the Commonwealth to show by clear and convincing evidence that a person convicted of sex offenses fell within the definition of &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; set forth at 42 Pa.

The reviewing court noted that the Commonwealth's expert (who had not been allowed an opportunity to personally interview defendant, due to defendant's refusal to meet with him), had testified merely to the likelihood of re-offending based on statistics. Moreover, many of the determinative factors listed at 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9795.4(b) actually weighed against classification of defendant as a sexually violent offender. Under the circumstances, the evidence was simply inadequate.</SPAN></P>

The terms &quot;sexually violent predator,&quot; &quot;personality disorder,&quot; &quot;mental abnormality,&quot; and &quot;likely to engage in&quot; were not impermissibly vague. Defendant did not demonstrate that he was in danger of incriminating himself of a crime during his evaluation by the State Sexual Offenders Assessment Board. The trial court did not violate defendant's right to have a &quot;trial&quot; initiated by indictment when he was assessed pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9795.4 because the assessment was not a &quot;trial.&quot; Defendant's double jeopardy argument was without merit because a Megan's Law II hearing did not constitute a second trial. Megan's Law II did not violate the Pennsylvania Constitution by granting adjudicative powers to the Board because the Board dictated no specific conclusion to the judiciary. Finally, Megan's Law II did not violate Pa. Const. art. 3, &sect; 3 because the law contained only one subject matter, i.e., the registration of sexual offenders.</SPAN></P>

The insured sought recovery under the underinsured motorist (UIM) portion of her policy. The insurer denied her underinsured motorist claim, citing a lack of causation. The insurer had previously found causation and had paid the insured's claims for first-party medical benefits. The UIM issue went to arbitration where the insured was awarded an amount well in excess of the UIM coverage. Although the parties settled the UIM issue, the insured filed her bad faith action. The trial court found bad faith and made 169 findings of fact in support of its ruling. The court affirmed, holding that (1) the insurer's conduct during the course of the bad faith litigation was properly considered by the trial court in finding bad faith; (2) there was no point of law raised in the case upon which the insurer could rely to preclude a bad faith showing; (3) the evidence supported the finding of bad faith; (4) punitive damages could be awarded under &sect; 8371 based simply on a finding of bad faith; and (5) the size of the punitive damage award was appropriate under Pennsylvania law and did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that defendant was an SVP despite a Sexual Offenders Assessment Board determination to the contrary. The appellate court noted that, in determining whether a defendant was an SVP, expert testimony as to the presence of a mental defect/disorder was required. The Commonwealth produced no such proof; in fact, an assessor from the Board found that a diagnosis of defendant as having paraphilia narcissistic traits was unfounded. That the trial court gave no credence to this report did not mean the Commonwealth produced the requisite clear and convincing evidence of defendant's SVP status. Having disposed of the appeal on other grounds, the appellate court did not reach defendant's constitutional challenges.</SPAN></P>

The State Sexual Offenders Assessment Board assessed defendant, and a Board member testified that defendant met the SVP criteria of Megan's Law II. The appellate court held that the Commonwealth could appeal the denial of SVP status, as such an appeal did not subject defendant to multiple punishments in violation of the double jeopardy clause. The trial court properly considered the factors of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. An. &sect; 9795.4(b), and found that (1) defendant's criminal history was non-sexual in nature, except for the instant conviction; (2) defendant suffered from an anti-social personality disorder, but this disorder did not make him likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses; (3) defendant's sole sexual offense was not violent; (4) there was a single victim; (5) the victim was not a child, but was old enough to resist the assault. That the Board member believed defendant was likely to re-offend, and the trial court found him to be credible, was, by itself, not conclusive.</SPAN></P>

The legislative act providing for the installation of ignition interlock systems did not violate Pa. Const. art.

That act was entitled &quot;An Act amending Title 42 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, providing for the use of ignition interlock systems and for restitution of identity theft.&quot; The act's title clearly expressed its subject matter. Although the act imposed different consequences for two discrete offenses, its provisions were properly related and germane to a single general purpose, which was precise criminal sanctions. Therefore, the act did not violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 3, and the entire act did not have to be set aside.</SPAN></P>

Defendant two did not appear at trial and the jury returned a verdict solely against her. The passengers' post-trial relief motion was deemed denied by operation of law, and the passengers appealed, contending that the trial court erred in not allowing them to establish that defendant one was negligent for disregarding defendant two's turn signal. The court found that the trial court had erroneously interpreted Pa. R. Civ. P. 2255(c), in that it held that the admissions by default of defendant two, that her signal was not used, were binding against the passengers. As the passengers did not share identity of legal interests with defendant two, the trial court erred by binding them to her admissions.

The court found that defendant's due process challenges to the Act lacked merit, in that the registration, notification, and counseling provisions were non-punitive and accordingly, the adjudication was not an &quot;enhanced punishment.&quot; The definition of &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. There was no violation of the separation of powers under Pa. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5, in that the Board did not perform an adjudicative function.

Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7002(b), 7003(1), and 7003(5) were found to be unconstitutional by the supreme court, because they violated the doctrine of separation of powers. Those provisions delegated to the judiciary the executive function necessary to effectuate the issuance of an interlock restricted license. The appellate court in the instant case found that because the portions of Act 63 that required the trial court to order the installation of the ignition interlock system, verify compliance, and certify the installation to the department of transportation were found unconstitutional, the appellate court was obligated to correct the sentence imposed upon defendant. The appellate court relied upon its authority to directly amend a sentence to amend the illegal sentence imposed upon defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of sentence was vacated insofar as it imposed upon defendant the requirement that he install an ignition interlock system. The judgment of sentence was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The LTSU was the most restrictive prison unit designed to house the &quot;most problematic&quot; inmates, and the trial court had found that, although the conditions were unpleasant, the basic requirements of life were met. The court first held that although the inmates had been transferred from the LTSU, the court would still hear the appeal because the inmates could be returned to the LTSU and other prisoners remained there; thus, the issue was capable of repetition. However, after reviewing the record of the trial court, the court concluded that the conditions complained of did not show that they either alone or in combination with other conditions, deprived the inmates of the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities, or at least a single, identifiable human need. The inmates failed to carry their burden of proving that their conditions of confinement in the LTSU were cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgments of sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, following his guilty pleas for forgery and indecent assault, and from the trial court's determination that he was a sexually violent predator (SVP) pursuant to Pennsylvania's Megan's Law II, 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his SVP designation. The appellate court found that the evidence clearly and convincingly supported the SVP designation. Defendant's substance abuse lowered his inhibitions and provided an opportunity for him to act out abnormal sexual urges, defendant molested his daughter a series of times, and defendant's sexual abuse of a family member increased his risk of recidivism. Megan's Law II's registration, notification, and counseling provisions did not violate defendant's right to a jury trial, as they did not impose additional criminal punishment. Further, Megan's Law II did not violate defendant's procedural due process rights in failing to provide a means for future reassessment, as given the specific legislative finding that SVPs posed a high risk of recidivism and given the lack of information concerning the prospect of successful treatment of SVPs, defendant failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality of the statute. Finally, Megan's Law II did not violate substantive due process, as defendant was not subject to confinement under the registration, notification, and counseling provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. The appellate court held that defendant intended to commit a statutory sexual assault. Defendant thought that the intended victim was a 15-year-old child (actually the victim was a police officer posing as a young girl on the Internet), knew that he was more than four years older than the victim, and intended to engage in sexual intercourse per os with her. The same evidence supported the attempted involuntary deviate sexual intercourse conviction. Further, defendant intended to engage in oral intercourse with the victim, and rented a motel room, purchased wine and condoms, packed an overnight bag, and drove from Pittsburgh to Tionesta in order to meet the victim. Defendant could not invoke a renunciation defense. The appellate court refused to hold that public policy required the elimination of sting operations. The conduct of the police was not so egregious as to constitute entrapment. Finally, defendant's 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 905(b) claim was waived due to the failure to timely file a concise statement of matters complained of on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the inmate's guilty plea was entered, he underwent an assessment by the Pennsylvania Sexual Offender's Assessment Board, whereupon he was declared a sexually violent predator.

The appellate court upheld the constitutionality of the Act, noting that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had upheld the Act's constitutionality as to the registration, notification, and counseling requirements, as they were not deemed to be punitive in nature. The appellate court held that appellant's constitutional challenge which hinged on the underlying assumption that those provisions of the Act constituted criminal punishment and therefore, violated due process, lacked merit. The definition of &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague, the Act did not usurp the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's rule-making power for all courts, and it did not violate the single-subject rule of Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), entered upon his conviction after a bench trial of assault and related charges arising out of a shooting incident. On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712, under which he had received mandatory minimum sentences for crimes committed with a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Citing only to the Pennsylvania Constitution in his appeal, defendant argued that the mandatory sentencing statute violated the jury trial guarantee of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 and the due process guarantee of Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The appellate court noted, first, that federal and Pennsylvania case law had consistently held that the use of a firearm was simply a sentencing trigger, not an element of the offenses of which defendant had been convicted. Therefore, it did not have to be separately determined by a jury under the Apprendi rule. It was also already settled law in Pennsylvania that the preponderance of the evidence standard used in determining whether the trigger had been proven did not violate due process. Finally, defendant lacked standing to challenge the sentencing statute's notice provisions, since it was clear from the record that he received plenty of notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer, while pushing her infant in a cart, hit an unseen raised manhole cover in the retailer's parking lot. The infant sustained minor injuries and her claim was settled. The mother sustained knee injuries and underwent treatment. A jury held for the customer and the retailer filed post-trial motions, but later learned that the trial judge had retired. The newly assigned judge prepared an opinion that was considered an advisory opinion and the retailer appealed. On appeal, the court held that Pa. R. Civ. P. 227.4(1)(b) was constitutionally applied and did not deprive the retailer of the right to due process. Although the retailer's interest was important, its proposed safeguard would not have been of any value and there was a governmental interest in promoting the parties' ability to appeal. Moreover, the retailer failed to comply with Pa. R. App. P. 522. The court considered various contentions as to allegedly improper rulings by the trial court and found them lacking. However, the court held that the award of $ 1 million was against the weight of the evidence given the extent of the customer's injuries, her limited medical bills, and her failure to claim wage loss.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the Pennsylvania Tender Years Statute (TYS), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5985.1. The appellate court held that although the TYS was too recent to be a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, it required that the evidence be proven admissible by particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. Thus, the statute was constitutional insofar as it did not violate defendant's right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment or Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Further, the statute was not an unconstitutional violation of defendant's right to compulsory process, as a hearing and an individualized determination of competence were required before finding a witness unavailable. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the victim was unavailable to testify. The victim's statements to various persons were not inadmissible hearsay. Defendant was not prevented from cross-examining the nurse who took DNA samples from him. Defendant's alibi witnesses were properly excluded, as defendant failed to properly notice the witnesses. The evidence was sufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant health care providers appealed the order of the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, Civil Division (Pennsylvania), finding that the health care providers were delinquent in making payment under a settlement agreement with plaintiff estate administrator and that the administrator was, therefore, entitled to a Pa. R. Civ. P. 229.1 award of sanctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator settled her medical malpractice action that she filed against the providers. The administrator filed an affidavit under Philadelphia County, Pa., C.P. Ct. R. 229.1 for sanctions resulting from the providers' failure to deliver settlement funds. The language in the settlement and release agreement providing that each party was to bear its own counsel fees and costs did not effectuate a waiver of Philadelphia County, Pa., C.P. Ct. R. 229.1. The language in the settlement agreement dealing with counsel fees and costs clearly did not contemplate an after-the-fact enforcement proceeding. Furthermore, no waiver was effectuated, as the counsel fees and costs language did not specifically refer to Philadelphia County, Pa., C.P. Ct. R. 229.1. The trial court had authority to adopt Philadelphia County, Pa., C.P. Ct. R. 229.1, as the rule did not conflict with a statewide procedural rule or statute. Philadelphia County, Pa., C.P. Ct. R. 229.1 did not violate due process, in part, because the provision for allowing the delinquent party to file an answer to the petition for sanctions was sufficient to allow the providers an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held the case was contemplated by Pa. R. Civ. P. 1006(a.1), providing that a medical professional liability action was to be brought only in the county in which the claim arose. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's order amending Pa. R. Civ. P. 1006 to contain this provision showed it applied to actions filed on or after January 1, 2002, so it applied to the instant case. The administratrix's argument that the amendment was unconstitutional merely stated that the amendment was unconstitutional and conflicted with Pa. R. Civ. P. 152, so it was waived. The providers did not waive venue by not filing preliminary objections within 20 days, under Pa. R. Civ. P. 1026(a), or even 90 days as permitted by the order amending Pa. R. Civ. P. 1006, as the administratrix was not prejudiced. As the administratrix did not allege the providers' delay affected her ability to present factual information at trial or in opposition to their venue challenge, the preliminary objections were properly accepted. The providers did not waive venue by participating in the case pending the trial court's ruling on their venue challenges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a judgment of sentence entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), after he was convicted of violating the Pennsylvania Hit-and-Run Act, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3741-3755, defendant argued that he had substantially complied with the Act, that the Act violated his self-incrimination privilege, and that his sentence violated sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant believed he had hit a garbage bag on the highway, but later returned and found the victim's body. He reported the accident anonymously, but did not come forward with full information about himself and the fact that he was the driver until several days later. The appellate court agreed that defendant failed to establish a defense of substantial compliance, a defense sometimes recognized in case law under the Act, since it was clear that his hesitation in turning himself in was entirely due to fear of prosecution, not to doubt about whether he had hit the victim. The appellate court went on to find that defendant's guarantees against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 had not been violated by the application of the stopping and reporting requirements of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3742 and 3744, because the requirements were a reasonable exercise of the police power to protect public safety by encouraging prompt reporting and rescue as well as financial responsibility. Finally, there was no impropriety in the trial court's having considered defendant's four-day delay, along with other factors, in determining to impose an enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer, traveling behind defendant's vehicle, ran a National Crime Information Center (NCIC) search on the vehicle, which indicated that the vehicle, though registered, lacked the proper financial responsibility as required by 75 Pa.

The appellate court held that since NCIC reports could form the basis of probable cause, the officer had sufficient probable cause to stop defendant. Therefore, the trial court properly determined that the stop was legal pursuant to 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6308(b). There was no need to evaluate whether the officer was engaged in a systematic program of vehicle and driver checks. There was no need for some level of suspicion to check a license plate that was clearly in plain view.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover detective went into appellant's clothing store on several occasions and purchased baggies and inositol, which was used for adulterating cocaine, with the store manager's assistance. Thereafter, a search warrant was executed at the store, resulting in seizure of inositol, mannitol, and baggies. Appellant was charged and entered a plea of nolo contendre, although her motion to withdraw her guilty plea was granted. After trial, she was convicted of various charges and sentenced to various terms of probation, to be served concurrently. The appellate court quashed the Commonwealth's appeal because it was not an aggrieved party and because there was no merit to its appeal. The court held that specific intent was not a required element of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 35, &sect; 108-113(a)(33), and that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction based on a showing of appellant's knowledge of the intended use of the paraphernalia. However, her conviction under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 911 was vacated because she was not the type of criminal, nor had she engaged in such conduct, which was the focus of that crime.</SPAN></P>

The lease was executed by the property management agent acting on behalf of the landlord. The guarantors signed an agreement guaranteeing the retail store's obligations under the lease. The store executed a lease amendment in 1996 extending the lease another five years. No new guaranty agreement was signed. The store defaulted. The agent confessed judgment against the store for the default. The agent then sued the guarantors. The trial court ruled that the guaranty agreement covered the lease extension. The amendment of the lease constituted a material modification of the original lease that substantially increased the guarantors' risk. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the agent, as the agreement was ambiguous as to whether the guarantors agreed to guarantee material changes in the lease that increased their risk. The agent's confessed judgment was properly not given preclusive effect regarding the issue of damages against the guarantors. Because of the agent's confessed judgment, the guarantors had no right to defend the issue. Therefore, the confessed judgment was not binding.</SPAN></P>

The sexual encounter occurred when defendant, while off duty, saw the inmate going to her work-release job and offered her a ride in his car. On appeal, defendant argued that former 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3124.2 was unconstitutional. The appellate court ruled that a statute was void for vagueness only if it failed to define unlawful conduct with sufficient definiteness so that ordinary people understood what conduct was prohibited. Any person of reasonable intelligence should have known and understood the terms &quot;inmate&quot; and &quot;employee or agent of the department of corrections or county correctional authority&quot; as used in former 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3124.2. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague. No First Amendment right was implicated, so the statute was not overbroad. A statute did not violate constitutional safeguards merely because there was a doubt as to its applicability in regard to cases that may never have arisen. There was enough evidence to infer that defendant knew the victim was on work release and an inmate when he committed the sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of sentence of the York County Common Pleas Court, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), entered after his convictions on guilty plea to charges of sex offenses against a child and other offenses, and from the trial court's reliance on a report of the Pennsylvania Sexual Offender Assessment Board in determining that he was a sexually violent predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an adult accused of offenses against a six-year-old girl, had been adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile for offenses involving another six-year-old girl. The appellate court held that, construed in harmony as statutes in pari materia, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9795.4 created an exception to the rules of general confidentiality of juvenile records, set forth at 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6307, allowing those materials not specifically protected by the psychotherapist-patient privilege of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5944 to be considered in determining whether a person convicted of a sex offense should be subject to the Pennsylvania Registration of Sexual Offenders Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9791-9799. Since the trial court had not determined which of the diagnostic and other psychiatric records considered by the Board in fact implicated disclosures made by defendant as a juvenile patient, that issue would have to be explored on remand.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to consecutive periods of incarceration of two to five years for each count.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.

The appellate court concluded that there was no authority to support defendant's suggestion that an adult could take pornographic pictures of a minor, if the minor consented.  18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6312 was protective in purpose, and no one could legally take pornographic photographs of a minor, regardless of whether the minor consented. Defendant's relationship with the victim was no excuse for his behavior. In addition, the issues regarding the discretionary aspects of defendant's sentence were waived, as defendant failed to include them in his Pa. R. App. P. 1925(b) statement. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the sentences should not merge, because defendant photographed the victim over 60 times in sexually explicit poses, despite the fact she was under the age of 18.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised several issues on appeal. First, he argued that the arresting officer lacked reasonable and articulable grounds upon which to believe defendant violated the traffic control device provisions of the Motor Vehicle Code (MVC). The reviewing court found that when the officer observed defendant drive through a red light, it was established that the officer had a reasonable and articulable basis upon which to justify the stop and detention. Defendant argued that the Commonwealth failed to carry its burden of establishing the admissibility of his blood alcohol content since the police failed to observe defendant for 20 minutes prior to administration of the breathalyzer test as required by 67 Pa. Code &sect; 77.24(a). The Commonwealth established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the officers sufficiently observed defendant for the 20 minutes prior to the test, in compliance with the regulation. Defendant also attacked the reliability of breathalyzer devices. The court held that the breathalyzer models approved for use in Pennsylvania were subjected to rigorous laboratory testing and state regulations mandating detailed calibration and accuracy procedures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried before a district magistrate who found him guilty of violating a municipal anti-loitering ordinance. Defendant pursued an appeal, and a trial de novo was conducted. The Court of Common Pleas of York County (Pennsylvania) found defendant guilty, and entered a judgment of sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed in a high drug area, holding currency in his hand.

The other individual dropped a clear plastic zip-lock bag with an off-white substance. When defendant was subsequently observed standing on a sidewalk, still holding money in his hand, he was arrested for committing acts demonstrating an intent or desire to enter into a drug transaction. The appellate court noted that defendant was not convicted of possessing contraband substances, nor was he observed possessing any contraband substances. Rather, he was observed standing on a public sidewalk holding currency in his right hand. The off-white substance in the discarded plastic baggie was not crack cocaine. The appellate court found that the anti-loitering ordinance was vague, because it impermissibly delegated basic policy matters to police officers for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis. It was overbroad, by proscribing and punishing constitutionally protected activities such as &quot;hanging around&quot; and &quot;sauntering.&quot; The ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery and criminal conspiracy, and was sentenced to 25 to 50 years' imprisonment. On direct appeal, the judgment was affirmed. Thereafter, defendant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9541- 9546.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced pursuant to the provision of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714 which called for an increased penalty when a defendant had previously been convicted of two or more crimes of violence. Defendant argued that the Commonwealth failed to prove that his prior conviction for conspiracy constituted a crime of violence, and other errors.  42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9714(g) defined aggravated assault as defined in 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2702(a)(1) or (2), or criminal conspiracy to commit any of the offenses listed. In the earlier action, defendant was charged with aggravated assault and conspiracy under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2702(a)(4). The Commonwealth added a charge of aggravated assault under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2702(a)(1). However, as part of a plea bargain the Commonwealth withdrew both counts of aggravated assault. The appellate court's review of the record did not reveal any evidence from which the sentencing court could have concluded that defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to commit aggravated assault under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2702(a)(1), or, as the sentencing court concluded, that the one count of conspiracy encompassed both underlying aggravated assault counts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the bank had obtained judgment by confession, the guarantor, the borrower, and the bank executed an agreement that forgave part of the debt and set out a payment schedule. When the borrower and the guarantor missed payments due, the bank sought a writ of execution. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in ruling that the guarantor's petition to open was untimely for having been filed almost six years after the confession of judgment. Because the procedures for executions upon confessed judgments extant in 1996 violated due process, new rules were adopted that year, including Pa. R. Civ. P. 2958.3, which gave the guarantor 30 days after notice of execution to file the petition to open. That rule should have been applied retroactively; further, under the First Seneca rule, as the guarantor did not &quot;sleep on the case,&quot; but was negotiating during the six years, his petition to open was not tardy. But the guarantor's failure to assert a meritorious defense, and his unclean hands, due to sale of collateral and false financial statements, justified the trial court's denial of relief. Finally, he was not entitled to equitable accounting under Pa. R. Civ. P. 1530.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court should not have imposed a term of imprisonment outside and above the ranges of the sentencing guidelines. Defendant also argued that he was entitled to have a jury determine whether he committed the prior offenses considered by the trial court when it imposed a discretionary sentencing enhancement that doubled the term of imprisonment. The appellate court concluded that defendant failed to substantiate that the trial court was unaware of the guidelines' ranges. The trial court both possessed and explicitly noted that it had considered the pre-sentence report. There was no indication that the trial court was unaware of, or ignored, any of the mitigating evidence. In addition, defendant was not entitled to have a jury determine whether he was a recidivist. Neither statutory nor case law supported the conclusion that a prior conviction for possession with intent to deliver somehow became an element of subsequent charges with that offense. The enhanced sentence was double the sentence that otherwise would have applied to the crime of possession with intent to deliver based solely on the existence of defendant's prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded that the trial court properly conducted a detailed analysis focusing on the children's best interests when granting partial physical custody to the grandparents, and the custody order did not interfere with the father's legal custody. The record revealed a long-term, close-knit relationship between the children and the grandparents. The grandparents clearly demonstrated to the trial court that the children's best interests would be well served by granting them partial custody. The custody order was not excessive in light of the close, loving relationship the children had with the grandparents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's indecent assault related to oral sex in June 1999 involving a 10-year-old boy in whose house defendant was then residing. Megan's Law II was adopted effective July 2000 to correct Megan's Law I's unconstitutional process of SVP determinations. Under Megan's Law II, inter alia, a member of the assessment board had to conduct an assessment pursuant to, and include an examination of factors in, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9795.4(b). The trial court was then to hold a hearing that provided a defendant with procedural protections. The Commonwealth had to prove SVP status by clear and convincing evidence. The trial court stated the member's testimony was credible but did not detail its finding of factors. The superior court conducted plenary review of the record to conclude that there was not clear and convincing evidence of the statutory factors and a number of the statutory factors weighed against a SVP classification: the offense did not involve multiple victims, there was no evidence of force or cruelty, it was defendant's first sexual offense, and defendant's prior criminal history was non-sexual. The superior court did not have to address constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to a term of two to four years in prison. On appeal, defendant claimed that the mandatory sentencing scheme created under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6317 violated due process and constitutional guarantees of notice and jury trial. Defendant asserted that the essential element of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 6317(b), delivery within 1,000 feet of school property, constituted an element of the aggravated offense. Therefore, it had to be charged in the information, submitted to the jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The information did not need to allege a drug sale within 1,000 feet of a school, as it was not an essential element of the offense of possession with intent to deliver. Whether defendant violated &sect; 6317(b) did not need to be submitted to the jury under Apprendi, because defendant received less than the statutory maximum sentence of 15 years for the crime.</SPAN></P>

The trial court imposed an aggregate sentence of 77 to 154 months' incarceration. Defendant appealed the judgment of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a confrontation with his former girlfriend and her new boyfriend. During the incident, defendant pointed a gun at the boyfriend's face. Shots were subsequently fired, one of which entered the boyfriend's car, narrowly missing the former girlfriend, who was sitting in the back seat. The appellate court held the evidence was sufficient to support the aggravated assault convictions. It could be inferred that defendant, who was an expert marksman, intended to cause serious bodily injury to the former girlfriend because the bullet he fired missed her by only three inches. Testimony indicated that when the victims were running for safety, defendant continued to shoot in their direction. This conduct evidenced defendant's intent to cause them serious bodily injury. The appellate court affirmed the remainder of the convictions. However, the appellate court held defendant was entitled to 18 days' credit for time he spent under house arrest. While the case was on appeal, the state supreme court had held that a home confinement/electronic monitoring program constituted time spent in custody for purposes of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9760.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck a pedestrian, but believed, and stated on his insurance claim, that he struck a sign at a different location, did not stop after, or report, the accident to authorities, denied to others that he was involved in the accident, and fixed up and traded his car. The pedestrian died from the injuries he received. There was no guilty plea sentence agreement. The superior court, inter alia, decided the following issues. The common pleas judge did not abuse his discretion (1) by not recusing himself, as the judge's newspaper interview and post-sentence opinion did not establish bias or prejudice, and a purported violation of Pa. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 3A(6) did not necessitate recusal, and (2) by imposing a sentence for insurance fraud and tampering with evidence, consecutive sentences, and a total sentence of two to four years of incarceration. The judge's reasoned opinion considered the general sentencing principles of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 42, &sect; 9721(b), which included an assessment of defendant's attempts to cover up, flirt with truth of, and deny responsibility for, the accident, as related to his rehabilitative needs, and mandatory minimum sentences.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also challenged as violative of equal protection, a claim reviewed under identical standards under Pennsylvania and federal constitutional law, the requirement at 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7003 that conditioned issuance of a restricted driver's license on her installation of an ignition interlock device into which she would have to breathe in order to start her car. Since the law did not involve suspect classifications or sensitive interests, the reviewing court applied a rational basis test, and held that the statute rationally related to the Commonwealth's interest in protecting motorists.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to one count of corrupt organizations. No direct appeal was filed. Defendant's first petition, under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9541 et seq., was denied, but his second petition was granted, by order of the Court of Common Pleas of York County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), which vacated his judgment of sentence. The Commonwealth appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispositive issue, on appeal, was the timeliness of defendant's PCRA petition. Because defendant was convicted in 1989, he had until January 16, 1997 to file his petition. The appellate court found the second petition, filed on December 8, 1999, was manifestly untimely. The trial court excused the untimely filing, under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9545(b)(1)(iii), which allowed an exception for newly recognized constitutional rights. Defendant claimed there was a new case, which announced a new constitutional right. In such cases, a petition had to be filed within 60 days, under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9545(b)(2). The trial court extended the 60 days because defendant claimed he did not know about the new case in time. He presented a letter from his correctional facility, stating the new case had been received at the facility on December 22, 1999. The appellate court found that defendant's lack of awareness of the decision did not excuse the failure to file within 60 days, as neither the court system nor the correctional system was obliged to educate or update prisoners concerning case law changes. Because it was untimely, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order granting postconviction relief was vacated and defendant's judgment of sentence was reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant media members appealed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County (Pennsylvania) denying the media members' petition to vacate or modify a restraining order precluding certain extrajudicial statements. The order also denied the media members access to the Commonwealth brief filed after defense counsel moved to quash a notice of aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying criminal matter which gave rise to the suit involved a double murder committed by two defendants, one of whom was a minor. In both instances, the Commonwealth filed a notice of aggravating circumstances, indicating its intention to seek the death penalty. The question then arose whether, because of the minor's age at the time of the murder, the death penalty was applicable. Briefs were ordered by the court for use in its deliberations on the question. At the same time, the restraining order was entered. The appellate court found that because the trial court denied not only the media members' petition to vacate or modify the restraining order, but it also denied the media members' petition to intervene, the media members were required to argue on appeal that the trial court erred in failing to grant them intervenor status. In failing to do so, they waived the issue. The media members had no alternative source of standing to challenge the restraining order, because they lacked a substantial, direct, or immediate interest in the subject matter of the litigation. The trial court properly denied access to the brief, because the brief was not a public record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) convicted defendant of robbery, attempted theft, and possession of an instrument of crime, and sentenced defendant according to the Pennsylvania Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Statute (PMMSS), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9712. Defendant appealed, arguing that the sentence was illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that an illegal sentence was one that exceeded the statutory limits and therefore was one which the court had no jurisdiction to impose. Because there was no dispute that defendant's sentence was within statutory limits, or that the trial court had jurisdiction to enter such sentences, defendant's challenge did not go to the legality of the sentence. Rather, it was a challenge to the discretionary aspects of sentencing. The appellate court held that to reach the merits of a discretionary sentencing issue, it was required to determine (1) whether defendant filed a timely notice of appeal, (2) whether the issue was properly preserved at sentencing or in a motion to reconsider and modify sentence, Pa. R. Crim. P. 720, (3) whether defendant's brief had a fatal defect, Pa. R. App. P. 2119(f), and (4) whether there was a substantial question that the sentence was inappropriate. The appellate court held defendant did not file a post-sentence motion challenging his sentence or object to the sentence during the sentencing hearing. Because defendant never provided the trial judge with the opportunity to reconsider or modify the sentence, the issue was waived.</SPAN></P>

For the same reason, that the child never got into the car, he challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. The appeals court upheld defendant's conviction. Prior case law construing the statute established that it was intended to constitute an inchoate offense, to prevent commission of crimes such as kidnapping, unlawful restraint, and sexual abuse of children. The words &quot;into the car&quot; simply described the illegal object sought by the unlawful conduct; a child did not have to enter the car for the offense to occur.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal the trial court erred in failing to merge the charge of corruption of minors with that of indecent assault for sentencing purposes. The appellate court noted that to be convicted of indecent assault, it must be shown an individual had indecent contact with the victim. However, the individual was guilty of corruption of minors if they performed any act that corrupted or tended to corrupt the morals of any child under the age of 18. Therefore, the appellate court advised a corruption of minors charge encompassed any such act, the consequence of which transcended any specific sex act, and was separately punishable. Accordingly, the appellate court concluded that corruption of minors was not a lesser included offense of indecent assault and the offenses did not merge for sentencing purposes. In addition, the appellate court found further analysis into the facts did not compel a different determination. The appellate court reasoned the charges of indecent assault and corruption of minors were based on separate and distinct conduct, and as such, the trial court did not err in failing to merge the convictions for sentencing purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury in the Court of Common Pleas, Adams County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), convicted defendant of aggravated harassment by a prisoner. At the commencement of trial, defendant moved for sequestration of two witnesses. The trial court sequestered the witnesses during their testimony but allowed the witnesses to listen to the opening statements. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the crime of aggravated harassment by a prisoner, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2703.1, was unconstitutional, and that there was no rational relationship between inmates, the class whose conduct the statute sought to control, and the legislative goal. The appellate court held that a statute whose classification did not involve a fundamental right or a suspect class did not violate the Equal Protection Clause if there was a rational relationship between the discrimination and a valid governmental matter. A rational basis analysis did not require a court to find an explanation as to why inmates and free persons were punished differently for the same offense. The deterrent effect an increased punishment could have on an inmate's conduct constituted a rational basis. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in its sequestration order. However, the appellate court found that at trial, defendant requested that each witness be absent only during the other's testimony and did not ask that the witnesses be removed during opening statements. Defendant's motion was granted as it was requested.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, age 18, had consensual intercourse with the victim, age 12. Defendant believed she was 16. On appeal, defendant argued that, to the extent 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3121(a)(6) did not require the offender know the victim was under 13 and did not permit mistake of age as a defense, the statute was unconstitutional. He further claimed the imposition of a prison sentence for a crime which did not require a culpable mental state was also unconstitutional. The appellate court held that although due process considerations imposed some limitations on the absence of a knowledge requirement from a criminal offense, due process did not require that an accused be afforded the defense of mistake of the victim's age in a statutory rape case. The legislature could rationally require that one 18 years of age or older who engaged in sexual intercourse with a child below 14 years of age did so at his own peril. Although a culpable mental state was generally required before criminal sanctions could be imposed, exceptions included sex offenses, such as rape, in which the victim's actual age was determinative despite defendant's reasonable belief that the girl had reached age of consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the juvenile argued that: (1) the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress physical evidence because he matched the description broadcast over the police radio where there was no evidence introduced concerning his description, and (2) the trial court erred when it ruled that the description, coupled with his flight, provided the police with a reasonable suspicion to chase him and when it refused to suppress contraband discarded during the chase. Upon review, the appellate court reversed and remanded the judgment. The Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence that the officer possessed reasonable suspicion to detain the juvenile. Rather, the trial court's legal conclusion was based upon a fact not introduced into evidence. The juvenile's unprovoked flight in combination with his &quot;partially fitting&quot; a vague description of a robbery suspect did not give rise to reasonable suspicion, especially when the Commonwealth failed to present any evidence regarding the juvenile's proximity to the site or time of the robbery, the basis of the information supplied to the officer or any other suspicious activity on the part of the juvenile.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's original trial, State was allowed to introduce the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who was unavailable at trial. That order was affirmed. Later, on appeal of the denial of defendant's federal habeas corpus petition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that defendant was entitled to a new trial as the witness was not legally unavailable, but explicitly declined to address whether there had been a full and fair opportunity to cross examine. In the interim, the witness died. At the retrial, State again tried to introduce the preliminary hearing testimony. The dead witness was unavailable, but the trial court found that defendant had not been given a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine as he did not have access to his witness statement, criminal history or his testimony agreement with State. The appellate court held that, under the law of the case doctrine, since the trial court decided against defendant on the issue of opportunity to cross examine at the first trial, it was without authority to reconsider the issue at the retrial. The trial court had reopened an issue that had already been decided and affirmed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Since the child was 4 months-old, and living with grandmother, appellant had lived at 13 separate addresses, and father resided primarily in prison.

When the child was four, grandmother sought primary legal and physical custody. The trial court granted grandmother permission to visit Alabama, and later the trial court granted primary legal and physical custody to grandmother and permitted grandmother to relocate to Alabama, where her family lived; appellant challenged. The court affirmed. The trial court properly applied the presumption that appellant, the biological parent, had a prima facie right to custody and that grandmother had a heavy burden of production and persuasion; she carried both and the scale came down hard on her side. The trial court's findings of fact were supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile who was adjudicated delinquent and placed in a treatment center following his admission to assault and terroristic threats, filed an appeal of modification of his order of disposition by the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, Pennsylvania. The modification added evaluation for chemical castration in addition to his continued confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, pleaded guilty but mentally ill to one count each of simple assault and terroristic threats. He was thereafter adjudicated delinquent and placed in a treatment facility. In the course of treatment, appellant admitted to a counselor that he had cravings to sexually assault little girls. The facility submitted a report to the court for its next periodic review hearing, which recommended that appellant undergo evaluation at a nationally recognized medical center to determine his receptivity to chemical castration. The court entered an order requiring him to remain in placement and to undergo such evaluation. Appellant filed an appeal. The court found the ordered evaluation did not conform to appellant's adjudication for assault and terroristic threats, and derived from his privileged relationship with the psychologist who uncovered the prior sexual deviance. The trial court abused its discretion in modifying its prior order of disposition, because there was not general agreement amongst experts as to the efficacy of chemical castration and the court did not receive expert testimony as to proven results for adolescents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order for evaluation and remanded for consideration by the trial court of an appropriate treatment, noting that chemical castration for a juvenile was too radical in nature and essential to basic human behavior to be imposed by a court as a condition of probation, without statutory guidelines.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 106, claiming appellee lacked standing to file the complaint under Rule 106 or 16 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1409.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two parole agents shot and killed an individual while attempting to arrest him. The district attorney presented the matter to an investigating grand jury, which concluded criminal charges were unwarranted. Subsequently, appellee, a private attorney, filed a private criminal complaint against the agents. Appellee did not assert that he was appearing on behalf of the victim, related to the victim's family or acting as its representative. The district attorney refused his private criminal complaint. Appellee sued in the common pleas court, which entered judgment in appellee's favor. It directed the district attorney to approve appellee's complaint and filed charges. The Commonwealth sought review. The court reversed, finding appellee lacked standing to request a private criminal complaint. Allowing citizens, who were unconnected to an alleged crime, to file a complaint violated established legal principles wherein standing was afforded only to those who had a direct, substantial, and immediate interest in the matter to be litigated. It would have had a profoundly negative and disruptive effect on the criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>

The question of timeliness of an appeal was jurisdictional. In order to preserve the right to appeal a final order of the trial court, appellant was required to file a notice of appeal within 30 days after the date of entry of that order. Appellant's motion for reconsideration did not expressly grant reconsideration within the 30 day appeal period required by Pa. R. App. P. 903(a). Indeed, the trial court did not act on the motion for reconsideration until more than 30 days after entry of the final appealable order.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother's daughter, born in March, suffered a subdural hemotoma, ostensibly committed by appellant's boyfriend in June. Six months later, while in appellant's sole care, her daughter sustained severe injuries to such an extent that she was hospitalized with multiple bone fractures. Upon hospital discharge, the daughter was put in foster care. The Office of Children and Youth (OCY) petitioned for dependency, which was granted. Aggravated circumstances were found and continued foster care placement was ordered. The same order was granted as to appellant's son after OCY, during the daughter's proceedings, discovered appellant was pregnant with him. Reunification plan with father, not with appellant, was ordered. The court affirmed as to both. Appellant admitted she was the sole caretaker at the time of her daughter's injuries and her caught-in-the-crib explanation did not match medical evidence, thus justifying the &quot;aggravated circumstances&quot; finding under 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania remanded with instructions to address defendants', priest, bishop, church and diocese, request to reverse the trial court's refusal to enter a judgment n.o.v. or to award a new trial in negligence action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minor sued to recover damages, alleging that defendant priest's conduct was part of a pattern of sexual molestation. The action also named as defendants a church, bishop, and diocese. The jury awarded $ 50,000 in punitive damages against defendant priest and $ 1,000,000 in punitive damages against other church defendants. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the decision of the appellate court that any liability by defendant church was barred by the statute of limitations, then remanded the cause for consideration of defendants' remaining issues. Inter alia, the appellate court held that the trial court erred in refusing to grant defendants' motion for judgment n.o.v. on the punitive damages. Although declining to recognize the tort of ministerial malpractice, the appellate court further held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to allow the defense of comparative negligence, refusing to instruct the jury regarding the doctrine of consensual agreement, and using special interrogatories that provided for the jury to find the church parties liable for either compensatory or punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court's refusal to enter a judgment n.o.v. as to the award of punitive damages was reversed because the only valid cause of action, ordinary negligence, did not support the imposition of punitive damages. Judgment otherwise was affirmed in all other respects, including admission of pedophilic behavior of other diocesan priests and refusal to allow defense of comparative negligence.</SPAN></P>

Informal supervision was instituted, but appellee soon ran away from home. Following appellee's later admission to the charges, and acceptance of his admission by appellant prosecution and the trial court, a hearing was conducted for disposition purposes. Appellant refused to agree to a consent decree, because a firearm was used in the offense and two victims were involved. Over objection, the trial court ordered an informal adjustment. On review, appellant sought a determination as to whether the trial court erred utilizing an informal adjustment. The court vacated the informal adjustment and remanded, because the fact that appellee ran away after informal adjustment procedures had been instituted, without petition, mandated the filing of a petition. In addition, after the petition was filed, appellant objected to a proposed consent decree, thus triggering the requirement that the matter be heard on its merits followed by findings, adjudication, and disposition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order that placed appellee under an informal disposition and remanded, because a petition was required once appellee ran away, and once the petition was filed and appellant objected to the consent decree the statute required the matter be heard on its merits followed by findings, adjudication, and disposition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Criminal Division (Pennsylvania), that entered judgment of sentence, pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9714, as a high risk dangerous offender, following his conviction for aggravated assault, possession of an instrument of crime, carrying a firearm without a license, and criminal conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After waiving his right to a jury trial, the trial court convicted appellant individual of aggravated assault, possession of an instrument of crime, carrying a firearm without a license, and criminal conspiracy. Appellee prosecution then notified appellant he was subject to sentencing pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9714(a)(1) as a high-risk dangerous offender, because aggravated assault was a crime of violence, and he had been previously convicted of a crime of violence. After a hearing, the trial court determined that appellant had failed to rebut the presumption that he was a high-risk dangerous offender. The trial court then imposed sentence. After an unsuccessful attempt, appellant sought review, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 9714, and arguing his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue. The court affirmed the sentence, and in turn, found the ineffectiveness issue moot, because &sect; 9714 did not create a presumption without requiring appellee to prove the facts that triggered the presumption, nor did it place the burden on appellant to prove he was not a dangerous offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that imposed appellant's sentence, because the statute requiring heightened punishment for high-risk dangerous offenders did not create a presumption without requiring appellee to prove facts triggering the presumption, nor did it impermissibly place the burden of persuasion on appellant. Based on that finding, the court dismissed appellant's ineffectiveness of counsel claim as moot.</SPAN></P>

The trial court confirmed the arbitration award, and the court affirmed. The Act effected a taking, but appellant received due process beforehand.

The court held that the trial court erred in suppressing, primarily on grounds that a mailed package should have been inviolate. While defendants had an automatic right to adjudicate the merits of a suppression motion, they could not have prevailed unless they separately demonstrated an invasion of their privacy. While the addressee might have had an expectation of privacy in the package addressed to her, defendants tried to argue that they had no connection to the package, so they could not have established an invasion of privacy, or prevailed on their motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action to collect a debt, appellant debtor appealed, interlocutorily, a decision holding that appellant was subject to personal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania. The court reversed. Appellant did not have the minimum contacts necessary to subject it to personal jurisdiction. Appellant had signed a contract with appellee, a Pennsylvania corporation, agreeing to send payments to that corporation at its Pennsylvania address. Appellant also had made several follow-up telephone calls to appellee regarding the contract. However, appellant had sought to transact business with an Alabama company. That company, not appellant, initiated the contact with appellee. Appellant was not incorporated in Pennsylvania, was not authorized, licensed, or registered to conduct business in Pennsylvania, or did it have any employees in Pennsylvania. All of the negotiations involving appellant occurred in Alabama, and that is where appellant signed the contract. Such contacts were not sufficient to cause appellant to anticipate being hailed into court in Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>

Because appellant had not purposefully directed its activities or conducted itself in a manner indicating that it had availed itself to the forum's privileges and benefits, the trial court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over appellant was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff State appealed a decision by the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County (Pennsylvania), granting defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized during a search of defendant's vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession, possession with intent to deliver, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Defendant moved to suppress evidence seized during a search of defendant's car, and the trial court granted the motion. Plaintiff State appealed the decision. The court held the trial court improperly relied on a supreme court decision for the proposition that one could never validly consent to having his car searched, subsequent to being stopped for speeding, without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The court held the supreme court had not prohibited every search not grounded in either reasonable suspicion or probable cause. The court held defendant's consent to search the car was validly obtained. The police officer returned defendant's identification and paperwork, and informed defendant that he was free to leave. Defendant then consented to the search. The court held the search was constitutionally valid, as it flowed from a mere encounter. The court reversed the motion to suppress and remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled the motion to suppress, because the trial court improperly interpreted a supreme court decision as prohibiting every search not grounded in reasonable suspicion or probable cause, and defendant consented to the search of the car after being told he was free to leave.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mother and father, had their two minor children removed from their care follow a declaration that the children were dependent. The trial court conducted three permanency review hearings, and at the third one, it was found appellants had made minimal progress toward alleviating the circumstances which necessitated placement and that the minor children were doing exceedingly well in their foster placement. Appellants filed an appeal. Affirming the trial court's determination, the court held nothing prevented the trial court from taking appellants' refusal to comply the mental health program into account when determining whether to change the goal for the minor children. Rather it was appellants' failure to attend GED classes or participate in drug and alcohol treatment, as well as the criminal charges facing both of them, that was the basis for the trial court's change of goal. Further, appellant mother was not entitled to suppression of evidence regarding her sexual relations with a 13 year old girl because dependency proceedings did not provide for suppression hearings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, criminal conspiracy, and firearms not to be carried without a license. Appellant was legally responsible as an accomplice for the underlying crime of possession with intent to deliver. The search of appellant's car parked legally on the street was not within the caretaking function of the police, thus it was not properly conducted without a warrant. Appellant's vehicle was not shown to cause a public safety or traffic control concern. The court held the commonwealth failed to demonstrate the police had the statutory authority under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3352(c)(3) to impound appellant's vehicle. Because the record failed to demonstrate a community care-taking function was served by impoundment, the police did not obtain lawful custody of the vehicle when the police impounded it and the trial court erred when it denied the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After wrecking his truck, police questioned appellant, noting his eyes were bloodshot, he smelled of alcohol, and his speech was slurred.

Evidence of appellant's BAC was admissible under 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1547(c) and (d)(3) to prove appellant violated 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(a)(1) and (a)(4).
