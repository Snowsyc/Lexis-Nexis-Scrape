</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two indictments presented against him for the sale and delivery of a controlled substance. He was sentenced to 18 years, with 12 years to serve, six years suspended, and five years of post-release supervision. The trial court denied his motion for postconviction relief. On appeal, the court found that there were two distinct factual bases for defendant's guilty plea. First, he admitted that he committed both crimes for which he was entering a plea of guilty. Second, the trial judge asked the assistant district attorney during the plea colloquy what the State expected the evidence to show at trial. Further, defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating his attorney's deficiency. Defendant admitted in his brief that he could not name the witness that counsel should have interviewed, nor did he disclose the &quot;mitigating information&quot; that counsel allegedly failed to uncover. Finally, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-7-2(1) (Rev. 2000) made single, multi-count indictments permissive, not mandatory. The State did not improperly indict defendant under multiple indictments.</SPAN></P>

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 6/22/2004. TRIAL JUDGE: HON. MICHAEL R. EUBANKS. TRIAL COURT DISPOSITION: CONVICTION OF AGGRAVATED DUI WITH INJURY IN VIOLATION OF MISSISSIPPI CODE ANNOTATED SECTION 63-11-30(5) AND SENTENCE OF TWENTY YEARS IN THE CUSTODY OF MDOC, WITH FIVE YEARS TO BE SERVED IN THE INTENSIVE SUPERVISION PROGRAM AND FIFTEEN YEARS SUSPENDED PENDING SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF A FIVE YEAR PERIOD OF POST-RELEASE SUPERVISION PURSUANT TO MISSISSIPPI CODE ANNOTATED SECTION 47-7-34.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Pearl River County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30(5) and sentenced him to 20 years in custody of the department of corrections. The State appealed defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ran a stop sign and struck a vehicle driven by the victim who suffered catastrophic injuries. Defendant contended that the four-hour delay in obtaining his blood sample rendered the test results inadmissible under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-8. The court noted that this case did not involve a vehicle accident under &sect; 63-11-8; rather, defendant was convicted under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30(5) for aggravated DUI. Although the blood test was administered more than two hours after the accident, the record was devoid of any proof that the arresting officer deliberately delayed the acquiring of a blood sample; defendant was not allowed to eat or drink anything throughout the time period; and thus the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The trial judge properly exercised his gatekeeping responsibility as to the admission of the State's testimony in the manner in which the Mississippi Supreme Court intended. Since the officers' request for and taking of a blood sample could not be considered custodial interrogation under the law, the court could not conclude that a violation of defendant's right to counsel occurred as a result of such tests being administered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of being an accessory after the fact to her husband's crime of statutory rape by assisting her minor daughter, the victim, obtain an abortion. That assistance helped hide the husband's crime by removing its most obvious evidence. The appellate court stated that it did not need to decide the constitutionality of charging concealment of a rape due to the assistance that defendant gave her minor daughter to gain an abortion. Defendant raised the issue before trial only later to abandon it. Thus, the issue was waived and the appellate court found no other errors. The evidence supported that defendant concealed, received, relieved, aided, or assisted her husband when she took the victim for an abortion. Those acts themselves were sufficient under the statutory language contained in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-1-5 (Rev. 2006).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police obtained a search warrant for defendant's residence after a church was broken into two different times. Stolen items were found in defendant's home. After defendant was convicted, he sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence found during the execution of the search warrant. Proximate cause existed based on the statements of several witnesses. Next, a motion to sever was properly denied as to the charges relating to the church burglaries because they were part of a common scheme or plan, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-7-2 (Rev. 2000). Further, an instruction on receiving stolen property was properly denied because no reasonable jury could have found defendant guilty of this offense based on defendant's admission, the codefendant's testimony, and the items found in defendant's home. Moreover, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 97-17-33(2), 97-17-43(2) were not unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause since they did not represent a government endorsement of religion. Finally, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not proper on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

The table of authorities was not related to any particular argument either. The appellate court also noted that the record was insufficient because it did not include a transcript of his guilty plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, who worked as a teacher and an assistant football coach, was notified that his contract would not be renewed for the following year due to the fact that he failed to attend several football workouts during the summer months. The chancery court affirmed the decision, and the employee sought further review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that a rider to the contract did not violate Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 37-9-23 (2006) based on the fact that it was not officially approved by the Mississippi Board of Education. Next, the rider did not violate the Fair Labor Standards Act because 29 C.F.R. &sect;&nbsp;541.303(b) exempted teachers, specifically those with coaching duties. At any rate, the additional two months listed in the rider were merely part of the usual coaching duties. Also, the appellate court rejected the argument that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 37-9-111(5) (Rev. 2001) was unconstitutional as applied under the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision was not arbitrary or capricious because the employment contract and rider referred to the single position of teacher/coach.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant participated in the beating death of a victim when he was barely sixteen. He was tried as an adult and convicted of murder. Thereafter, he sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that defendant's trial counsel failed to raise an issue relating to whether he should have been tried in youth court instead; therefore, the issue was waived on appeal. Even if it had not been waived, the circuit court had original jurisdiction over the murder charge under Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;43-21-151(1)(a) (Rev. 2004). Next, defendant did not show a violation of Batson since the prosecution offered race-neutral reasons for striking several jurors. Further, the appellate court found that his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment and the Mississippi Constitution was also not violated by a sixteen month delay between arrest and the date of trial after the Barker factors were considered. Finally, the confession given was voluntary since a showing of mental weakness was not enough, defendant waived an objection to the swearing of the jury, and evidence of the victim's pain was properly admitted, as were gruesome crime scene photographs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother appealed the termination of her parental rights to her minor child, but the court affirmed. The mother's testimony alone was sufficient evidence to support the youth court's finding that her behavior, choosing to remain on runaway status to avoid the Department of Human Services (DHS), was the reason that her child could not be returned to her within a reasonable amount of time. Additionally, the court found that the findings of the youth court met the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights contained in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-15-103(3)(d)-(f) (Rev. 2004). The child was in the custody of the DHS since July 31, 2001, which was well over the statutory requirement of one year, and the mother's ongoing behavior was a ground for termination of her parental rights. The ongoing behavior cited by the youth court was the mother's decision to remain on runaway status, thus preventing her from maintaining a bond with the child, as it was impossible to return the child to her custody and care when she chose to avoid the DHS.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee was terminated from her position as a secretary after the employer suspected that the employee was misappropriating employee property. The employee filed for unemployment benefits, and the claims examiner recommended payment of benefits.

The employer did not file an appeal until 18 days after the deadline. The employer claimed that the appeal was based upon alleged new evidence concerning the employee's embezzlement activity. The Commission's Board of Review agreed with the hearing officer that the employer's notice of appeal was not timely and the circuit court affirmed. The circuit court found that the employer had failed to show good cause for filing an untimely appeal. Affirming, the court noted that it was undisputed that the employer had notice that the appeal needed to be filed within 14 days and that the employer did not comply. Because the employer did not file the appeal within the period specified in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 71-5-517 (2000), the Board properly refused to consider the new evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant failed to make an initial showing that his sentences were grossly disproportionate to the crimes he committed. Additionally, the appellate court disagreed that sentences of 30 years and 20 years were disproportionate to defendant's crimes because (1) he fired a 12 gauge shotgun at the victim while both men were driving, jeopardizing himself, the victim, and any other persons on the road that night; (2) defendant then ambushed the victim at home, where he attempted to shoot the victim again; and (3) the victim suffered a grievous injury to his face.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's attorney was allowed to cross-examine the confidential informant thoroughly. Defendant's first trial resulted in a mistrial as a result of a hung jury. Before the second trial began, the confidential informant died; therefore, he was unavailable to testify. The confidential informant's testimony from the first trial's transcript was read into evidence during the second trial. On appeal, defendant argued that the confidential informant's testimony from the previous trial should not have been allowed into evidence because defendant was not able to cross-examine the confidential informant and the jury was unable to observe the confidential informant's demeanor. When the transcript of prior testimony of an unavailable witness reflected extensive cross-examination, the former testimony was admissible under Miss. R. Evid. 804(b)(1).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A third party bought two cats from the individual, and the cats were later found to be afflicted with fleas, ringworm, respiratory infection, and Giardia, a harmful parasite. The veterinarian told the third party to contact the health department to prevent the spread of the disease. After a complaint was filed, an animal control officer inspected the home with the individual's permission and found the home to be unsuitable for cats or humans. The cats were malnourished and had other health issues. A search warrant was issued based on the officer's inspection. The individual's cats were seized, and the present action was filed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the state law claims as there was probable cause to search her home based on the consensual animal control inspection, and the individual's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated as they did not attach because the individual was not charged with a crime. The 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&nbsp;1983 claims were properly dismissed because the individual failed to prove that she was deprived of a right secured by the Constitution and that the city inflicted injury upon her in the execution of governmental policy or custom.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow a false juvenile confession expert to testify under Miss. R. Evid. 702 because the expert admitted that her theory could not be ethically tested, the proponents of the field of expert testimony regarding false confessions seemed to be a small group, the expert testified that there was no way to discern a possible rate of error in the filing of false confessions, and the trial court could not say that expert opinion in the field of false confessions was widely accepted within the scientific community.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Sunflower County (Mississippi) that denied his petition for a writ of mandamus naming appellees, the parole board and the board's chair, and alleging that the parole board had repeatedly denied his rights to due process and equal protection in failing to order a psychiatric evaluation prior to each of the inmate's parole hearings as required by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-3 (1972).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's parole had been revoked and he was returned to prison to serve the rest of his life sentence on a rape conviction. The inmate sought a writ of mandamus after parole was denied several times, arguing that he was denied due process and equal protection due to the parole board's failure to give him a psychiatric evaluation prior to his parole hearings. The court held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-3 (1972) did not require an evaluation prior to a parole hearing; rather &sect; 47-7-3 clearly stated that an inmate must be eligible for parole before he was entitled to a psychiatric evaluation. The court found that the inmate did not have a liberty interest in parole because Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 47-7-3 and 47-7-17 used the permissive &quot;may&quot; and not the mandatory &quot;shall.&quot; The court rejected the inmate's claim that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-27 was unconstitutionally vague because it applied to offenders who had previously had parole revoked, and clearly provided that the inmate's eligibility for a second parole was subject to the board's discretion, and that the inmate was only entitled to a psychological evaluation if the parole board exercised its discretion to grant him a second parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Greene County (Mississippi), which upheld a decision from the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-5-138.1 (Rev. 2004) was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law as applied to offenders who committed the crime of sale or manufacture of a controlled substance prior to the effective date of the amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the sale of cocaine and was sentenced to prison. He entered trusty status under &sect; 47-5-138.1. Section 47-5-138.1 was amended in 2004 to allow a trusty time allowance of 30 days' reduction of sentence for 30 days' participation. However, under the amendment, an offender was not eligible for trusty status if the offender was convicted of trafficking in controlled substances. Defendant filed a petition with the MDOC Administrative Remedy Program, arguing that &sect; 47-5-138.1, as amended, was an unconstitutional ex post facto law. The MDOC responded that while defendant would not be eligible for the 30 days' reduction for 30 days' participation, he would maintain the previous trusty time status of 10 days for 30 days. The trial court upheld the MDOC's decision. On appeal, the court found that the amendment to the statute did not, in any way, disadvantage defendant. He remained in the same position regardless of the amendment. Because he entered trusty status in 2002, he continued to receive the 10 days for 30 days time benefit under the prior statute. The statute did not violate the ex post facto clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Lauderdale County Circuit Court (Mississippi) convicted defendant of the crimes of kidnapping and robbery by use of a deadly weapon. For the kidnapping charge, he was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment plus payment of restitution. For the armed robbery charge, he was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. The sentences were to run concurrently. His motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial was denied, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two masked gunmen broke into the victims' home, bound them with duct tape, and proceeded to take their money, rings, and property, while repeatedly threatening to kill them during the 45 minute ordeal. Defendant, represented by appointed counsel, entered into a plea bargain with the State, in which he agreed to a plea of guilty to armed robbery and to testify truthfully against his co-defendant. During his co-defendant's trial, defendant refused to testify, despite his earlier plea agreement with the State. As a result of his refusal to testify, the State moved to revoke defendant's plea bargain, vacated the armed robbery sentence, and reinstated the kidnapping charge. Defendant's voluntary refusal to testify against his co-defendant constituted a material breach of the plea bargain. As a result of that breach, the parties were returned to the status quo ante, and defendant had no double jeopardy defense available concerning re-indictment and conviction on the charges. Also, the transcript of his guilty plea hearing clearly showed that he was aware that the State would seek to invalidate his plea and reinstate the charges if he failed to testify truthfully against his co-defendant.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because the defendant's arrest and the search warrant were based on probable cause to believe defendant had or was committing a crime, where defendant admitted he had drug paraphernalia in the house, and the informant's reliability was corroborated by the recording of the conversations. The court also held that defendant's enhanced sentence under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-152 was not disproportionate and did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment because his sentence did not exceed the statutory limits. Also, the trial court was not required under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-149 to reduce the statutory sentence for first time offenders. The court rejected defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted as an habitual offender pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-83 (2000) on the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-37-5 (2000). After his motion to suppress any and all tangible evidence, statements, and information acquired by the State was denied, he was convicted, and a life sentence was imposed. He appealed on numerous grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested pursuant to a felony warrant. Later at the police station, during an inventory search of his suitcase, a firearm was recovered. Defendant asserted that the search of his suitcase was in violation of the Fourth Amendment and that he was entitled to a second Miranda warning once the officers confronted him with the gun they discovered in his suitcase. However, the appellate court held the gun was the result of a valid search; therefore, his confession (admitting that he was holding the gun for a friend), which stemmed from the fruit of the search, was also admissible. Secondly, during trial, while the testimony regarding defendant's prior arrest for kidnaping was improper (apparently, a charge for which he was not convicted), the trial judge sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony. Thus, defendant did not suffer prejudice. Third, where defendant had two prior felonies, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-37-5 (2000) did not limit the State to proving that defendant had only been convicted of one prior felony. Finally, counsel was not ineffective for failing to &quot;timely&quot; file a motion to suppress. Again, the evidence at issue was admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of two charges of kidnaping, two charges of sexual battery, and one charge of rape. The Hinds County Circuit Court, Second Judicial District (Mississippi) sentenced him to a 160 year term in the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Defendant filed unsuccessful motions for a directed verdict, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and for a new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant claimed that the sexual battery and rape charges were duplicitous, giving rise to a double jeopardy violation. He argued that the elements of rape were the same as sexual battery as both required a sex act against a victim's will. The appellate court held that there was no merit to defendant's claim. The jury found him guilty of one charge of rape and two charges of sexual battery. The rape charge was incident to forced intercourse and the two sexual battery charges followed forced oral sex and sodomy. Rape and sexual battery were not duplicitous. Rape was forcible sexual intercourse. Sodomy could never qualify with the statutory definition of rape. Likewise, oral sex could never fall within the statutory meaning of rape. Sexual battery, involved unconsented &quot;sexual penetration.&quot; &quot;Sexual penetration&quot; could include intercourse, sodomy, or fellatio. The three charges clearly alleged three distinctly separate acts, they were not duplicitous and they did not expose defendant to double jeopardy. In another issue, since defendant's sentence for any one count was not greater than the maximum sentence for that count, the sentence could not be disturbed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction. The victim testified that she became very drunk and blacked out; when she awoke, she was naked in defendant's bedroom. The subsequent birth and DNA match corroborated the sexual assault. The victim's testimony regarding the effect that the alcohol had on her was sufficient to show that it was defendant's administration of alcohol that caused her to be unable to resist or consent to his sexual advances. Defendant's behavior violated Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-65(4), and he knew or should have known that his conduct was prohibited. The statute intended to prohibit and penalize someone who administered to another a substance or liquid that caused the other to be incapable of consenting or resisting sexual intercourse, and thereafter proceeded to have sexual intercourse with the incapacitated individual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in the Harrison County Circuit Court, Mississippi, for the offense of kidnapping and sexual battery. He received 2 concurrent sentences of 20 years in prison. Some six years after his conviction, he requested and received leave from the Mississippi Supreme Court to file a &quot;motion to correct sentence&quot;; however, the trial court denied the motion. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that his &quot;motion to correct sentence&quot; should have been granted because he was illegally sentenced under a statute that was not in effect at the time of his crime, and as a result he had been improperly denied parole. The trial court and the State contended that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-5-138 did not apply to appellant. The appellate court noted that in Puckett v. Abels, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-5-138 was an unconstitutional ex post facto law when applied to persons who were charged with committing crimes prior to July 1, 1995, but who were not to be sentenced until on or after July 1, 1995. Appellant committed his crimes on September 2, 1994, he was indicted on February 24, 1995, and he was sentenced on September 7, 1995. The appellate court concluded that applying Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-5-138 to appellant was clearly impermissible. Under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-3, because he was an offender over the age of 19, he was clearly ineligible for parole.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-47 (Rev. 2000), and currently appealed the denial of his motion for post-conviction relief. The court affirmed however, stating that the two convictions did not subject him to double jeopardy because aggravated DUI required an element not required by culpable negligence manslaughter, which was intoxication. The inmate argued that the trial judge violated Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-7-2 (Rev. 2000) by entering a single order sentencing him for both of the offenses for which he was convicted, but the court disagreed, stating that the circuit court imposed separate sentences for each count of the indictment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Prentiss County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of the possession of 73.7 grams of marijuana with the intent to distribute in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139(a)(1) (Rev. 2001). He was also sentenced as a habitual offender under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81 (Rev. 2000).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's appeal followed his conviction of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Due to his proximity to a public park, his conviction carried an enhanced sentence pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-142(1) (Rev. 2001). Additionally, the trial court sentenced him as a habitual offender under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81 (Rev. 2000). On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that the State did not fail to prove that the park was a public park. There was a wealth of testimony that indicated that the park was a city park and was maintained by the city. Viewed in a light most favorable to the State, a reasonable juror would have been justified in concluding that a city park would have been available for public use. Although the trial court abused its discretion when it permitted the State to introduce evidence forbidden by Miss. R. Evid. 803(5), the court was unable to say that the trial court's decision prejudiced defendant's case. The trial court did not err in overruling his motion to suppress his statement because defendant himself initiated the contact with the officer and also signed a document by which he waived his Miranda rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Forrest County Circuit Court (Mississippi) convicted defendant of possession of more than 30 grams of cocaine with the intent to transfer or distribute, within 1,500 feet of a church. Defendant was sentenced to 60 years in prison with 10 years suspended on post-release supervision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant maintained that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress. The officers proceeded to search defendant's property only after being authorized to do so, pursuant to the consent to search form executed by defendant in writing. There was no error in admitting a police officer's testimony to show why he was at defendant's residence. There was no error in introducing evidence of the cocaine seized as defendant offered no proof of either a break in the chain of custody or any tampering with the evidence. A police officer's fingerprint opinion testimony was admissible under Miss. R. Evid. 701. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury that it could consider the street value of the cocaine when determining whether the substance was possessed with intent to distribute. The indictment gave proper notice to defendant, even though it contained an error of imprecise language. Defendant's sentence was within the statutory limits and not disproportionate to the crime he committed, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-142(1). As there was no reversible error in any part, there was no reversible error to the whole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Monroe County Circuit Court, Mississippi, dismissed defendant's petition for post-conviction relief as moot as defendant had been released from prison upon an administrative error. He was then re-incarcerated to serve the remaining portion of his ten year sentence. His motion to reinstate his petition for post-conviction relief was granted, and then denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by restructuring the sentence imposed from concurrent to consecutive, thereby increasing the total term of imprisonment imposed and subjecting him to double jeopardy. After failing several times to conduct himself with the terms of his probation, defendant's sentence was restructured to change the original concurrent fifteen year sentence received to a consecutive ten year sentence. The appellate court found that the trial court acted improperly by amending the initial sentence. The Mississippi Supreme Court adopted the legal theory that once a circuit or county court exercised its option to impose a definite sentence it could not subsequently set that sentence aside and impose a greater sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant met the victim in a bar. They drove to a bridge, argued over the price of sex, and he punched her and then threw her over the bridge railing into a river, where she drowned. Defendant argued that his counsel was ineffective for failing to request a mental evaluation of his competence to stand trial. However, the defense made a motion to have defendant examined for competency, and the mental evaluation was in fact performed. Counsel's motion to try separately the issues of insanity and the merits of the case was a defense strategy and not grounds for an ineffectiveness claim. The court assumed that the mental evaluation, which was not in the record, dispelled the lower court's question that defendant could be incompetent to stand trial; hence, the trial court was not required to hold a hearing under Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; County Ct. Prac. R. 9.06. The trial court's order of a mental evaluation was not a finding of reasonable ground entitling defendant to a competency hearing, because under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-13-11, no reasonable ground was required for an evaluation. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-5-139(1)(a).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found no error, noting that when the State realized that the witness was going to testify, he was removed from the courtroom. As for the contention that it was reversible error for the trial court not to have administered the capital juror oath, the appellate court disagreed, noting that the oath administered was substantially equivalent. The appellate court also concluded that testimony that defendant was seen holding the gun used and that gunshot residue was only found on defendant was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. The appellate court further concluded that the admission into evidence of photographs of the scene was proper because they were probative of various issues before the jury. Finally, the appellate court concluded that the trial court did not err in preventing the victim's mother from testifying about a statement made by defendant an hour after the incident because it was too remote to be an excited utterance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Jackson County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of capital murder in violation of Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his capital murder conviction, but the court affirmed on appeal, stating that depraved heart murder subsumed &quot;deliberate design/premeditated murder.&quot; Therefore, the depraved heart murder instruction did not constructively amend the indictment. Further, the indictment cited to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(2)(a) (Rev. 2000), which made the case a capital offense and informed defendant of what made his offense a capital crime. Because defendant did not request a sentencing hearing prior to the imposition of his sentence, that issue was procedurally barred. Even absent a procedural bar, however, the issue lacked merit. Section &sect; 97-3-19(2) did not violate U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV because the fact that Mississippi's capital murder scheme made the death penalty a possible punishment for felony murder where there was no requirement to prove an intent to kill, and not premeditated murder, did not make the Mississippi capital murder statute unconstitutional. The evidence was substantial to support the verdict based on the testimony of an officer and the fact that the credibility of the witnesses' testimony and its weight was for the jury to resolve.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, five former officers, brought an action against appellee, the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, asserting that they possessed a right in equity to unused leave time. The Chancery Court in the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, granted the Department's motion to dismiss on the grounds of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and/or for the failure to exhaust all administrative remedies. The officers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the officers were entitled to equitable review of their claims relating to compensation and retirement benefits, which were excluded from state service grievance procedures. A first officer had tried the issue on appeal before the Mississippi Supreme Court previously. Upon the release of the aforementioned decision, the remaining officers' cases were dismissed by the circuit courts. All officers then sought equitable relief in a single action. Central to the officers' appeal was Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 25-13-11(e) (Rev. 2003), which at the time their cause of action accrued provided, in part, that the aggregate amount of the employer's annuity and prior service annuity would not exceed more than 85 percent of the average compensation regardless of the years of service. In the first officer's individual action, the Mississippi Supreme Court had already found &sect; 25-13-11(e) constitutional. As said former decision addressed the claims at issue in the instant proceeding, said issues could not again be litigated in the form of an equitable issue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi) convicted defendant of the capital murder of the deceased victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his Batson challenge, defendant did not establish a prima facie case that the State excluded jurors on the basis of race, thus there was no need for the State to present race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. Additionally, there was ample evidence to support the guilty verdict for capital murder because (1) an accomplice testified that he and defendant attempted to rob the victims and thus proved the underlying felony of robbery, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-79; (2) three detectives testified that defendant confessed to shooting the deceased victim; and (3) defendant's letters to the accomplice apparently expressed his concern in the accomplice's testimony against him. Because the evidence was not such that reasonable jurors could only find defendant not guilty, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss and for a judgment of acquittal. In addition, the appellate court could not say that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial because he did not suffer serious and irreparable damage from the investigator's statement inferring that defendant was incarcerated when he interviewed him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a prior convicted felon, pled guilty to conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, with 12 years suspended and five years of post-release supervision. The trial court dismissed his motion for postconviction relief. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in suspending a portion of defendant's sentence. It was not disputed that defendant was a prior convicted felon. Because he was a prior convicted felon, the trial court did not have the authority under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-33 (Rev. 2004) to suspend the imposition or execution of his sentence. As to defendant's remaining contentions, the court found that it was clear from the transcript of the guilty plea hearing that he understood that the maximum sentence for his crime was 20 years, that his plea was an open plea, and that the trial court could sentence him to the maximum, regardless of the State's recommendation. Hence, his guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered. The court further found that defendant was not entitled to relief on his Fourth Amendment claim, because he waived his right to challenge the State's evidence by entering a valid guilty plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded the case to the trial court for the entrance of a proper sentencing order. The court affirmed the order of the trial court in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Harrison County Circuit Court (Mississippi) that denied his petition for post-conviction relief. Defendant had pled guilty to sexual battery and received a suspended 10-year sentence and was placed on post-release supervision for three years and probation, which was later revoked for violating the terms of his post-release supervision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of post-conviction relief. Defendant had pled guilty to sexual battery based upon a charge that he ordered his victim at knife point to perform oral sex. On appeal, defendant argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel; his guilty plea was involuntary; he was not competent to enter a plea of guilty; and that he received an illegal sentence because he had two prior convictions and was not entitled to a suspended sentence as provided in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-33. The court held that defendant failed to establish that his attorney's performance was deficient because the record showed that he was advised of the charges and all possible defenses and sentences. The court agreed with the trial court's finding that defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence regarding his alleged mental disorder. The court found that defendant did not plead guilty as a result of an offer of a suspended sentence because he clearly understood that he could have received the maximum of 30 years; also he benefited from the illegal sentence since it was more lenient than he was actually entitled to receive, thus he did not suffer any fundamental unfairness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Lowndes County Circuit Court (Mississippi) that convicted him of robbery and sentenced him to life imprisonment as a habitual offender under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-83(3) (Rev. 2000). Defendant claimed errors regarding the indictment, the lack of a competency hearing, the peremptory challenges, the identifications, his speedy trial right, refused instructions, and the proportionality of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment as a habitual offender after snatching a woman's purse in a store parking lot. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that the timing of the amendment of the habitual offender portion of the indictment did not allow him sufficient time to prepare his defense. The court held that it was within the trial court's discretion to decide whether to hold a competency hearing. The court noted that the principal offense of robbery was not a capital crime, and thus defendant was not entitled to 12 peremptory challenges under Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; County Ct. Prac. R. 10.01 and Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-17-3 (2004). The court found that defendant failed to present any evidence of an improperly suggestive pretrial identification by the victim that tainted subsequent identifications at trial. There was no violation of defendant's constitutional or statutory right to a speedy trial because he was responsible for much of the 37-month delay. The court concluded that there was no inference that the habitual offender sentence was disproportionate where defendant had four felony convictions, with two for violent crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that convicted defendant of robbery and sentenced him to life imprisonment as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him to forty years and in denying his post-trial motions. Defendant argued that the informant, who provided information establishing probable cause for the search warrant, was not reliable. The appellate court noted that defendant did not raise the issue at trial. The issue was without merit where testimony established that the informant was searched before the initial buy and subsequent attempted buy. The transactions were recorded. The informant had worked as a confidential informant prior to the transaction. Defendant's sentence was neither excessive nor did it exceed the bounds of the penalty allowed under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-142(1) (Rev. 2000). Since he did not contend that the sentence was unconstitutional and allow the trial judge an opportunity to consider the issue, he could not assert this allegation on appeal. Because the sentence was within the guidelines of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139(b)(1), it was not disproportionate to the crime charged. The jury chose to believe the State's witnesses, which emphasized that the evidence placed before the jury by the State was more credible than defendant's testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a couple, were convicted of possession of precursor chemicals with the intent to manufacture methamphetamines in the Circuit Court of Greene County, Mississippi. Both were sentenced to a term of 25 years. They appealed, asserting, in part, that the search warrant was not valid for want of probable cause, that the State failed to establish a proper chain of custody, and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain their convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendants argued that an &quot;underlying facts and circumstances&quot; sheet was not attached to the affidavit for the search warrant and that no information was given to establish the reliability of the informant. However, the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; standard for determining the existence of probable cause applied. The officer who applied for the search warrant gave detailed information regarding the location of the residence where the drugs were being manufactured and testified that the informant, an eyewitness, stated that he bought and supplied defendants with precursor elements. Thus, there was sufficient probable cause to support the search warrant. Secondly, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the State failed to establish a proper chain of custody by not producing to testify, every officer that seized an item the State wanted to introduce into evidence. Finally, the fact the State sought and obtained the removal of one precursor chemical from the indictment caused no prejudice to defendants, where the State did prove they possessed two or more precursor chemicals, and defendants' sentences, within the statutory limits, was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the district lacked the authority to enact the ordinance that regulated individual wastewater systems and that the ordinance was preempted by the Mississippi Individual On-Site Wastewater Disposal System Law, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-67-1 to 41-67-31 (Rev. 2001). The district argued that the ordinance was not preempted by &sect; 41-67-31and that it was enacted pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 19-5-173 (Rev. 2003). The court found that the district acted under the authority of its general police powers and that the ordinance was a valid exercise of its authority under &sect; 19-5-173. The court noted that the Wastewater Law did not mention sewer districts and did not expressly prevent sewer districts from regulating individual on-site wastewater disposal systems. Also the court held that the Wastewater Law did not repeal Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 19-5-173, which gave the district the power to regulate the general health of its residents. The court noted that the ordinance was adopted at the request of the Department of Health, which was the agency given the authority under the Wastewater Law over wastewater disposal systems.</SPAN></P>

The assessed fines did not constitute a criminal penalty. Defendant was not subject to a multiplicitous indictment. By refusing to instruct on &quot;willfully attempts,&quot; the trial court did not fail to instruct on an essential element of the offense. Defendant claimed that the search warrant was for pornographic materials, and that the seizure of a notebook and defendant's income tax returns was an impermissible expansion of the warrant. This matter, however, had already been litigated. Counsel did not render ineffective assistance.

The appellate court disagreed, finding no evidence that the trial court considered anything outside the pleadings, especially when no discovery had been propounded. Even so, the trial court could have considered information outside the pleadings without converting the dismissal motion into one for summary judgment. The appellate court also found that the chief justice enjoyed the protection of judicial immunity as she had no authority to act as she did in appointing a special chancellor other than by virtue of her position as chief justice. Further, an appointment pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 9-1-105 was a judicial act; the individuals' attempt to label the appointment as administrative or non-adjudicative was without merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed from an order entered in the Circuit Court of Forrest County, Mississippi, denying his motion for post-conviction relief. Two issues were raised on appeal: 1) whether he waived his double jeopardy claim by pleading guilty to armed robbery and 2) whether double jeopardy occurred in violation of his constitutional rights when he was re-indicted for the same armed robbery which secured his conviction of capital murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of capital murder in 1977 and sentenced to death. The death sentence was subsequently overturned and a life sentence was imposed. In 1996, the inmate filed his first petition for post-conviction relief claiming that he had an ex post facto claim. The state supreme court affirmed that the inmate had waived those claims. In his second petition for post-conviction relief, the inmate claimed that the trial court committed reversible error by sentencing him for armed robbery since that same crime was the underlying felony used to elevate the killing of the victim to capital murder. The appellate court affirmed the denial of the inmate's motion for post-conviction relief as the inmate did not cite any intervening cases or newly discovered evidence that would except his claim from the procedural bar in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-27(9) (Rev. 2000). Further, the inmate's claim was time barred as it was not filed within three years after entry of the judgment of conviction as required by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) (Supp. 2002).</SPAN></P>

Specifically, appellant argued that the State did not carry its burden because no evidence was adduced that the victim suffered any bodily injury. The appellate court found that the petition did not give the trial judge the option of an attempt charge in this simple assault case. Additionally, the record was devoid of any questions or answers regarding injury to the victim. Although touching was mentioned, even by the victim, there was nothing about pain, hurt, or injury caused at the hands of appellant. Thus, the State failed to prove all of the elements of simple assault as charged in the petition and appellant was improperly adjudicated a delinquent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the fact that the victim had been treated for anger management in a prior unspecified year did not prove that, during the period of time leading up to the killing, he had engaged in such aggressive and violent behavior with defendant so as to warrant her having a reasonable apprehension that, in any altercation between them, he was likely to do her serious bodily harm. Defendant did not testify that the victim was still engaging in aggressive and uncontrollable behavior toward her or that his past behavior toward her left her apprehensive of him. Hence, the trial court did not commit reversible error when it failed to review the victim's medical records and take testimony from the victim's psychotherapist before ruling that the victim had not waived the medical privilege by taking defendant to one of his psychotherapy sessions. The court further found no merit to defendant's insufficiency of the evidence argument. The court's reading of the record convinced it that the jury was more than generous to defendant in not returning a verdict of murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his request to disallow the State's use of peremptory challenges during jury selection. He also contended that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to an inquiry made by the prosecutor, made during defendant's cross-examination, that was intended to call into question his credibility. The appellate court determined that there was no Mississippi precedent binding on the appellate court that suggested that Miss. Code &sect; 13-5-69, authorizing peremptory strikes, was unconstitutional. Defendant did not contend that any strikes actually exercised by the prosecution violated any of the provisions of Batson. The prosecutor's questioning of defendant was irrelevant and, on its face, argumentative and had no possibility of eliciting information that would have been helpful to the jury in determining any fact of consequence in deciding defendant's culpability. The error in permitting the State to propound the question and requiring defendant to answer was harmless error as defendant did not allege any particular basis for concluding that this inquiry resulted in any prejudice or harm to the defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The MMHA appealed from the circuit court's affirmance of the amendment of a zoning ordinance, asserting that ordinance was arbitrary and capricious and therefore violated its rights to due process as secured under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed however, finding that the MMHA failed to show that the ordinance was not substantially related to a legitimate government purpose. The record failed to show how any homeowner or MMHA member suffered injury from the amended zoning ordinance. Moreover, by MMHA's own admission, the previous zoning ordinance encompassed greater disparate requirements for lot size than the amended ordinance, and under the previous ordinance any attempt by a developer to build a subdivision of manufactured housing required a variance, and that appears unchanged by the amendment of the ordinance. MMHA was actually benefitted by the amendment to the ordinance which MMHA never challenged prior to the amendment. The presumption that a political entity exercised its zoning power to further a legitimate purpose was not overcome.</SPAN></P>

He explained that he wanted to rob and burn the sister's store and then her house, where his former wife was living. Defendant was subsequently convicted of attempting a burglary, arson, and a murder, and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The errors contained in the search warrants were clerical and did not rise to the level necessary to invalidate them. Further, there was probable cause for the issuance of the second warrant in order to search defendant's home concerning conviction records from Tennessee, because the wife informed the officers that she had seen those papers at her home during her marriage. Venue was proper pursuant to U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 2 cl. 3, U.S. Const. amend. VI, and Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 26, because there was nothing conceptually outrageous or bizarre in bringing charges in the count for attempting to burn a building in that county. Whether the target buildings in the county were seen as the effects or the means of the crime, there was the right under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-11-19 (Rev. 2000) to bring the charges in that county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying action arose when narcotics agents set up a buy-bust, enlisting the service of an informant to attempt to purchase marijuana from defendant. After defendant was processed, according to the agents, defendant agreed to cooperate with the agents' investigation of marijuana trafficking in the area. On review, defendant contended that he was entitled to be set free or at least granted a new trial because the State reneged on a deal and engaged in improper conduct, arguing that he had no other choice but to agree to work as a confidential informant. The appellate court found that defendant voluntarily agreed to become a confidential informant and never actually performed any act as a confidential informant. Moreover, defendant did not show the terms and conditions of his agreement with the State. The only evidence that did exist regarding the agreement was that defendant would act as a confidential informant, that he would not make any contact with the informant, and that the agents learned that defendant violated the prohibition against contacting the informant and terminated the agreement.</SPAN></P>

The fact that defendant was the primary target of investigation did not change the court's decision. Further, the State was not required to set forth a coherent theory and prove through evidence that defendant committed an act to cause the victim to asphyxiate. The jury instruction given properly set forth the State's theory of suffocation and death by asphyxiation, despite how defendant might have committed the crime. The court determined that the indictment was also not required to set forth the manner of death, and it sufficiently apprised defendant of the nature and cause of the accusations. Finally, defendant's motion for an acquittal and for a new trial were properly denied because the verdict was not against the overwhelming weight of evidence.</SPAN></P>

Appellant intervenors objected. The chancery court adopted a submitted plan. The intervenors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the most recent census, the State's delegation to the United States House of Representatives was reduced from five to four representatives. However, the state legislature left the old five-district plan in place. Concerned about the State's failure to act, the voters filed for injunctive relief in the chancery court. They alleged that the state legislature would not submit a new redistricting plan. They requested that the chancery court adopt and implement a plan in time for the required preclearance mandated by federal voting law and a state law candidate qualifying deadline. The intervenors objected. The chancery court assumed jurisdiction and adopted a submitted congressional redistricting plan. In the meantime, a federal trial court ordered that the State use a plan it had adopted until the State produced a congressional redistricting plan that was precleared. The intervenors appealed. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the chancery court, pursuant to state law, did not have jurisdiction to adopt a submitted congressional redistricting plan, as state law dictated that only the state legislature had the power to authorize new congressional districts.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that, as these claims had been considered and rejected on direct appeal, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21(3), res judicata barred further consideration of them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A minor child was born to a young, unmarried couple. Several days after the birth, the biological mother's parents adopted the child. For several years, the grandparents enjoyed visitation with the child. After the relationship between the couple deteriorated, the adoptive parents sought to stop all visitation. Thereafter, the grandparents filed a petition for visitation under the Mississippi Grandparents' Visitation Statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 93-16-1 to 93-16-7 (1994). After the grandparents' petition was granted, the adoptive parents sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the Visitation Statute was not unconstitutional. Further, the adoptive parents enjoyed no presumption with regards to their opinion that visitation would not have been in the best interest of the child. The chancery court properly examined 10 factors in determining that visitation was appropriate. The evidence showed that the grandparents had a relationship with the child, the child lived nearby, the grandparents were at home to watch the child, the child was of an appropriate age, and the grandparents were in good health. Finally, the court determined that attorney fees were not appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the chancery court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Warren County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which convicted him of aggravated assault, rape, two counts of armed robbery, and six counts of kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant kidnapped a woman and her children when they arrived to look at a home for sale. Defendant forced the woman to perform sexual acts and took some of her belongings. They also beat and robbed the owner of the home. During the assaults, the woman's children were locked inside of a closet. After defendant was convicted of numerous crimes, he sought review. On appeal, the court determined that evidence obtained during a traffic stop was admissible under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-3-7(1) (Rev. 2000) because the officer had a reasonable belief that a crime had been committed and that defendant committed the crime. The evidence showed that the officer recognized defendant from an ATM videotape. Further, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-53 was not unconstitutionally vague because defendant was informed of the crime of kidnapping. The fact that the woman knew where the children were during the assault did not invalidate defendant's convictions for kidnapping under &sect; 97-3-53. Also, there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction for aggravated assault, and defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the 35-year sentences for kidnapping were contrary to &sect; 97-3-53.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portion of the judgment that sentenced defendant to 35 years on each count of kidnapping. The case was remanded with instructions to sentence defendant to 30 years on each count. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Neshoba County Chancery Court, Mississippi, granted judgment in favor of appellee, estate administratrix to the deceased Jane Doe, finding that appellant, the natural father of Jane Doe, had failed to comply with the one-year limitation established by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15 (Rev. 1994) in that he had taken no action to be declared the father within one year of her death. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court erred in finding that the administratrix was not de son tort since she knew of the wrongful death claim of the child and willfully concealed it. The father argued that he had to be excused from the statutory period of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15(3) because of the administratrix's conduct and that he should be declared the rightful and exclusive wrongful death beneficiary. The appellate court noted that there was no evidence that the administratrix took any action relative to the assets or estate of the child during the period of May 31, 1999 through May 31, 2000. The administratrix did not have any idea that there were assets until the estate was opened on June 13, 2001. There was nothing to indicate that she took any action as an administratrix de son tort prior to May 31, 2000. The father failed to raise his constitutional challenge as required by Miss. R. App. P. 44, by not giving the required notice of the issue to the state attorney general; as such, the appellate court declined to address the issue of constitutionality of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15(3)(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow filed an amended complaint against defendants, a city, its police chief, the officer who shot the decedent, and a second officer, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and alleging state tort claims. The Marion County Circuit Court (Mississippi) granted summary judgment in favor of the city, the chief, and the second officer and denied such to the shooting officer. The widow and the shooting officer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent pointed a gun at the officers and backed into his house. Refusing the officers' demands that he put down the gun, he fired on the shooting officer. The shooting officer returned fire as he followed the decedent into the house. The decedent was mortally wounded in the exchange. In the instant suit the widow alleged constitutional tort and state law tort claims. In the widow's appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the city as the widow failed to show a facially invalid city policy; that the city demonstrated any deliberate indifference to any known or obvious consequences that might have resulted in any constitutional deprivation from execution or any city policy or any persistent, widespread practice or custom; or that causation existed between any city policy or custom and that such was the moving force for the shooting officer's actions. On the officer's interlocutory appeal the court reversed the judgment. The shooting officer was entitled to qualified immunity because the decedent had pointed a loaded gun at officers, refused to lower the gun, and backed into the house, which made the officer feel that he and others were in imminent danger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city, the chief, and the second officer. The court reversed the denial of summary judgment as to the shooting officer and rendered judgment for him. The court also reversed the dismissal of the state tort law claims and remanded those claims to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised 27 issues for review. The supreme court found that defendant did not demonstrate an abuse of discretion by the trial court's denial of the motion for change of venue. Nor did it err in denying defendant funds for his defense to hire an investigator, a jury consultant, limited daily transcripts, additional counsel, and additional psychiatric evaluation. The circuit clerk complied with the statutory requirements in drawing and selecting the jury. The trial court did not err by allowing the State to exercise its peremptory challenges on two black members of the venire as race neutral reasons for striking them were provided. Denial of defendant's request to conduct individual sequestered voir dire was proper. The eyewitness identification was properly not suppressed, as the lineup was not suggestive. The death sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The evidence was more than sufficient to support the jury's finding of the two statutory aggravating circumstances: a capital offense committed in the course of a robbery for pecuniary gain and by person under a sentence of imprisonment, probation, or parole.</SPAN></P>

The execution of the death sentence was stayed pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant challenged her conviction and sentence, raising numerous procedural and evidentiary issues. The supreme court determined that the trial judge did not err by requiring the disclosure of psychiatric reports about defendant to the State prior to the sentencing phase. Defendant failed to show how she was prejudiced by the denial of her motion for a change of venue. Exclusion of a pornographic home video of defendant taken by the victim was not error, as the jury received other evidence showing the victim's abusive and pornographic tendencies. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the statement an investigator took from defendant; defendant repeatedly detailed her involvement in hiring co-defendant to kill the victim in her subsequent statements, which were obtained after she gave separate and adequate consent. As sufficient evidence existed to support the finding that the crime was committed for pecuniary gain and, given the heinous nature of the crime, imposition of the death penalty was neither excessive nor disproportionate in comparison to the crime. Although there were instances of trial court error, the trial was constitutionally fair.</SPAN></P>

Upon his automatic appeal, the convictions and sentences were affirmed. Defendant's petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his post-conviction motion, defendant raised numerous claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial. On review, the supreme court found that it had already addressed the merits on direct appeal of defendant's underlying ineffectiveness claims. Because the supreme court previously held that the underlying claims were without merit, defendant could not show the requisite deficient performance and resulting prejudice necessary to establish the various claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Additional substantive claims raised in the instant application were all held to be procedurally barred and/or addressed on the merits on direct appeal. Since the claims had been addressed on the merits on direct appeal, defendant could not relitigate those claims on post-conviction review as they were res judicata under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21(3). Further, based on the supreme court's prior decision, there were no errors to cumulate; therefore; there was no cumulative error. Defendant demonstrated no reason, singly or cumulatively, warranting his convictions and sentences to be vacated.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that many of his claims for ineffective assistance of counsel were procedurally barred. The remainder of his claims that were not procedurally barred did not pass the Strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel because he could not show deficient performance or that he suffered actual prejudice. Additionally, the inmate's constitutional rights to confront a key witness were not violated by the trial court's refusal to allow him to cross-examine the sheriff about his conviction for extortion which occurred seven years after the sheriff's testimony in the inmate's case. Also, the inmate was not deprived of his right to a fair and impartial jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner murdered two women while attempting to rob one of them and while he was kidnapping both women. The court held that the doctrine of res judicata barred the issue of the trial court's refusal to allow evidence of a sheriff's extortion conviction, which occurred seven years after the sheriff gave testimony against the prisoner during the guilt phase. The issue concerning the trial judge's recusal was also procedurally barred, and the prisoner could not show prejudice because the sheriff's testimony was not the only link to robbery as an aggravating circumstance to the capital murder charge. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to make a Batson challenge, particularly in light of the silent record on the racial composition of the jury and the prisoner's failure to show prejudice. Victim impact evidence was properly admitted, and the State's biblical references did not violate the prisoner's constitutional rights. Two veniremembers who stated they could not impose a death penalty were properly excused for cause. Even if a dictionary was given to the jury, the prisoner failed to show that an extraneous influence was injected into the jury deliberations by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Itawamba County Circuit Court, Mississippi, granted summary judgment in favor of appellee county board of supervisors allowing the county to assess back taxes on a leasehold interest held by appellant holder. The holder appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holder argued that, based on the plain language of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-31-33 (Rev. 2002), the legislature carved out an exemption for private companies holding a leasehold interest in any property owned by a political subdivision that did not exist prior to 1985, at which time the statute became effective. The county's failure to raise the issue of the constitutionality of Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-31-33, 27-31-34 and 27-35-155 at trial resulted in the procedural bar on this issue. The appellate court concluded that, after reviewing legislative history, attorney general opinions, case law, and the unambiguous language of the statutes, a leasehold interest held by a private company was entitled to the exemption provided for under Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-31-33, 27-31-34, and 32-35-155. Because the county admitted to omitting the holder's leasehold interest from the ad valorem tax rolls, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-35-155, the leasehold interest was not subject to ad valorem taxation for any past year that it was not listed on the tax roll. Once the leasehold interest was properly placed on rolls, the county could begin assessing the appropriate ad valorem taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the board of supervisors' orders were set aside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner sought post-conviction relief from the guilty verdicts returned and death sentences imposed for the murders of three members of a family.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims' bodies were found inside their burning house. The victims died from gunshot wounds, while a fourth family member died of smoke inhalation. The court found that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was barred from review by res judicata because the true issue was whether the prisoner's confession was voluntary. The questions of whether the prisoner's trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call his family to corroborate his claim that he was beaten by police, to object to the delay in the prisoner's initial appearance, and to challenge specific portions of the State's case were all without merit. The prisoner could not show how a supposed Brady violation affected the outcome of his case. Had his counsel possessed the transcript of a police officer's testimony from another trial, he would have done the same thing he did, which was to make the point that the officer may have embellished his testimony. The death sentence was not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause as the evidence presented by the State in a trial for the murder of the fourth victim was sufficiently different from the proof presented in the second trial to prove each element of the murders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Tishomingo County Chancery Court, Mississippi, dismissed a complaint for partition and a claim of heirship by appellant, the alleged illegitimate son of the decedent against appellees, the decedent's adopted daughters. The son filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was filed over 18 years after the father's death. The son argued that the time period during which a father could seek an adjudication of paternity under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 91-1-15(3) did not apply to an illegitimate seeking an adjudication of paternity. The court disagreed, holding that the clear language of the statute established that it was applicable to both the natural father inheriting from an illegitimate and to an illegitimate child inheriting from or through the father. The use of the conjunction &quot;and,&quot; indicated that the statute was applicable in either situation. The allegation that the son delayed filing a claim of heirship until the widow died, presumably out of respect for her, did not excuse failing to take timely action to establish paternity. Therefore, the claim for heirship was barred by &sect; 91-1-15. Because they were not raised below, claims were barred with respect tolling the statute of limitations and equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The witness was actively involved in the production of the report and had intimate knowledge of the analysis even though she did not perform the tests first hand. Furthermore, the expert testimony did not concern an essential element of the crime and was not damaging to defendant's case. The testimony was essentially moot to the determination of the case. The witness testified that the tests for semen and blood on a comforter were negative, the tests for blood on the mallet were negative, and the tests from the sexual assault kits for semen were negative. The only potentially damaging testimony was a comment that if digital penetration were the only sexual act performed on the victim, then one would not expect to find semen. Therefore, the trial court clearly did not err in allowing the witness's testimony.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that an ordinary person giving a fair reading of the statute would have concluded that defendant's conduct was prohibited and that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-41-16 (2000) was not unconstitutionally vague such that it would not have given defendant sufficient notice that the conduct in which he engaged was proscribed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction of a lesser-included charge of manslaughter based upon a jury verdict from the Cohoma County Circuit Court (Mississippi), asserting that his constitutional right to the nature and notice of the charge was violated by the lack of a stated means of homicide in the indictment, that the court committed evidentiary errors, and that the verdict was not supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant arrived at a nightclub where his sister was fighting with a male. After firing his gun into the air, defendant was rushed by the male and his two brothers, and defendant shot them, killing one. Witnesses testified that defendant was free from the grasp of the victims before he shot them, and the jury rejected self-defense. Defendant first argued that the homicide statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-7-37 (2000), was constitutionally defective because it did not require the inclusion in the indictment of a specific overt act by which the murder was allegedly committed. The trial court had allowed the State to amend the indictment to allege &quot;by shooting with a pistol,&quot; and it was clear from the record that defendant was not prejudiced in the preparation of his defense by the indictment. The supreme court found no error where medical record evidence of one of the victim's statement to a doctor that his fellow victim went on a &quot;rampage&quot; was not made for treatment purposes under Miss. R. Evid. 803(4). Finally, the supreme court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict, as there was sufficient credible, corroborated eyewitness testimony of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital murder in the Newton County Circuit Court (Mississippi) and sentenced to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that he was entitled to a trial by jury on the issue of his mental retardation for execution purposes. The supreme court agreed. Defendant had a verbal IQ of 65, a performance IQ of 60, for a full scale IQ of 60 on the Wechsler Test. On another test called the Shipley, an expert witness found that defendant had an estimated IQ of 50, which also fell within the mildly retarded range. Defendant was reading at a second grade level and capable of doing math at a first grade level. Defendant spent three years in third grade and he acted strangely at times. The expert stated that if he had known about defendant's schizophrenia, he might have made different findings on the issues of IQ and retardation; the original report showed that the expert was aware of defendant's claim of hearing voices, of considering suicide, of difficulties in school, and of being disabled. Defendant produced enough evidence to be granted leave to proceed in the trial court on the issue of his mental retardation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's application for leave to file petition for post-conviction relief was granted, limited to the following issues: (1) mental retardation; (2) ineffective assistance of counsel on the issue of mental illness and (3) ineffective assistance of counsel on the issue of competency. The application was otherwise denied. The State's motion to strike defendant's rebuttal brief was denied.</SPAN></P>

Because of the death sentence, however, the high court reviewed his claims on the merits as well. It reiterated its determination, from prior case law, that the Mississippi death penalty statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101, was not violative of due process or guarantees against cruel and unusual punishment, and that petitioner could not show that any supposed error at trial or deficiency of counsel affected his outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a capital murder case, defendant was sentenced to death on remand by a second sentencing jury of the Sunflower County Circuit Court (Mississippi). Defendant filed an amended petition for post-conviction relief, the State filed its response, defendant filed a second amendment and reply to response, and the State filed its response.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death for the murder of a corrections officer. Defendant raised a significant number of issues for post-conviction relief. The supreme court denied relief on all issues but one, that being defendant's claim that he was mentally retarded. The supreme court held that not being mentally retarded was not an aggravating factor necessary for imposition of the death penalty, and the Ring standard, requiring a finding of aggravating circumstances necessary for imposition of the death penalty to be found by a jury, had no application to an Atkins v. Virginia determination, prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded offenders. The burden of proof for the issue was on defendant. One doctor testified that defendant was mildly retarded, while another doctor testified that defendant's IQ was borderline low to normal and he was not retarded. After thorough consideration, the supreme court found that defendant should be granted leave to proceed in the trial court on the sole issue of whether he was mentally retarded such that he could not be executed under Atkins.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amended petition for post-conviction relief was denied except for the sole ground of defendant's alleged mental retardation. Defendant was granted leave to proceed in the trial court on the sole issue of whether he was mentally retarded such that he could not be executed under Atkins v. Virginia. The standard or definition of mental retardation was to be that enunciated in Atkins, and the issue was to be decided without a jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being charged with capital rape, appellant inmate pled guilty to the charge of sexual battery and was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment, with 10 suspended. He filed a petition for post-conviction relief drawn up by appellant writ writer. The Circuit Court of Marion County, Mississippi, summarily dismissed the petition as frivolous and sanctioned both the inmate and the writ writer for filing a frivolous pleading. Both men appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, who was 23 years old at the time of the crime, confessed to raping an 11-year-old girl. The inmate underwent extensive psychiatric examinations at the state hospital. Physicians concluded the inmate was not mentally retarded, but rather somewhat limited intellectually. Upon review, the supreme court held that the relevant statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-95 (Rev. 2000) was not unconstitutionally vague and that there was little doubt that &sect; 97-3-95 gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that the inmate's conduct was forbidden. Indeed, the inmate himself admitted that he knew what he wanted to do was wrong, but he did it anyway. The court also concluded that the record showed the inmate was competent to stand trial, even though the inmate claimed otherwise. Two separate psychiatric evaluations showed he was competent to stand trial and competent to have understood the difference between right and wrong. Because most of the inmate's post-conviction petition was at least arguable, the merits of the other issues raised in the petition should have been addressed and sanctions should not have been imposed. Nevertheless, the summary dismissal was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the dismissal of the inmate's petition and reversed and rendered the imposition of sanctions against both the inmate and the writ writer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family court of Harrison County, First Judicial District (Mississippi), adjudicated appellant father as the natural father of appellee mother's child, and set child support and visitation. Later the family court was abolished. The father sought to modify a prior order, and was instructed to file the matter in the Harrison County Youth Court. The youth court denied a motion to transfer the matter to the chancery court. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1995 the family court entered a judgment adjudicating the father to be the natural father of the subject child, and set forth child support obligations, and a visitation schedule for the minor child. However, in 1999, the legislature abolished the family court. Then, in 2001, the father sought to modify certain provisions of the family court's prior orders. The youth court judge concluded that he had no authority to transfer the matter to the chancery court. The appellate court disagreed. The appellate court stated that nowhere did the Youth Court Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-21-101 et seq., provide for it taking jurisdiction over a case involving exclusively child support, contempt, and modification issues (as opposed to abuse issues). Further, paternity actions (the subject of the original action here) could never be brought in youth court. No allegations of abuse, neglect, or delinquency had been asserted, thus the matter was not one for which the youth court had been granted jurisdiction. Furthermore, the matter, was not &quot;pending&quot; within the meaning of the law repealing the family court. Thus, jurisdiction was properly in the chancery court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held the original paternity action could not have been brought in youth court. No allegations of abuse, neglect, or delinquency had been asserted, thus the matter was not one for which the youth court had been granted jurisdiction. The appellate court reversed the youth court's retention of jurisdiction, and remanded the matter for transfer to the chancery court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered summary judgment for the foundation, thereby ratifying the lease. The secretary of state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district acquired title to sixteenth section land that it used to build two schools. The property also had an historic home on it, which it leased to the foundation to preserve it. The lease provided for the nominal rental fee of $ 1 per year for five years with certain renewal rights. After the secretary of state questioned the constitutionality of the lease, the foundation was successful in the trial court in having the lease confirmed and ratified. The appellate court initially noted that, under Miss. Const. art. IV, &sect; 95, lands belonging to or under the control of the state shall not be donated directly or indirectly to private corporations, private individuals, or to railroad companies or sold to corporations or associations for a less price than that for which it was subject to sale to individuals. The appellate court held the school board simply had no authority to lease the property on the terms that it did to the foundation and, because the $ 1 per year nominal rental was insufficient consideration, it amounted to an unconstitutional donation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and judgment rendered such that the foundation's complaint was dismissed with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipalities sued appellee Mississippi State Tax Commission (MSTC) to require the MSTC to comply with state law in its diversion of state sales tax funds to the cities. The Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi) granted the MSTC's motion to dismiss pursuant to, inter alia, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-65-75 (1972) and 27-3-57. The municipalities appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the lawsuit was pending, the legislature enacted 2000 Miss. Laws 304, which abated any suits brought by a municipality to recover additional payments under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-65-75 (1972) in excess of the amounts authorized in 2000 Miss. Laws 304. The trial court held that the municipalities lacked standing, and were also precluded from maintaining the suit by 2000 Miss. Laws 304. The supreme court held that the trial court erred in ruling that the municipalities lacked standing; they had a colorable interest in the subject matter of the suit, and Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 7-7-67 and 7-7-71 (Rev. 2002) did not bestow exclusive authority to the Mississippi State Auditor to bring such an action. But it agreed with the trial court that 2000 Miss. Laws 304 barred the suit. This statute was constitutional. It did not violate the separation of powers doctrine since it did not revive the right to bring the same suit in the name of another. Nor did it violate the non-delegation doctrine by setting no standards to guide the MSTC, as Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-65-93 (Rev. 2000) authorized the MSTC to promulgate rules and regulations deemed necessary to enforce the provisions of &sect; 27-65-93.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted of four counts of capital murder and was sentenced to death. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, then 16, bludgeoned his mother and three other family members to death, and fled in his slain relative's car. He confessed; blood on his clothing matched the blood types of the victims. The supreme court held that many of the contentions in the petition were procedurally barred under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-21(1) and (3) (Supp. 2002), as they were either not been raised at trial or on appeal, or were raised and decided adversely to him. Further, none of the contentions had merit. An instruction which required the jury to consider whether the crimes were especially heinous, atrocious or cruel was proper. While the instruction on the &quot;great risk of death&quot; aggravator instruction did not recite that petitioner &quot;knowingly&quot; created the risk, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find he knowingly put his family in jeopardy. Even if this aggravating circumstance were invalid, the remaining aggravating circumstances supported imposing the death penalty. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to do more than just file a motion to transfer the case to youth court, as under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-21-151, petitioner had not been within the jurisdiction of that court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff retired state employee appealed from a Hinds Chancery Court (Mississippi) order dismissing for failure to state a claim his complaint against defendant officials, in which he challenged the existence of the Mississippi Supplemental Legislative Retirement Plan, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 25-11-301 to -3109 (1999 &amp; Supp. 2002) (SLRP), as violative of the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Like all other retired state employees, the employee received retirement benefits under the Mississippi Public Employees' Retirement System, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 25-11-1 to 25-11-145 (1999 &amp; Supp. 2002) (PERS). His constitutional challenge to the SLRP benefit was based on the argument that the legislators had provided a special benefit to themselves in addition to their PERS eligibility. Applying a presumption of constitutionality, the high court reviewed federal constitutional case law dealing with public employee benefit programs, and held that under the standards applied in that area of law, since treating different groups of employees did not amount to a suspect classification, it would examine the legislative scheme solely to determine whether it had a rational basis. The legislature's stated purpose of protecting legislators against the uncertainty of their tenure and the time taken away from their private careers survived that level of scrutiny. Inclusion of the lieutenant governor in SLRP was permissible because she performed some legislative functions. If the employee regarded that situation as unfair, he would have to seek a political remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former wife appealed from those aspects of a judgment of the Hinds County Chancery Court (Mississippi) that granted defendant former husband a divorce on his counterclaim seeking divorce on the grounds of adultery, relating to custody, a prenuptial agreement, alimony, and property distribution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties executed a prenuptial agreement before their marriage, and kept much of their property separate throughout the marriage. The high court reviewed with deference the chancellor's findings. If it was error to exclude a marriage counselor's testimony offered by the wife, it was harmless error, because there was plenty of similar expert testimony regarding custody issues. Although the wife argued after the fact that she had impliedly petitioned for joint custody, which the trial court would have granted if requested, the record supported the trial court's determination that neither party had requested it, so it was unavailable under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-5-24 (1994 &amp; Supp. 2002). Since the evidence indicated that the prenuptial agreement was voluntarily entered with full disclosure, it was properly enforced, and although the wife had less property than the husband, she was provided for amply enough; alimony was not necessary. Finally, equitable considerations did not require that the husband's considerable inherited property be included in the pool for equitable distribution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the objectors, Lamar County, its Board of Supervisors, and others, challenged the Lamar County Chancery Court's (Mississippi), entry of a final judgment which had the practical effect of granting appellee City of Hattiesburg's petition to annex five separate and non-contiguous parcels of land located in neighboring Lamar County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment at issue had the practical effect of causing Hattiesburg (the county seat of Forrest County) to move further into Lamar County. Appellants raised three issues: (1) whether the chancery court erred in its order wherein it allowed the City to amend the legal description of the area proposed for annexation; (2) whether it erred in not dismissing the case once it went to trial as there were still errors with the legal description at the time of trial; and, (3) whether it erred in determining that the proposed annexation by the City was reasonable. Regarding the first two issues, appellants claimed that the legal description errors were so egregious that they deprived the chancery court of jurisdiction, but the court concluded that appellants were in no way prejudiced by the amended descriptions. It also rejected appellants' argument that the practice of liberal amendments to pleadings, as permitted in Miss. R. Civ. P. 15, did not pertain to annexations. As to reasonableness, the court reviewed the 12 relevant indicia, and found that the chancery court's findings were supported by substantial evidence. Finally, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-1-27 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hinds County Circuit Court, Mississippi, granted summary judgment in favor of appellee physician based upon his employment status at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in appellant estate administrator's medical malpractice case arising under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-46-1 to -23 (Rev. 2002). The administrator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator argued that the trial court erred in finding that the physician was an employee of the university medical center and was acting within the course and scope of his employment during the course of his treatment with the patient. The appellate court found that the physician was an employee of the medical center. The physician was the admitting physician assigned to the hospital on the day the patient was admitted and did not come into contact with the physician until his rounds the next morning. Because the patient was a Medicaid patient, doctors did not receive direct payment from Medicaid patients. The existence of professional liability insurance did not waive a state employee's immunity. The administrator's failure to raise the issue of constitutionality of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-7(2) before the trial court or notify the attorney general's office of his challenge of the statute resulted in the procedural bar on the issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Harrison County Circuit Court, Mississippi, dismissed a complaint filed, pro se, by plaintiff father against defendant Mississippi Department of Human Services alleging the Department improperly took custody of the father's son. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department first argued that the father's claim was improperly before the circuit court. The appellate court found there was no evidence in the record of any appeal taken from the judgment of the youth court, much less any appeal taken within the requisite 10 days. The father filed a complaint almost a year and a half later. The filing of an original circuit court complaint against the Department was not the appropriate remedy for seeking relief. Proper service, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11(1) (2002), would have been had on the chief executive officer of the Department. There was no attempt by the father to serve the chief executive officer, or anyone at the Department. The action was not filed within the statutory time period. The father did not do that which was required under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11 of the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 11-46-1 to -23 (2002), to sue a governmental entity. The Department was authorized to take a child into custody by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-21-301(2000) when there was an order by the judge which met certain criteria. There was no evidence supporting any of the father's allegations against the Department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Warren County Circuit Court (Mississippi) enjoined appellant board of aldermen from closing an airport and ruled it was obliged to create a separate corporate authority before jointly operating a second airport with a Louisiana city. The board and appellee businesses sought review. In a second case, the businesses appealed dismissal of their appeal of the board's creation of a municipal airport authority and its appointment of commissioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board executed an agreement with Louisiana entities, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 61-3-7, to create an airport (airport 2) and an authority to run it and to close an existing airport (airport 1). Later, the board voted to close airport 1. The businesses sued to keep airport 1 open and to recover from board members all tax money the board spent on airport 2. The circuit court, citing Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 61-3-5 and 61-3-7, ruled the board could not conduct joint operations with Louisiana entities or fund airport 2 until it created a separate airport authority. The board then voted to create a municipal airport authority and appointed its commissioners. The businesses filed the second suit, alleging, inter alia, that two of the appointed commissioners were ineligible for service. A different judge of the same circuit court affirmed the board's creation of the authority and its appointments. The supreme court held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-51-75 (2002), which authorized the circuit court's review of the board's actions, did not also empower that court to grant injunctive relief. The board's closure of airport 1 was not arbitrary or capricious. The businesses' appeal lacked merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court was reversed in the first case insofar as it overturned the board's order closing airport 1, found that airport 1 had been dedicated by implication to the public for use as an airport, and issued a permanent injunction. That case was remanded with orders to the circuit court to lift the permanent injunction. The remaining orders in the first case and all orders in the second case were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A locomotive belonging to railroad collided with a vehicle driven by the mother and occupied by two of her sons, all who died in the collision. The grandmother witnessed the accident. On appeal, the railroad raised 29 issues on appeal, including the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, Batson problems, numerous evidentiary decisions, failure of the jury to deliberate adequately, a claim that the verdict was excessive, that the punitive damages verdict violated the United States and Mississippi constitutions, and that the 15 percent statutory penalty was unconstitutional. The supreme court found nearly all of the issues to be without merit. However, the supreme court held that there was no evidence that anyone ignored the railroad's vegetation policy, and this was not willful, egregious behavior. Thus, the conduct involved did not rise to the level which would warrant punitive damages. Additionally, the grandmother's vague testimony regarding visits to the psychiatrist could not support a damage award for emotional distress, and she failed to offer substantive proof for her claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the judgment below, with the exception of the grandmother's damage award on her negligent infliction of emotional distress claim and the punitive damages award, both of which were reversed and rendered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mother and Department of Human Services (DHS), challenged a judgment of the Youth Court Division of the County Court of Forrest County (Mississippi), granting durable legal custody of the child to long-time foster parents, and extinguishing the necessity for DHS to oversee and monitor the case and fulfill the requirement of annual reviews. In response, the foster parents filed briefs in support of the youth court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was placed in the physical custody of the foster parents after being adjudicated abused. The primary issue raised by the mother for consideration on appeal was whether the youth court erred in granting durable legal custody to the foster parents rather than reuniting the mother with her child. The supreme court held that the youth court did not err in ordering that it was in the best interest of the child to grant durable legal custody to the foster parents, based on the child's situation of chronic abuse and long-term physical placement with the same foster family. Additionally, the mother argued that the 1998 amendments by the Mississippi Legislature to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 43-21-609(b), creating durable legal custody as a dispositional alternative, were unconstitutional, but the supreme court refused to address the issue on appeal, because the mother did not raise her constitutional challenges at the youth court level. Finally, the supreme court held that the youth court erred in relieving DHS in the case, as the intent of durable legal custody was merely to avoid the required annual dispositional reviews, not a complete preclusion of further involvement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The youth court's judgment was affirmed as to granting durable legal custody to the foster parents, and reversed and remanded back to the youth court in order to correct the remainder of its judgment regarding relieving DHS from having any further involvement in the placement of the child.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, asserting the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing him to the maximum period of confinement allowed by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police were dispatched to a store pursuant to an alarm call and found defendant in the building. Outside a door were boxes of boots usually kept inside the store. A broken window was found with defendant's footprints below the window. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that his sentence was disproportionate or cruel and unusual in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Miss. Const. art. 3, &sect; 28. Mississippi case law provided that sentencing was at the discretion of the trial court, and not subject to appellate review if it was within the limits prescribed by statute. Here, the maximum sentence for burglary was seven years. Further, where a sentence did not exceed statutory limits, it did not constitute cruel and inhuman treatment. The trial court found that defendant had previously been convicted of numerous misdemeanor crimes. The fact that defendant was convicted of a felony for the first time, did not preclude a sentence for the maximum statutory limit. Finally, the appellate court held it was not bound to analyze the sentence pursuant to a three-prong test for an Eighth Amendment proportionality analysis as set forth by the United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, insurer and financing corporation, appealed, and appellee, insured's wife, cross-appealed after the Jones County Circuit Court (Mississippi) entered directed verdicts in favor of the wife, the jury awarded the punitive damages, the award was remitted, and the Mississippi Court of Appeals reversed the trial court on all questions except the award of compensatory damages against the insurer, in a premium refund case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When purchasing a truck, the insured also chose to obtain credit life insurance. The corporation advanced the premium and added it to the principal of the installment contract for the truck. The insured traded the truck for a smaller model and the installment loan was satisfied, and the insurer was then holding unearned premiums. After the insured died, the wife filed suit for failure to timely refund the unaccrued credit life insurance premium. On appeal, the corporation argued the trial court erred in directing verdict against it. The supreme court held that while there was evidence of a conspiracy between the corporation and insurer, it was not of such a nature as to take it out of the province of the jury. The wife argued on appeal that the court of appeals improperly reversed the punitive damage award against the insurer. The supreme court held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 83-53-17(2) did not contain a notice requirement, and that while punitive damages were warranted by the insurer's conduct, the award was grossly excessive, as the trial was sufficiently flawed due to numerous prejudicial errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed and remanded the case as to the corporation for a new trial in harmony with the opinion, and reversed and remanded as to the insurer for a new trial on the amount of punitive damages awarded against it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The LeFlore County Circuit Court, Mississippi, entered a permanent injunction in favor of appellee estate against appellant medical examiner preventing her from performing an autopsy on the body of the deceased in order to determine the cause of his death. The examiner and State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted that, under the plain language of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-61-65(3) (2001), the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case, as the estate failed to exhaust administrative remedies by first appealing to the State Medical Examiner for further review. The appellate court found that the legislature did not intend that a deceased person's burial be delayed indefinitely while his next-of-kin pursued administrative hearings. The trial court was permitted to take immediate jurisdiction without the exhaustion of administrative remedies. The circuit erred by ordering that an autopsy not be done, as it involved a death affecting the public interest, as defined in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-61-59(2) (2001). Violent death, including homicide, and suicidal or accidental death were statutorily defined as affecting the public interest such that a coroner's decision to order an autopsy was proper. The only purpose for taking the bodily fluids was to help determine the cause of death. The record was devoid of any postmortem privacy interest the decedent could have that outweighed public interest in determining the circumstances surrounding an accidental death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A caretaker of defendant's two-year-old daughter discovered the child had bruises all over her body. An emergency room physician found the child dehydrated, malnourished, and with numerous injuries. All of the child's bruises and abrasions caused temporary disfigurement. Each of the child's parents blamed the other for some of the abuse of the child. On appeal, defendant argued the child's bruises were not enough evidence to convict her under the felony child abuse statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-5-39(2) (2000). The supreme court disagreed. It found the instant case did not involve just a few bruises, but rather was a severe case, which clearly met the established felony criteria. The court held that &quot;serious bodily harm,&quot; as it pertained to &sect; 97-5-39(2), was any physical injury that amounted to child maltreatment such as death, or permanent or temporary disfigurement, or impairment of any function of any bodily organ or function. The supreme court also concluded the trial court did not err in holding that acts of omission, such as allowing a child to become dehydrated and malnourished, were adequate to constitute felony child abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that a strict interpretation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-9(1)(m) &amp; (n) violated the Remedy Clause, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Mississippi and United States Constitutions. The appellate court held that the remedy clause did not require exceptions to sovereign immunity and did not grant an absolute guarantee of a trial. There was no property right to sue the State or other governmental entities, and therefore no due process violation of the Mississippi Constitution. This applied to the United States Constitution, as state law defined property interests, and there were no exceptions to overcome sovereign immunity. In the Tort Claims Act, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-7 (Supp. 2001), the legislature provided for an exemption from the government's liability for claims made by inmates. No exceptions, restrictions, or distinctions were made to allow an inmate to bring a claim against a governmental entity. There was no genuine issue of material fact, as the inmate was an inmate of the Mississippi Department of Corrections and in the custody of the work center at the time his claim occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners obtained a permit from the state to construct their pier, which stated the tidal wetlands crossed by the pier belonged to the state. On appeal, the landowner argued the state was precluded from claiming ownership of the disputed land because it was not shown on the public trust tidelands map, and that his riparian rights were violated when the homeowners built the pier and when the state intervened. The appellate court initially noted title to tidelands could not be lost via adverse possession, limitations, or by laches, and under no circumstances could title held by the state for the public use or benefit be lost. The appellate court held although the disputed land had not originally appeared on the map of public trust tidelands, the legislature's goal of establishing certain and stable land titles did not contemplate a loss of public trust lands because of an oversight in the mapping process. The appellate court held the landowner's riparian rights were not affected as the homeowners obtained a permit from the state granting them littoral rights to the subject property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that: (1) he was entitled to a mistrial because of comments made by one of the prospective jurors to the effect that defendant had terrorized her during her childhood; (2) his constitutional and statutory right to a speedy trial was violated; and (3) the trial court made erroneous rulings on jury instructions. The instant court found that because the trial court conducted an examination, and because of the brevity of the prospective juror's comment, the comment was not substantially prejudicial so as to warrant a mistrial. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial. Defendant was responsible for most of the delay in bringing the case to trial. Defendant failed to show any real prejudice, as he did not state or prove any exculpatory evidence which would have been available had he been brought to trial earlier. The trial court did not err in refusing defendant's requested instruction on manslaughter, as there was no evidence to support such an instruction.

The attorney general allowed the IHL to establish a full four year university on the coast. Appellees filed suit, claiming that the IHL violated Mississippi law in allowing the university to begin offering freshman and sophomore courses as part of its curriculum. The supreme court held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 7-5-1 required consent of the attorney general prior to filing suit between state agencies. Appellees did not receive consent prior to filing suit; therefore the suit was procedurally barred. The IHL created a dual campus, rather than an off-campus when it created the coast location; therefore, state law was not violated. The supreme court also held that the SBCJS could not be established as a body with veto power over the IHL's constitutionally mandated power to manage and control the state's universities; therefore, &sect; 37-102-3 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-29-31 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the Mississippi Constitution. Defendant claimed that the statute was vague because it failed to specify the conduct prohibited, and that the terms &quot;lewdly,&quot; &quot;person,&quot; &quot;private parts,&quot; and &quot;public place&quot; were not defined. The appellate court found that the statute did not define the terms, yet the statute was not ambiguous, and the appellate court applied the statute according to its plain meaning without further use of the principles of statutory construction. A common sense reading of the statute adequately provided an individual of common intelligence an understanding and notice of what conduct was acceptable or prohibited. Defendant's examples of situations in which the statute was overbroad were unpersuasive. The statute only prohibited nudity accompanied by lewdness. Certain conduct was allowed, in cases where serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value were present. Defendant did not demonstrate a real or substantial effect on a legitimate expression.</SPAN></P>

He could not locate the car keys, so he obtained a duplicate key. He opened the trunk and found the victim's body inside. It was later determined she had died from manual strangulation. Defendant was identified as a person likely involved in the death. Defendant was found wandering along a road. He denied knowing the victim. At the police station, a set of keys which were later determined to be the victim's house and car keys where found in defendant's back pocket. Investigators found defendant's clothes had spots of blood on them. At trial, the doctor who performed the autopsy explained how the strangulation caused a slow, heinous death. After defendant was convicted and sentenced to death, the state supreme court found: (1) the evidence was sufficient to prove the underlying felony of robbery, (2) the evidence supported the heinous, atrocious, or cruel jury instruction that was given, (3) the heinous, atrocious, or cruel jury instruction was constitutionally adequate, and (4) the death sentence was not disproportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following separate trials in the county justice court and the municipal court, defendant was convicted of a total of seven counts of animal cruelty. Defendant appealed from both courts to the Circuit Court of Pearl River County (Mississippi) where the cases were consolidated. Following a jury trial in the circuit court, defendant was convicted of one count of animal cruelty. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court's instruction was erroneous because it did not require the jury to find his acts motivated by a spirit of cruelty. The supreme court, although the argument was not raised by either the State or defendant, determined that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-41-1 was unconstitutionally vague and agreed that defendant had no way of knowing, from a fair reading of &sect; 97-41-1, whether his discretion in choosing to mend his horse's broken leg without paying for a specialist would result in a violation of the statute. The supreme court agreed with defendant that as the statute contained no language of intent coupled with motive, his only choices were to have the horse destroyed or take the horse to have him treated by experts, a costly endeavor. The court found that the statute, without words of intent and motive, left defendant no room for using his own discretion in deciding whether he would be able to heal his own horse without having to destroy it. The supreme court therefore held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-41-1 was unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the decision of the trial courts and rendered judgment for defendant.</SPAN></P>

The trials were severed. Change of venue just for jury selection was granted. The Jackson County Circuit Court, Mississippi, by jury, convicted defendant on all three counts. He was sentenced to separate life sentences for the kidnapping and rape, and to death by lethal injection on the capital murder charge. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his ex-brother-in-law owed a drug dealer money. Defendant, a butcher, sharpened all his work knives and took them home for a weekend. The dealer and his girlfriend visited defendant's home where the ex-in-law shot the dealer, defendant bound and raped the girlfriend and cut up the dealer's corpse, and the two culprits dropped his body parts in the bayou. Defendant confessed to a friend. The supreme court held that as the evidence showed a planned assault, self-defense and manslaughter jury instructions were properly denied. An alleged prior bad act by the homicide victim was properly excluded as no overt act by him against the culprits was shown except defendant's testimony. The fact that the actual moment of the victim's death preceded consummation of the robbery did not vitiate the capital charge. An off-handed witness reference to defendant &quot;in prison,&quot; during defense counsel's questioning, was not incurably prejudicial to defendant. Contamination of the neighborhood's waters, intending to attract alligators, satisfied Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101(5)(c)'s &quot;great risk of death to many persons&quot; aggravating circumstance. Jury sequestration was adequate.</SPAN></P>

Instead, a private individual built the building and signed a lease-purchase agreement with the county. The officials unsuccessfully sought a bond issue to pay for this, and then obtained private legislation allowing the local development authority to borrow the necessary money, which was to be retired by a special tax. As no tax was yet levied, the taxpayers were not deprived of any constitutionally protected property interest. Competitive bidding was not required, as the development authority bought the building after its was built and leased it back to the employer. The taxpayers received all the results of the bond election they were entitled to, which was that no bond issued. The officials' decision to seek an alternate financing method was not subject to judicial review. The private legislation did not violate the constitution's prohibition of special laws benefitting individuals, as that did not apply to public bodies. The officials were immune from the taxpayers' claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Quitman County Circuit Court (Mississippi) against defendants, governor and attorney general. The county alleged that the state breached its duties under Mississippi law by forcing the county to fund representation of indigent criminal defendants. The trial court denied the state's motion to dismiss. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state argued that the county lacked standing because the complaint did not name any person who had been deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. The supreme court disagreed because the county was particularly interested in the funding scheme as it was the entity required to provide indigent defense funding and it experienced an adverse effect from the state's failure to provide funding for indigent defendants. For these reasons, the supreme court held that the county had standing to bring this action against the state. The state argued that the county's allegations could not overcome the presumption of constitutionality afforded the statutes at issue and that the financing of public defenders was a legislative matter for which the courts could provide no remedy. The supreme court disagreed because it was not the funding that the county argued was unconstitutionally shifted to the counties, but the obligation of indigent defense. The supreme court concluded that the county pleaded facts that were sufficient to demonstrate that the state breached its constitutional duty to provide indigent defendants with effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grandparents brought an action in the Alcorn County Chancery Court (Mississippi) against defendant parents seeking visitation with their grandchild. The trial court granted visitation to the grandparents. In certain post judgment proceedings, the trial court found the parents in contempt and denied the parents' motion for relief from judgment. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents argued that the Mississippi Grandparents' Visitation Act was unconstitutional because it allowed the trial court to disregard a decision of a fit parent. The supreme court disagreed because the statute specifically limited the court's ability to order grandparent visitation. The parents argued that the chancellor misapplied the statute and, therefore, the order of grandparent visitation was in error. The supreme court agreed because the chancellor never made an express finding that visitation was in the child's best interest as required by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-16-3(2), much less a finding that overnight and unsupervised visitation was in his best interest, there was no evidence to support the chancellor's belated finding that the parents had &quot;unreasonably' withheld visitation and each mental health professional that testified opined that visitation was not in the best interest of the child. The parents argued that the chancellor erred when he found them in contempt. The supreme court disagreed because even though the judgment in question was not properly executed and served, that did not relieve them of obedience to the earlier, interim, order for visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment of the chancellor and render judgment for the parents on the issue of visitation, affirmed as to contempt for failure to comply with the court's orders, and remanded for determination of attorney's fees for the parents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for selling cocaine to an undercover police officer on or about January 26, 1996. On October 10, 1996, defendant was convicted pursuant to a guilty plea and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. On October, 12, 2000, defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief. Defendant's petition for post conviction collateral relief was dismissed by the trial court on the grounds it was statutorily time barred. The trial court did not address the petition's merits. After the petition was dismissed, the appellate court found that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(1), (2) (2000) dictated that a prisoner in custody had three years from the time he pled guilty in which to file a claim for postconviction relief. It further found that because defendant's petition for postconviction relief was filed more than four years after he was convicted, the trial court did not err in dismissing his petition as time barred. It further found that dismissing his petition without considering its merits, on time limitations grounds, violated neither his federal nor state constitutional rights as statutes of limitations served the important goal of helping the courts manage their business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found in a shed connected to a house by a common roof and ceiling, separated by a breezeway. Defendant did not show beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute defining a dwelling, for purposes of a burglary charge, was unconstitutionally vague, and his burglary of the outbuilding was a burglary of a dwelling. Defendant agreed at pre-trial hearings to be represented by counsel, allowed counsel to conduct his trial, and fully participated in the new trial motion hearing. His right to self-representation was not denied. A threshold comparison of defendant's crime to his sentence did not require application of the three-part sentence proportionality test by being grossly disproportionate, making statistics regarding sentences for similar crimes in neighboring counties irrelevant. Defendant had 16 prior convictions and was correctly found to be an habitual offender. The fact that defendant's sentence was more severe than that offered in a plea bargain did not mean defendant received a harsher sentence for exercising his right to trial.</SPAN></P>

With his motion to suppress, defendant claimed police beat him with a cane to get his statement. Officers admitted they had had a cane but claimed it was either for an injury or a stolen cane case. At trial, defendant completely contradicted his confession. The Mississippi Supreme Court held that defendant did not prove Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-65(3)(a), the rape statute, unconstitutionally vague. His indictment had not required the words &quot;without consent&quot; where force was involved. The victim's hospital statements were properly admitted as Miss. R. Evid. 803(2), (4) exceptions to the hearsay rule. As the trial court had immediately restored order both when the victim appeared to faint during cross-examination and later when she declared, &quot;Liar,&quot; from the audience during closing arguments, mistrial was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

The girl, hiding after she was shot, heard defendant tell his ex-wife that he had said that he would kill her. Defendant returned home. Before his wife and brother he said he killed a family. Later in jail he told his wife where he had hidden the shotgun. The Mississippi Supreme Court held that the multiple count indictment did not warrant severance. The murder of the children and injuring of his daughter constituted felonious child abuse which both acted as the underlying element of the burglary and elevated the murders to capital murder. Defendant's peremptory challenge rights were not abused under Batson principles. Defendant's wife's testimony was not excludable under the Miss. R. Evid. 504 marriage privilege. Defendant's counsel admitted defendant was not insane under M'Naghten. Defendant never alleged he could not differentiate between right and wrong.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff amusement center owners filed two separate complaints in two counties regarding the propriety of defendant Mississippi Gaming Commission's seizure of certain amusement devices. The Union County Chancery Court, Mississippi, and the Washington County Circuit Court, Mississippi, ruled the majority of the owners' machines had been illegally seized. The commission appealed the trial courts' decisions to the Mississippi Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One group of the owners sought clarification and interpretation of the Mississippi gaming laws as to the criteria for determining the legality of certain amusement devices owned and/or leased by the specific group of the owners and seized by the commission, on the grounds they were illegal gambling devices. One trial court found the statute in question, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 75-76-5(ff) (2000), required proof of a payoff before the commission could have seized a machine under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-33-7(1) (2000). The second trial court agreed with the payoff requirement. Both trial courts concluded the commission improperly seized most of the owners' amusement devices. The appeals court disagreed, concluding that where the elements of consideration and chance were present, &sect; 75-76-5(ff) required only that the machines possess the &quot;potential for reward&quot; to be considered a slot machine subject to seizure and destruction under &sect; 97-33-7(1). The award of credits by one type of machine to play free additional games was something of value. Thus, the gaming device was illegal under state law and subject to seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed the trial courts' judgments and rendered judgments in favor of the commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of killing three victims, including a 13-year-old, who suffered severe chop wounds to their heads, and was sentenced to death for one of the murders. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. Defendant sought post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the victim's bodies were found, bloody shoe prints leading in the direction of defendant's home were found. Defendant admitted to going out-of-state, buying a gun, and registering under a different name in the days after the crime when he knew the sheriff was looking for him. Defendant's friend, as part of a plea bargain in a separate matter, testified that defendant had gone to the 13-year-old's home to have sex with her and that he had beaten her. Defendant was convicted. The Mississippi Supreme Court held that as defendant was under a suspended sentence at the time, he was &quot;under sentence of imprisonment&quot; for purposes of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-101(5)(a) aggravating factors. Many issues he raised were procedurally barred. Counsel's failure to investigate the story of a man in the woods weeks after the crime was not ineffective assistance, nor was the failure to investigate a potential witness who claimed nothing more specific than that the sheriff had a reputation for dishonesty. Defendant was not constitutionally entitled to effective assistance of an expert psychological witness. Counsel was not in conflict for having previously represented someone remotely suspect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment based on a jury verdict from the Marion County Court (Mississippi), convicting defendant for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, and sentencing defendant as a habitual offender for the felony offense of sale or transfer of a controlled substance within 1,500 feet of a school, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-29-139, 41-29-142, 41-29-147.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant negotiated for the sale of crack cocaine with agents in planned drug purchase, from which an audio and video recording was made. The cocaine was placed in a sealed bag in an evidence locker and later tested. After defendant was convicted, he was sentenced as a habitual offender and his motion for a new trial or JNOV was denied. The appellate court held that the State's juror challenges did not suggest a pattern or raise an inference of discrimination, and there was not a reasonable inference of tampering or substitution of evidence, as defendant failed to break the chain of custody; thus the evidence supported the verdict of guilty. However, the testimony of an officer revealed that the drug transaction took place approximately 1,105 feet from a school. Miss. Code. Ann. &sect; 41-29-142 denoted measuring points for sentencing enhancement to be 1,500 feet from the school building or outbuilding or 1,000 feet from the real property comprising the school. Because the testimony was imprecise and failed to prove the transaction occurred within either of the distances provided by the statute, the proof failed and the sentencing enhancement was not applicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the appellate court concluded that the trial judge improperly applied the sentence enhancement for a sale of a controlled substance within 1,500 feet of a school, it reversed and remanded for resentencing without the enhancement. In all other respects, it affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court also held that the arresting officer's questioning of defendant were part of his general on-the-scene investigation; therefore, Miranda warnings were not required and the trial court did not err in failing to suppress her statements made during that questioning, including her statement, &quot;I shot him.&quot; Statements made at trial by defendant's witness were admissible since they were made in response to State's questions on cross-examination and were proper for impeachment purposes. The supreme court further held that the State produced sufficient evidence that defendant's version of what happened was materially contradicted by the physical evidence, and the jury was properly instructed as to the issue of self-defense. Defendant's sentence was not extreme since it was within the statutory limit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged a judgment of the Hinds County Circuit Court, Mississippi, granting the State's motion to dismiss appellant's complaint which had alleged violations of his federal constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time appellant filed his civil action, he was incarcerated in the state penitentiary. Appellant's complaint only made general allegations and identified no specific persons acting under the color of state law who were responsible for any of the wrongs he alleged had been done. Appellant sought millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages, as well as 500 acres of land and a family home at the government's expense. He argued the trial court erred in dismissing his complaint without giving him the opportunity to present evidence to support his claims. The judgment was affirmed on appeal. Appellant filed his complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. One of the essential elements of a &sect; 1983 claim was that the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under the color of state law. Appellant's complaint did not name any persons who acted under the color of state law. The State was not a &quot;person&quot; that Congress intended to subject to liability, and therefore, could not be sued under &sect; 1983 in state court. As a result, the State's Miss. R. Civ. P. 12(b) motion was properly granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court properly granted the State's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under which relief could be granted. Appellant's civil rights complaint failed because it did not name any persons who acted under the color of state law. The State, itself, was not considered a &quot;person&quot; under the applicable civil rights statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendant's nephew and a tow truck operator notified police of the location of a store-owner shooting-victim's stolen truck, which implicated defendant in the murder and theft. At trial, both the victim's grandson, who had not been present at the crime, and defendant himself, identified defendant from a surveillance video from the time of the crime. Defendant was convicted and sentenced. The appellate court held that the jury, at sentencing, could consider any matter brought up during the guilt phase. The State's error in instructing the prospective jury of the law during voir dire was harmless as the verdict was not attributable to the misstatements. Counsel's failure to object to the grandson's testimony did not constitute ineffective assistance in that defendant did not show prejudice, as the evidence against defendant was overwhelming. The prosecutor's misconduct in instructing the jury to ignore defendant's constitutional rights by referring to how the victim's rights had not been protected was harmless, in that evidence of defendant's callousness was overwhelming. Defendant did not deserve a manslaughter instruction because he offered no evidence to support one.</SPAN></P>

The children's mother was divorced from the father and the father gained sole custody of the children. The mother was subsequently incarcerated and her visitation rights were considerably restricted. Following trial, the chancellor awarded appellees visitation and denied appellant's request for attorney fees under the statute. On appeal, appellant contended that the chancellor misinterpreted the statute, and challenged the statute's constitutionality. The supreme court affirmed, holding that the chancellor correctly applied Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-16-3(1) (1994), which applied when one parent, such as the mother, was awarded no custody. Second, the statute was not unconstitutional, because it was narrowly interpreted to protect appellant's right to determine his children's care. Third, the visitation awarded was not excessive. Finally, the chancellor was within his discretion in determining that the proceedings imposed no financial hardship on appellant, thereby denying appellant his request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed a bill payment center, killed a teller, and stole cash. People saw the crime and saw defendant run from the scene. Defendant alleged sentencing instructions to consider the killing's occurrence during a robbery and to avoid arrest as aggravating factors impermissibly &quot;double counted&quot; the underlying crime in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. As defendant received life, he was not prejudiced, so those issues were not considered. Defendant's proposed instruction that a law enforcement officer's testimony should not be given greater weight impermissibly commented on evidence and duplicated the instruction the jury was the sole judge of each witness. Admission of evidence of defendant's flight out of town required that the flight was unexplained and had considerable probative value. Defendant asserted his flight was explained, as he regularly took the bus to Chicago. Under the circumstances, his flight was unexplained. A circumstantial evidence instruction was not required, as direct evidence of defendant's guilt was presented. Inconsistencies in testimony identifying defendant did not make the case a circumstantial evidence case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Jackson County Circuit Court, Mississippi, that convicted him on a jury verdict of capital murder and kidnapping, challenging jury instructions and evidentiary rulings, the jury qualification statute's constitutionality, the validity of the indictment, and other alleged errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial evidence showed that defendant and the co-defendant went to the murder victim's hotel room, that defendant fatally shot the victim and the co-defendant tied up the victim's friend and locked her in a box. Defendant helped the co-defendant dispose of the body, and they both removed the victim's and the friend's belongings from the hotel room. Defendant was charged with capital murder and kidnapping, was convicted by a jury, and appealed. The appellate court affirmed: (1) use of an erroneous jury instruction was harmless error, as the other instructions cured its defects; (2) an instruction that did not require a finding as to which victim was robbed was proper; (3) the indictment was not defective; (4) judgments notwithstanding the verdicts were properly denied, as the evidence was sufficient to convict on both charges; (5) requiring jurors to be over 21, literate, and electors, was not unconstitutional; (6) defendant waived an objection to alleged prosecutorial misconduct; (7) no error occurred in admitting gruesome photos of the victim, or in excluding an irrelevant videotape; (8) the duress instructions were proper, as there was some evidence to support them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. However, because of continuing confusion with improper instructions concerning aiding and abetting, the appellate court adopted the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals pattern jury instruction on aiding and abetting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, at gunpoint, ordered two men to leave a bar. One of the men was shot and killed when the gun went off. The trial court permitted the surviving man to testify defendant had pointed the gun at him first before pointing it at the victim. Defendant argued this was a prejudicial admission of another crime. He further alleged that he was denied a speedy trial, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and that his prior felony burglary convictions did not support his habitual offender status as he did not serve a year under either conviction. The appellate court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony that defendant had threatened another man with a gun before shooting the victim. Further, defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated because of continuances granted, defendant failed to prove that his attorney's performance was defective, and defendant's two prior felony burglary convictions supported his habitual offender status.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon remand for resentencing, the Harrison County Circuit Court (Mississippi) sentenced defendant to die for a 1976 kidnapping and murder. Defendant sought review in his case for the 10th time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant called a bank to speak to its officer and found his home. Defendant pretended to be utility man, got in, seized the officer's wife, left her three year-old, drove her to a remote place, killed her, then told the officer for two days that she was alive and well. Defendant confessed, fully cooperated, and was sentenced. On a remand, defendant agreed with the State to forego another sentencing trial and accept life without parole. Later that sentence was ruled illegal and he was resentenced. The supreme court held that it had authorized the State to seek death upon resentencing, and that was in the jury's hands; thus there was no prosecutorial vindictiveness. &quot;Heinous&quot; aggravator was found in victim's abduction away from three year-old, not just her murder. There was no impermissible &quot;doubling&quot; of the heinous and kidnapping aggravators. As defendant requested a court-appointed psychiatric examination and evidenced the report, the State, in rebuttal, could do so too without disclosing its substantive contents. The district attorney retained control over its special prosecutor. Double jeopardy was not violated. Death could be imposed for killing regardless of intent.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in striking the potential jurors who expressed reservations about imposition of the death penalty, or in denying defendant the funds to procure an expert pathologist since defendant showed no substantial need for his own expert.

The Chickasaw County Circuit Court, Mississippi, denied PERS's motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and improper venue. PERS sought interlocutory review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The justice sought, unsuccessfully, to obtain a ruling from PERS as to whether his reimbursements for meals, travel, lodging, and utilities were considered earned compensation on which he was entitled to retirement benefits. He sued PERS, seeking a declaratory judgment. PERS's motion for summary judgment on grounds that the justice failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and that venue was improper, was denied. PERS petitioned for interlocutory review. The instant court found it proper to rule on the dispositive legal issue as well as the grounds raised in the appeal, and affirmed. Venue was proper, as the justice filed the case in the county where his retirement checks would be sent. The justice was relieved of exhausting administrative remedies, because: (1) the dispositive question was one of law; (2) agency's expertise was not required; (3) judicial economy would be served; and (4) PERS's sluggish response to the justice's case deprived him of an adequate administrative remedy. The instant court held that the justice's expense reimbursements were earned compensation for retirement purposes under &sect; 25-11-103(k).</SPAN></P>

Appellants alleged the State failed to meet its burden of proof, believing that the evidence considered was insufficient to support the ultimate finding. Additionally, appellants asserted that all evidence relating to the mother's statements to a social worker was based upon hearsay. The appeals court affirmed the findings. Because no hearsay objection was made when the statements were proffered, the argument was barred. Expert medical opinion was that the victim suffered trauma to her anus and rectum. The trier of fact chose to believe testimony from the medical professionals and the social worker over the parents. Such was the charge of the fact finder. Clearly, sufficient evidence was present to support the trial court's finding. Second, appellant's failure to raise a constitutionality issue at trial or to notify the Attorney General's office of their challenge of the statute, resulted in the procedural bar. Appellants failed to make any showing that any of their fundamental constitutional rights were violated, thus the issue was meritless.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 4, &sect; 59. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Mississippi Senate was considering conference committee reports when plaintiff senator rose on a point of order and asked that whatever was going to be passed into law be read in full. The request was made pursuant to Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 59 (1890). Defendant lieutenant governor ruled that plaintiff senator was not entitled to have a house bill read because the matter before the senate was not a bill, but was a conference report, not subject to the requirements of Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 59 (1890). Plaintiffs did not suggest that they or other senators were uninformed as to the text of either the bill or the conference report or that they had not been distributed; or did they argue that there was confusion or misunderstanding of those texts or their import. The complaint merely asserted the violation of Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 59 as a violation of the plaintiffs' right and that they had no other remedies at law. Such a statement was not a clear and specific statement of irreparable injury. In her temporary restraining order, the chancellor erred by abandoning normal judicial processes, failing to abide by Miss. R. Civ. P. 4.</SPAN></P>

At the end of that period, appellant was notified its sign was non-conforming. Appellant sought review by the Sign Appeals Board, which affirmed the original decision, and appellant sought review in the Madison County Circuit Court (Mississippi), which also affirmed. Appellant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After public hearings, appellee adopted a sign ordinance with an amortization period within which appellant had to bring its sign into compliance. At the end of this period, appellant was notified its sign was not in compliance, and would have to be removed or brought into compliance. Appellant alleged this was an unconstitutional taking of its property under Miss. Const. art. III, &sect; 17. There was a distinction between zoning regulations, which merely restricted the use and enjoyment of property through a lawful exercise of the police power, and the taking of property for public use. The former did not entitle a property owner to compensation, while the latter did. The right to continue a nonconforming use was not a perpetual easement to make a use of one's property detrimental to his neighbors and forbidden to them. Incidental injury would not prevent the operation of the police power, once it was shown to be exercised for proper purposes of public health, safety, morals, and general welfare, and there was no arbitrary or unreasonable application in the particular case. The right to continue a nonconforming use could be lost even where significant value remained in the prior use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was affirmed because appellee engaged in a valid exercise of its police power, in adopting the sign ordinance and providing an amortization period. The ordinance was not a taking under the Mississippi Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order of the Lee County Circuit Court (Mississippi) that required him to serve out the remainder of his original prison sentence, after the Mississippi Department of Correction (MDOC) decided to remove him from the Intensive Supervision Program (ISP).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant pled guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to sell, the trial court sentenced him to 20 years in the custody of the MDOC and placed him in the ISP program. When an MDOC field officer removed appellant from ISP for violating a condition of supervision, appellant sought review from the trial court. It refused to consider his constitutional challenges to the ISP law, and ordered him to serve the rest of his sentence in prison. Appellant sought review. The appellate court reversed the order of imprisonment. While the trial court had reserved the right to review appellant's sentence for one year, the ISP statute had later been amended to vest sole jurisdiction in the MDOC regarding ISP violations. Appellant had to exhaust all administrative remedies before petitioning the trial court for review, and the record did not show that he did so. Thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter its order, but the appellate court also refused to consider his constitutional challenge to the ISP law, because it could not do so until there was a proper record of the administrative proceedings. The case was remanded so appellant could pursue his administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgement removing appellant from ISP and sending him to prison reversed. Under amended statute, MDOC had initial jurisdiction over ISP issues, and the trial court lacked jurisdiction in this matter until appellant had exhausted his administrative remedies with the MDOC. Order declining to consider appellant's constitutional objections to the ISP law was affirmed, as such review was impossible without a record of the administrative proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the appellate court was whether appellee Hancock County Board of Supervisors properly suspended contract negotiations between appellant waste corporation and the regional waste authority. Numerous citizens opposed the location of a privately owned waste facility in county and presented to the board a petition for a special election under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 19-3-55 (Supp. 2000). The board declined to take unilateral action on the issue, but called for the county-wide special election. Appellant challenged the board's authority to call such an election. Appellant argued the statute was unconstitutional. Appellee was dealing with a petition to determine if its citizens approved of a private company owning their landfill. The restriction sought was not to the use of land, but rather what entity should be vested with the authority to manage the county's waste. Absent a liberty interest, appellant had no basis for asserting a U.S. Const. amend. XIV violation. The board's acts were lawful and authorized by &sect; 19-3-55. Nothing in the record supported the allegation that the board's acts were arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Pike County Chancery Court (Mississippi) finding that the wrongful death beneficiary of a three-year-old boy was the estate of his deceased mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The boy's mother and natural father had an affair lasting four months while the two were college students. When she became pregnant and told the father the child was his, he disagreed, but told her that he would take a blood test and discuss the situation afterwards. The father did not know when his son was born because he had not communicated with the boy's mother. The father never met his son and provided no support for his son's birth or medical expenses, food, or clothing. When the boy and his mother were killed in an car accident, the father paid nothing toward his son's funeral bill. He had received confirmation only four days before his son's death that he was the natural father. Judgment denying wrongful death benefits to deceased boy's half-brother, appellant, who was fathered by father, was affirmed. The uncontradicted proof failed to support the claim that appellant half-brother was an heir-at-law of the deceased boy through their common father. The father was not allowed to receive a windfall when he refused to openly treat his deceased son as his own or to comply with his duty to provide essential support, until it appeared he might receive a sizable inheritance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed; deceased's boy's natural father never openly treated his son as his own child and never provided support for the boy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant proponent presented her third anti-gambling initiative for inclusion on the Mississippi ballots. Plaintiff citizens challenged the initiative as violative of unspecified state Bill of Rights provisions as well as Miss. Const., art. 15, &sect; 273(4), which required disclosure of any anticipated negative impact on government revenues. Defendant had simply attached a statement that no negative impact would occur. The court found this assertion unreasonable on its face, and voided the initiative. Defendant had also argued that since a statute specifically provided for initiative litigation to proceed in a single trial court, all others lacked jurisdiction. The court ruled that the statute simply designated venue for reasons of convenience, and that while courts would not judge the wisdom of initiatives, they would judge their compliance with constitutional rules. Finally, every Mississippi elector had standing to challenge the legality of initiatives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed declaratory judgment. All circuit and higher courts could review initiatives, despite legislative placement of venue in only one. Plaintiffs had standing as voters.

On appeal, appellants argued the trial court erred by requiring appellants to pay an additional $ 100,000 over the $ 925,533 already paid since the result would be tantamount to holding them jointly and severally liable to such an extent as to allow appellees to recover more that 50 percent of their recoverable damages under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 85-5-7(2) (1999). The court reversed the judgment, determining that appellants had satisfied the judgment against them because 50 percent of the total judgment had been paid to appellees. Implementing the statute, appellants and defendant driver were jointly and severally liable for up to 50 percent of the judgment. Therefore, the court concluded appellants were released from any further obligation to appellees pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 85-5-7 (1999).</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of violating Miss.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing appellant's request for a continuance when the State disclosed on the first day of trial a confession letter appellant had written to his daughter, which was given to the State that same day by appellant's ex-wife, because the trial court declined to rule on the letter until the next day, giving appellant an overnight chance to review it. Because there was no evidence showing that appellant assaulted his daughter but did not at the same time rape, fondle, and commit sexual battery on her, given the overwhelming proof, including the daughter's and eyewitnesses' testimony, the trial court did not err by refusing to give a simple assault instruction. The trial court did not err by sentencing appellant to life in prison because it was entitled to do so under the habitual offender statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because appellant was given the chance to review overnight a letter disclosed by the State on the first day of trial, no evidence showed that a jury instruction on simple assault was warranted given the overwhelming evidence against appellant, and appellant's life sentence as a habitual offender was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed an order in the Circuit Court of Hinds County (Mississippi), First Judicial District, which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant doctor, upon a finding that defendant was an employee of a state entity and that plaintiffs failed to file their action within the one-year statute of limitations provided by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-11 (Supp. 1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' minor child died after a medical procedure performed by defendant doctor at a state university medical center. The trial court limited discovery by plaintiffs as to defendant's employment status, and granted defendant's summary judgment motion after finding defendant was a state university employee, and that plaintiffs' action was time-barred. The court reversed and remanded for further discovery on the issue of defendant's employment status, with directions to the trial court to apply the Miller five-part test to determine defendant's status. Because there were questions of fact, specifically with regard to defendant's medical partnerships, coupled with plaintiffs' previous attempt to conduct discovery, the trial court's grant of summary judgment was premature. Further, there was a question of fact as to when the limitations period began to run. Although plaintiffs did not file a motion to compel in response to motions to quash discovery, they did file a response pleading and requested at the hearing on the motion to dismiss that the trial judge require compliance with the subpoenas; thus, plaintiffs were not dilatory in attempting discovery on the issue.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 47-5-138 was constitutional; the fact that it provided inmates no automatic right to file in forma pauperis appeals in suits which had been deemed to be frivolous did not render the statute unconstitutional, given that no such right existed for non-frivolous lawsuits. The statute was also not unconstitutional because it failed to grant inmates a right to counsel in appealing a revocation of good time credits under the statute, given that paid assistance of counsel in non-capital post-conviction appeals was not required. Appellant was not denied due process because the court had previously affirmed the dismissal as frivolous of appellant's habeas corpus motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for selling crack cocaine, based upon testimony of narcotics special agents and a confidential informant. The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding that the &quot;self-help&quot; provision of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139(f) was void for vagueness, but the provision of the statute creating the offense was severable and, because defendant could not have availed himself of the &quot;self-help&quot; under any imaginable set of guidelines, his conviction and sentence would not be disturbed. The indictment included five acts which constituted a common scheme to deal in a controlled substance, and the State was not attempting to secure convictions on each of the five transfers, thus Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; County Ct. Prac. 7.07 was not violated. A narcotic's agent's explanation of a street phrase was admissible due to its unusual meaning particular to the drug trade.</SPAN></P>

Consequently, substitute counsel was appointed, and the appeal perfected. The judgment was affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded; the jury's verdict was not so contrary to the overwhelming weight of evidence as to constitute an unconscionable injustice. The trial court erred by not making specific findings of fact on the merits of the proffered reasons for exercising peremptory strikes, however, this error was harmless. Appellant was entitled to have the trial court state explicitly on the record whether it considered alternative juvenile sentencing; therefore, the court vacated appellant's 45 year sentence and remanded for resentencing with consideration of alternative juvenile sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues on appeal concerned the denial of appellee's motion for sanctions against appellant and appellant's challenges to the constitutionality of the Mississippi state flag solely on the grounds of Mississippi's Constitution. The court determined that sanctions against appellant were inappropriate, as the issues raised had arguable merit. The court concluded that the state flag containing within it the Confederate battle flag could have been flown by the state without violation of the Mississippi or United States Constitutions, as neither the flying of the state flag, nor the flag itself, caused any constitutionally recognizable injury. The court also noted that the flag was Mississippi's flag by custom and usage only. Because 1894 legislation establishing the state flag was repealed in 1906, appellant's contention that the 1894 flag law was unconstitutionally vague was moot. Whether the flag in use continued as the state flag by use and custom was a political decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of her conviction for negligently causing death while driving under the influence of alcohol in Desoto County Circuit Court (Mississippi) which found Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-8 (1998) was constitutional, permitting appellant's blood to be drawn and tested for alcohol without probable cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was traveling on a highway when she lost control of her car and struck an on-coming vehicle, killing the driver. An officer ordered a medical technician to draw blood from appellant, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-8. However, there was no showing of probable cause. The statute authorized a mandatory blood alcohol test after a fatal car accident, regardless of the existence of probable cause. The court reversed appellant's conviction, first finding the statute unconstitutional and finding officer lacked probable cause or an exigent circumstance to order the blood drawn. It was not overwhelmingly burdensome for an officer to obtain probable cause. The statute was not preventative in nature. It was not necessary to circumvent constitutional requirement of probable cause. Blood drawn at by the technician was solely at the request of law enforcement who, at the time, did not have probable cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction reversed because the statute was unconstitutional insofar as it mandated the taking of a person's blood and testing it for alcohol without probable case. The state, upon retrial could use blood drawn by medical personnel for diagnostic purposes.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner's claims committee also ruled in favor of the surviving spouse, but the trial court deemed the statute unconstitutional pursuant to U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Miss. Const. art. 3 &sect; 16. On appeal, the state supreme court affirmed in part and vacated in part, reasoning the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the case because it impaired the decedent's right to designate his beneficiary without conferring a comparable right upon the decedent. The state supreme court determined however, insufficient evidence existed to hold the statute invalid in all situations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was charged with judicial misconduct. Petitioner adopted the recommendations of its committee that conducted a trial that judicial sanctions be imposed on respondent. Respondent alleged prosecutorial misconduct and equal protection violations. After reviewing the entire record, the court found that there were no specific acts that constituted bias and petitioner promptly corrected whatever bias might have existed. Additionally, no proof was presented that warranted a finding of abuse of prosecutorial discretion based on respondent's race or gender. The court found that while respondent clearly committed errors in judgment violating statutes and judicial canons, her actions did not constitute willful misconduct. However, respondent's abuse of her contempt powers violated Miss. Const. &sect; 177A. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that respondent's conduct, in its totality, constituted willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. She was fined and ordered publicly reprimanded.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff instituted an action against defendant for damages allegedly incurred as a result of the delay. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the contract was unambiguous and a matter for determination by the court rather than the jury. The trial court denied the motion on the grounds that the contract was ambiguous and therefore a matter of determination for the jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his capital rape conviction of his 12-year-old stepdaughter. The court affirmed. Testimony by appellee State's expert witness was proper because her testimony met the Frye test in that it would have been accepted within the medical community, and was admissible under Miss. R. Evid. 702 as scientific, technical, and specialized evidence that assisted the jury. Amending the indictment did not prejudice appellant because both the original and amended indictments were made well within the two-year limitation period. Prosecution was commenced by the initial indictment well within two years from the dates the crimes occurred. Use of the word &quot;rape&quot; in the indictment was not so vague that it denied appellant his due process. Evidence of appellant's prior sexual acts with the victim was admissible because it showed appellant's lascivious disposition toward his particular victim. Irrelevant testimony was properly excluded and there was ample evidence to convict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his post-conviction petition, the inmate challenged his armed robbery conviction. The armed robbery indictment stated the essential facts constituting the offense charged as required under Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; County Ct. Prac. R. 7.06 even though the inmate never took and carried away the property of another. Under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-79 (Rev. 2000), the inmate could be convicted of armed robbery while attempting to complete the crime. The inmate's guilty plea was entered knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily, because he was unaware that he did not complete one of the essential elements, in that he did not take and carry away the personal property of another. The inmate completed the essential elements, as the inmate could be convicted without taking and carrying away the property of another under &sect; 97-3-79. Counsel was not ineffective where counsel allegedly failed to inform the inmate that the inmate's failure to take and carry away the property of another meant that he did not satisfy the elements of the offense of armed robbery. There was no such requirement for a conviction under &sect; 97-3-79.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a pro se motion for post-conviction relief alleging that his convictions and sentences were unconstitutional and that he was entitled to relief on the basis of due process and equal protection. The Hinds County Circuit Court (Mississippi) dismissed the motion. His motion for leave to proceed before the highest appellate court was also denied. His second post-conviction motion was denied and dismissed. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motions the inmate sought post-conviction relief for a 1986 conviction and for two 1993 convictions. His first motion was filed in March 2001, and his second motion was filed in August 2001. The court dismissed the appeal from order denying the first post-conviction motion. First, the inmate never obtained permission from the highest state appellate court to file a post conviction relief motion with respect to the 1993 convictions; therefore, under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-7 (Supp. 2003) the court was without jurisdiction to address the allegations regarding those convictions. Regarding the 1986 conviction, the inmate's appeal from the denial of the motion was untimely under Miss. R. App. P. 4(a) because the appeal was filed 11 months after denial of the motion for post-conviction relief. Further, the court was without jurisdiction even if the appeal were from denial of the second motion because the filing of a second such motion was barred by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-23(6) (Supp. 2003).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal and taxed all costs to the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient suffered from acute heart disease, and underwent heart bypass surgery. Subsequently her legs were amputated, as a result of blood clots, which arose from a prescribed medication. She sued defendants, the primary doctor, and a hematologist, for medical malpractice. The Hinds County Circuit Court, Mississippi, granted summary judgment for the doctors on grounds of immunity as State employees. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue was whether the doctors were acting as employees of the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), or whether they were independent contractors, for purposes of immunity or liability. The operational purpose of UMMC was to serve the State, and also to provide care for persons on Medicaid. However, the doctors did wear two hats, as they were entitled to engage in separate private practice, to a degree. Applying the standard of Miller v. Meeks, the appellate court noted the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning, exercised reasonable control over the doctors, and the State had the power to terminate the doctors' contract. The fact the doctors exercised their professional judgment in treating patients, did not mean that they were independent contractors. One doctor testified he was serving a public function, and providing care for the subject patient, through Medicaid. The appellate court held the uncontroverted evidence was that the doctors were acting as employees of UMMC. Thus, pursuant to Mississippi's former sovereign immunity law, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-7(2) (Supp. 1991), the doctors were immune from liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Costs on appeal were assessed to the patient.</SPAN></P>

The issue in defendant's appeal was different from that presented to the trial court in defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal. Notwithstanding the procedural bar, there was no authority from defendant indicating that the Mississippi Supreme Court had held that the relevant language of the Mississippi Constitution afforded a higher level of insulation from searches and seizures than those afforded by the Fourth Amendment. Defendant's other two issues were relating to rulings on evidentiary matters and did not invoke constitutional considerations. The appellate court was limited to issues that involved constitutional questions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was considered for parole by the Mississippi State Parole Board (board) and denied release. The board's ruling stated that no further review of the inmate's eligibility would be undertaken for five years. The inmate filed a petition for writ of mandamus to compel the board to conduct annual reviews of eligibility for parole. The Sunflower County Circuit Court (Mississippi) denied the petition. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the inmate argued that the portion of the board's decision to hold no further review for five years violated the former Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-5(7) (Rev. 2000). The inmate argued that the former subsection required that every potentially eligible inmate receive reconsideration for parole on an annual basis. The board countered that the subsection required only a one-time action by the board. Additionally, the board noted that the subsection was removed in the amended statute. The appellate court rejected the inmate's arguments. The court found that the plain reading of the former section indicated that the Mississippi Legislature intended to mandate a one-time review in the year 2000 of all inmates then falling within the class of offenders defined in the subsection. Had the Legislature intended to institute an on-going requirement that, henceforth, all potentially-eligible inmates would receive at least an annual formal evaluation of eligibility, the court found that the Legislature would have said so in clear terms. Thus, the court declined to undertake the strained reading of this passage that would be required to obtain the inmate's meaning of the statute.</SPAN></P>

He pleaded guilty to the new charges and was sentenced to serve six years for the burglary and three years for the escape. He sought post-conviction relief, which the trial court denied. The court affirmed on appeal. While the inmate raised several issues on appeal, the court found them all time barred and procedurally barred according to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(2) (Supp. 2002) because the inmate filed his motion for post-conviction relief well beyond the three-year limitations period. There were no exceptions that extended this period, and the inmate's pro se status and ignorance of the law alone were insufficient to establish cause. Without waiving the procedural bar, the court addressed the inmate's claim that he received an unconstitutional sentence. The court found no error. The inmate was properly charged under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-9-45 (Rev. 2002) and entered a plea of guilty, and the sentence he received was well within the maximum prescribed by the statute.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found, according to the record, that the trial judge mistakenly determined the crime of molestation under Miss.

The appellate court held molestation was recognized as a separate offense from sexual battery as defendants were frequently charged with both crimes simultaneously. The appellate court concluded to allow defendant to be convicted of a crime for which he was never charged would have created an injustice as the legislature felt it necessary to construct two separate and distinct statutes regarding sexual battery and molestation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sued the State, alleging that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-3(1)(g) (Supp. 2002), an amendment to a parole statute, violated his right to equal protection of the law. The Leflore County Circuit Court (Mississippi) found that the inmate did not have standing to challenge the amendment and dismissed the complaint. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 47-7-3(1)(g) barred parole for nonviolent first offenders convicted between July 1, 1995 and January 1, 2000. The inmate maintained (though the record was silent on this issue) that he was convicted between June 30, 1995, and January 1, 2000; therefore, he was ineligible for parole even if he was a &quot;first offender.&quot; The appeals court held the case was not subject to dismissal due to the absence of any proof of service of process, since the State participated in the appeal, thereby waving proper service under Miss. R. Civ. P. 4(e). There was no evidence in the record as to the number of convictions or the sentences to which the inmate was subject. The trial court denied relief based on its factual finding that the inmate was not a &quot;first offender&quot; and therefore lacked standing to challenge Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 47-7-3(1)(g). It erred because it relied on extra-record information to make that finding. On remand, the State had to prove whether the inmate was a &quot;first offender&quot; under &sect; 47-7-3(1)(g) -- i.e., had two or more convictions under charges separately brought and arising out of separate incidents at different times. If so, dismissal for lack of standing would be proper.</SPAN></P>

He received a five year suspended sentence with two years of post-release supervision. A provision of the sentencing order permitted the inmate to transfer his supervision to either Tennessee or Georgia, if he was accepted by one of those states. The suspension was revoked after the inmate failed to report to his probation officer, left the state, and was twice arrested for driving under the influence. The suspension was revoked in its entirety. The inmate claimed that the felony driving under the influence conviction pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30(2)(c) (Rev. 1996) was improper, because both of the predicate convictions occurred out-of-state. Out-of-state convictions, however, constituted predicate convictions pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30(7) (Rev. 1996). The inmate's suspension was properly revoked because he left the state, although the sentencing order permitted him to do so. The inmate had to first seek permission to transfer his supervision, and he failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that he was entitled to post-conviction relief under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-39-5(1)(c) (Rev. 2000) because of the McDuff ruling. The appellate court held that defendant's petition was properly denied. Neither the statute under which defendant was charged or convicted was declared unconstitutional, only a statute controlling an evidentiary matter, and defendant could have challenged the statute in the trial court or on direct appeal. The fact that defendant chose to plea guilty rather than challenging the trial court's evidentiary ruling did not entitle defendant to challenge the ruling outside the time limits on seeking post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Chickasaw County (Mississippi) modifying the conditions by which he could avoid spending the final 15 years of a 20 year sentence in confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of burglary of a dwelling. The judgment of sentence stated that defendant was to be banished from a city for the period of his suspended sentence. After a hearing on remand, the circuit court amended the original judgment to remove the provision for banishment and placed defendant on supervised probation for a period of five years upon his release from custody. On appeal, defendant contended that the added requirement of supervised probation was a new and additional element of punishment, more onerous than his original sentence, resulting in his being punished twice for the same crime in violation of the Double Jeopardy provisions of the United States Constitution. The appellate court concluded that the substitution of some period of formal probationary supervision in place of a like term of banishment did not constitute an increase in the degree or character of defendant's punishment that would invoke constitutional concerns of double jeopardy. Also, the supervised probation was essentially rehabilitative in its objectives and not punitive. Thus, the change in probation terms was within the circuit court's authority.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court rejected the law firm's argument. While not mandated by law to do so, all of the parties to the contract chose to voluntarily submit to the chancellor for approval the settlement of the claim, and the disbursement of funds paid in settlement of this claim. By voluntarily submitting this matter to the chancellor for approval, the parties did so for all purposes. Included within the chancellor's power to approve was of necessity included the power to disapprove. Having found that the chancellor had the power to disapprove of the parties' claim, the appellate court found that the chancellor's actions were supported by substantial credible evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State instituted an eminent domain proceeding to condemn appellant owners' property to build a new bridge. Following a trial, the Jackson County Special Court of Eminent Domain (Mississippi) returned a verdict stating that the State pay the owners $ 831,000 for the taking of their property and denied the owners' subsequent motion for additur or in the alternative a new trial. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the owners argued, inter alia, that the verdict was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the credible evidence or the result of bias, prejudice, or passion on the part of the jury. The owners also argued the trial court erred by refusing to grant the owners an additur or, in the alternative, a new trial. The appellate court rejected the owners' arguments. The State presented two experts who testified that the value of the owners' property was $ 940,936 and $ 831,100 respectively. The owners' expert testified that the property was worth $ 990,995. The jury relied most heavily on one of the State's experts. As the amount set by the jury was between those values offered by all three experts, the court could not find that bias, passion, or prejudice influenced the award. The court further held that, because the weight of evidence was not against the jury's verdict, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the owners' motion for additur or new trial.</SPAN></P>

Eventually, defendant pled guilty to the crime of statutory rape. While the plea agreement did not specifically state that there would be a loss of the right against self-incrimination, it was apparent that the equivalent was stated in the plea agreement. Thus, defendant's guilty plea was made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. Also, the appellate court found that defendant understood the charges and sentences available and he pled guilty with full knowledge. Thus, his guilty plea was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made. Additionally, defendant failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, because the first indictment was nolle prosequi before he pled guilty, defendant was not subject to double jeopardy. Further, the indictment sufficiently alleged the identity of the victim, chaste character was not required under the new statute, and the location of the crime was included. In addition, there was sufficient evidence to support a guilty finding. Finally, defendant's sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The trial court imposed 2 consecutive 25-year sentences and consecutive 10-year suspended sentences on each remaining charge. Thereafter, defendant filed a motion for post-conviction relief, which was summarily dismissed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his post-conviction relief motion, as his motion and affidavits raised questions as to whether his guilty pleas were involuntary, whether counsel was ineffective, and whether the sentence was unconstitutionally disproportionate to the crime. In his motion and the affidavit of his mother, defendant contended he entered the guilty plea because of his attorney's representation of a lesser sentence than what he actually received. The appellate court initially noted that if a defendant attached an affidavit of another person supporting his post-conviction relief motion, he could avoid summary dismissal if his motion alleged facts that required further inquiry in the expanded setting of an evidentiary hearing. The appellate court held defendant's motion was sufficient to raise a question as to whether his plea was actually voluntary and whether he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. The appellate court concluded the trial court should not have summarily dismissed the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and remanded to consider the merits of defendant's allegations of an involuntary plea and ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the trial court had not erred in ordering defendant's arrest and re-incarceration after defendant failed to appear for arraignment. There was no evidence supporting defendant's claim that the prosecutor was related to the victim. The sentence was within the statutory 20-year maximum, and the trial court was not required to sentence defendant to a lesser term on the theory that the sentence amounted to a life term. Defendant's claims of ineffective assistance were without merit.

When approached by an officer, defendant stated that the vehicle was out of gas. He was charged with driving under the influence. Defendant later contended that the driver left him in the vehicle when he went to purchase more gas. After defendant was convicted, he sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the trial court erred in defining the word &quot;operate.&quot; Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-30 required that the vehicle must have been capable of being moved by defendant, whether or not he was then in the act of causing it to move. Both defendant and the vehicle must have had a present ability to move. The instruction given could have led to a conviction, even if the jurors believed defendant's story that he was only behind the wheel after the car had run out of gas. However, the court found that the trial court was not required to give an instruction on circumstantial evidence, because direct evidence of the crime was offered. Finally, the court held that a prior driving under the influence conviction was self authenticating under Miss. R. Evid. 902, despite the fact that the seal was not recognizable on the copy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual battery on a child under the age of 14 and was sentenced to two concurrent five-year prison terms. Defendant argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney did not challenge an unconstitutional indictment or assert a valid statute of limitations defense. The appellate court found no error. Defendant's claim regarding the indictment was not that the indictment itself was unconstitutional, only that defendant had been charged under the wrong subsection of the statute. The court rejected that argument because the indictment properly charged defendant with the offense under the version of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-95 (1)(c) that was in effect at the time of the offense. The prosecution commenced by indictment 17 months after the date of the alleged offense and was within the two year limitation period provided in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-1-5 (Rev. 2000). The fact that the trial occurred more than two years after the offense affected only defendant's speedy trial rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual battery in the Lauderdale County Circuit Court (Mississippi). Defendant appealed, asserting that the trial court: (1) made comments prejudicial to his defense, (2) improperly excluded evidence of the alleged victim's character, (3) failed to require proper authentication of the alleged correspondence from defendant to the victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with having inserted his finger into the 15 year-old victim's vagina, and subsequently sending very explicit e-mails to the victim. Defendant argued that he was prejudiced by the trial judge's reference to a party who did not testify as &quot;a witness,&quot; and the references to the child as the &quot;victim&quot; in jury instructions. However, defendant failed to objected to any of these matters at trial and they were not preserved for appeal. Defendant made a number of assertions as to why his counsel was ineffective, including that his attorney failed to object to leaving a female on the jury who had previously rendered a guilty verdict in a rape case. However, the appellate court found nothing about defendant's claims that would have had the likely effect of changing the outcome of the case. The trial court properly excluded evidence of the victim's prior bad character, because it was not relevant to the charge of sexual battery under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-95(1)(c) (Rev. 2000). Finally, the e-mails were properly admitted because the trial judge found that the victim had vouched for their accuracy, and an officer testified that defendant admitted that he sent the e-mails.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine by the Circuit Court of Panola County, Mississippi.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Late one evening, defendant was sitting in a car parked on the edge of a cemetery. A narcotics officer pulled up beside defendant, exited his vehicle, and instructed defendant to show his hands. Defendant drove off. During a pursuit, the officer saw defendant throw a plastic bag and other objects out of the car window. Defendant eventually stopped his car. The officer searched the roadside and found three rocks of crack cocaine inside a plastic bag. On appeal, defendant argued the trial court improperly allowed the State to introduce his testimony from a prior revocation hearing. At the hearing defendant explained that he was parked at the cemetery to meet a woman in order to swap crack cocaine for sex. This contradicted his trial testimony in which he claimed he had no cocaine. The appeals court held defendant's prior assertion was a statement made by a party opponent and, thus, was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. His life sentence without parole was not grossly disproportionate to a habitual offender's crime of possession of a controlled substance. Defendant's case was not prejudiced by an amendment to the indictment, as the amendment affected the penalty only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband filed from divorce from appellee wife. The Lee County Chancery Court, Mississippi, issued an order regarding visitation that neither the husband nor his attorney signed, awarded the wife $ 1106 in court costs, and held the husband in contempt of court. The husband appealed each order and the appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the husband and the wife divorced, the husband was granted custody of two of their children, and the wife had visitation. The wife moved for a modification of the visitation rights as the husband was interfering with her visitation. The matter was hard by a former chancellor as all of the county's chancellors had been recused. The court entered a new visitation schedule, but neither the husband nor his attorney signed the order. The wife moved for a contempt order against the husband when he continued to interfere with her visitation rights. The chancellor held the husband in contempt and ordered that he pay the wife's attorney fees and costs. The appellate court held that the visitation order was valid even though it had not been signed by the husband or his attorney, as it was agreed to in open court. Further, as there was a constitutional basis for appointing the former chancellor to hear the case, his rulings were valid. The appellate court held that fees assessed against the husband were statutorily authorized and proper. Finally, the issuance of the contempt order was proper as the husband had refused to cooperate with his wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders of the chancery court, including the change in visitation, the imposition of costs against the husband, and holding the husband in contempt, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the trial court erred in failing to sustain his motion for a directed verdict and or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the jury's verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. The instant court noted that defendant's first three issues were raised for the first time on appeal and were not properly preserved for appellate review. Regarding defendant's argument that the trial court erred in allowing a surgeon who treated the victim to testify as to the meaning of a legal term, &quot;serious bodily injury,&quot; thereby invading the province of the jury, the surgeon was properly allowed to offer an opinion as to whether the victim sustained a &quot;serious bodily injury.&quot; Defendant failed to demonstrate the likelihood of a different outcome had counsel performed in a different manner. This failure precluded a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. There was clearly substantial credible evidence upon which the jury could and did find that defendant assaulted the victim. There was no credible basis upon which the instant court could find the verdict of guilty to be contrary to the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that, because defendant made no claim of error on the part of the lower court, there was no decision to affirm or reverse. Defendant also claimed that reversible error occurred in the prosecutor's comments during closing argument. The appellate court held that the prosecutor's comments were harmless, and they did not create unjust prejudice against defendant so as to result in a decision influenced by prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a vehicular accident, defendant caused the death of a passenger in another vehicle. Officers investigating the accident testified that the debris from defendant's vehicle contained empty beer cans, packages of syringes, and bottles containing unidentified liquids and residue. Based on those discoveries, a blood sample was drawn and a urine sample taken from defendant that tested positive for the presence of cocaine and methamphetamines in defendant's system. The appellate court found that probable cause existed to draw fluid samples from defendant, thereby rendering admissible the results of the scientific testing of those samples. The appellate court was satisfied that the uncontroverted evidence that defendant had ingested illegal narcotics that were still present in measurable quantities in his body, together with evidence of remarkably unusual behavior and his demonstrably reckless operation of a motor vehicle were enough, when considered in conjunction, to support a reasonable inference by the jurors that defendant was, in fact, under the influence of the narcotic substances at the time of the fatal accident. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-147, the statute under which she was sentenced, was unconstitutional. Specifically, defendant contended the enhancement statute did not have a time limit for a prior conviction to enhance the penalty for a second offense, and due to this lack of time period restriction, her constitutional right to due process was violated. The trial court found that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the petition. On appeal, the appellate court concluded the trial court erred in dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction. In addition, the appellate court noted the issue of remoteness for a prior offense had not been addressed before as it related to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-147. However, the appellate court noted the supreme court had upheld the constitutionality of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 99-19-81, a similar habitual offender sentencing statute. The appellate court advised that it saw no reason to hold differently in a case dealing with Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-129-147.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by not appointing counsel for the probation revocation hearing. The appellate court found that probationers did not have a per se right to counsel at revocation hearings. The right to counsel did not attach because a probation revocation proceeding did not fall within the critical stages of a criminal prosecution where a substantial right of the accused might be affected. Defendant neither obtained nor requested counsel during any stage of his revocation proceeding. The defenses argued by defendant were straightforward and not complex or otherwise difficult to develop or present. The trial court was under no duty to appoint counsel during the revocation proceeding. There was no evidence in the record establishing that the trial court suspended defendant's sentence without attaching conditions of probation; therefore, the appellate court could not reverse the trial court's denial of post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck the victim's vehicle from the rear. Both were injured, and the victim later died at the hospital. As part of the diagnostic treatment administered to defendant, the hospital performed a urine analysis, which tested positive for cocaine. Defendant was charged and convicted of negligently causing the victim's death. The court affirmed on appeal and denied defendant's rehearing motion. Without the results of the urine analysis, the State would not have been able to prove that defendant was under the influence of cocaine when he collided with the victim's vehicle. Thus, the medical records regarding the analysis had to be removed from the protection of the physician-patient privilege found in Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 13-1-21(1) (Supp. 2001) and Miss. R. Evid. 503(b). The trial court did not err in refusing to exclude the results of the urine analysis done by the hospital employee simply because she did not hold a valid permit from the state crime laboratory pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 63-11-19 (Supp. 2001). The analysis performed was reasonable, and the results were admissible.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Grenada County Circuit Court, Mississippi, convicted defendant for possession of a controlled substance, more than one kilogram but less than five kilograms of marijuana, in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-139(c)(2)(F) (Rev. 2001). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying all peremptory motions and the verdict was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Defendant contended the State failed to prove constructive possession of the marijuana and therefore defendant could not be convicted of the possession charge. The appellate court found that testimony at trial linked defendant and only defendant to the marijuana. The narcotics agent specifically testified that the agents did not find anything in the vehicle or the bag that would link any other suspect to the crime. Defendant admitted that the bag belonged to him and he was listed as the renter of the vehicle. There was abundant evidence presented during trial as to defendant's guilt. The trial judge exercised his discretion and chose to sentence defendant to a term less than the maximum allowed by statute. His sentence was not disproportionate to the crime or excessive in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on two counts of sexual battery. He pled guilty to one count and the remaining count was retired. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison; however, the entire sentence was suspended. Thereafter, he was arrested on three counts of uttering a forgery. The State sought to revoke his probation. The trial court, following a hearing, revoked it and ordered him to serve the remainder of his 20-year sentence. Defendant's posttrial motion was denied without an evidentiary hearing. After the judgment of denial was entered, the appellate court found he was not entitled to relief based on his argument that the prior sentence was invalid given that he was not entitled to receive probation on his sexual battery conviction. It reasoned that he could not take advantage of his impermissibly lenient sentence to obtain postconviction relief after the lenient sentence was forfeited due to his own conduct. It also found: (1) that he was not denied effective assistance of counsel, (2) that he was not entitled to counsel at his revocation hearing and the State proved revocation was proper, and (3) that any error due to an incomplete record was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the officer argued that he was denied his right to procedural due process. The officer violated civil service rules preventing the use of unnecessary force and brutality to persons under arrest. The officer kicked the victim in the ribs, and the victim later reported to the hospital where he was found to have broken ribs and a collapsed lung. That type of behavior was exactly the type that caused harm to private citizens and was detrimental to city government in that it lessened the trust of the public in those sworn to protect them. Bowie was given proper notice regarding the pre-termination notice. The letter met all the requirements set out in the statute, and was very specific in laying out the grounds for Bowie's termination. The actions taken by the Commission were for good cause. There was substantial evidence that supported the Commission's decision to terminate the officer, and the basis provided in the Commission's findings of fact proved that the decision was not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

The county court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The property owner appealed to the Circuit Court of Harrison County (Mississippi) which affirmed and ruled that the property owner's notice of appeal was untimely and thereby statutorily barred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner never brought his account current by paying the complete balance, citing that he did not owe the charges. Therefore, the district refused to connect his business to the water and sewer lines until his account balance was settled. The property owner claimed that his appeal to the circuit court was filed in a timely manner because he filed it within the 30 days required by Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; County Ct. Prac. R. 5.04 and contended that the rule superseded Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-51-79 (1972), which gave a complainant 10 days from the county court judgment to file a proper notice of appeal. The court of appeals agreed that the rule superceded the statute. However the appellate court held that the property owner had not conquered the issue of summary judgment. The legal issue of whether a property owner could be compelled to pay the fees in question had already been settled by a decision of the supreme court in another case. That decision left nothing for the property owner to argue and no remaining facts in dispute that were material to the case.</SPAN></P>

Finding the clerk was protected by absolute quasi-judicial immunity, the trial court granted his motion to dismiss with prejudice. They appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court, pro se. The crucial question before the Supreme Court on appeal was whether the circuit judge abused his discretion in dismissing their case with prejudice.

Defendant applied the brakes, but the car continued through the intersection and struck another car, killing one person. Defendant signed consent forms to allow blood to be drawn; his blood alcohol level was found to be .11 percent ethyl alcohol. Defendant objected at trial that two lay witnesses were improperly allowed to opine that he was drunk at the time of the accident, that the trial court allowed improper redirect testimony, and the trial court erred in allowing the State's reconstruction expert to give his opinion that defendant was driving negligently. After defendant was convicted, the appellate court found the lay witness testimony was properly admitted, that defendant opened the door to the redirect testimony, that the error in admitting the reconstruction expert's opinion on negligence was harmless and that evidence of a witness's use of marijuana was properly admitted. It also found a cumulative instruction was properly denied, that no misconduct was revealed by marked jury forms, that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict, and defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally harsh.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Rankin County Circuit Court, Mississippi, convicted defendant of possession of more than 30 grams of cocaine and sentenced her to 30 years. Subsequently, the trial court denied defendant's motion for new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer had probable cause to pull the accomplice driver over, the accomplice consented to the search of the car, and defendant had no expectation of privacy as a passenger in the car that the accomplice was driving, as it was neither in her name, nor was there any evidence that she was a person responsible for the car. Therefore, defendant had no standing to challenge the search of the car or the seizure of the drugs, even if the contents were found to be her personal property. The trial judge was correct in preventing the jury from hearing the proffered evidence of the purse and its contents because of untimeliness of the defense in seeking to introduce it as evidence. Also, the jury verdict was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence as accomplice's testimony, which was adopted by the jury as true, showed that defendant was not only aware of the presence of the cocaine in the vehicle, but that she was intentionally and consciously in possession of it. Finally, the appellate court determined that the 30-year sentence was not grossly disproportional to the crime of possessing and attempting to transfer 716 pounds of cocaine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a jury's verdict of guilty of simple assault on a police officer and the sentence of the Madison County Circuit Court (Mississippi) of five years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer responded to a call of an alleged fight. The testimony at trial established that (1) police officers attempted to arrest defendant; (2) defendant walked away from the officers; (3) defendant struggled with one of the officers. On appeal, the appellate court only addressed those two issues which were pertinent to the appellate court's resolution of the case, namely (1) that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a lesser-included offense instruction and (2) that the trial judge erred in refusing to recuse himself from the case. There was a sufficient evidentiary basis in the record to support an instruction on resisting arrest. Had that instruction been given, it was quite possible that a jury might have found defendant guilty of resisting arrest rather than simple assault on a police officer. Moreover, the trial judge should have recused himself. He did not recuse himself, but instead accepted defendant's waiver of objection. Although the waiver was effective, the better reasoned approach would have been to recuse and avoid even the appearance of conflict.</SPAN></P>

Appellee father petitioned the court for a declaration of custody when appellant mother expressed her intent to move.

The appellate court held that the chancellor properly decided the case as one for initial custody since there had been no prior custody determination. The appellate court found that in addition to appellant mother's bisexual lifestyle, the chancellor was disturbed at her lack of financial and emotional stability. He was concerned that appellant mother quit a well-paying full time job to move and to start a business and was impressed with the appellee father's ability to provide a stable environment for his daughter in the form of an established home. Therefore, the appellate court held that although the morality of the mother's lifestyle was one important factor to the chancellor's decision, it was not the sole factor; thus, there was no clear error and the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in awarding custody to the father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant in a pickup pulling a trailer with 3 horses went through an intersection stop sign at 30 miles per hour. In the intersection appellant hit a vehicle with three occupants that had the right of way, killing its passengers. Appellant's blood sample showed an illegal alcohol level, and the remaining portion of it was destroyed by the State before he was indicted. None of the other vehicle's driver's blood sample, negative for alcohol, was destroyed. Appellant was convicted of DUI manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years in prison, 5 years suspended, with probation and restitution. The court affirmed. Photos introduced were admissible and not too gruesome. The trial court erred in admitting a diagram as to point of impact made by an officer who was not an accident reconstructionist. Also, the expert who testified should have made a personal determination about point of impact. However that was not reversible error because of the plethora of other evidence. There had been probable cause to draw blood. Appellant did not show that independent blood analysis would have differed in result. Failure to give a proximate cause jury instruction was error, but not reversible error.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he raised issue concerning evidence introduced at trial, the denial of several post-conviction motions, and the award of restitution to the wife of the victim. The appeals court affirmed the conviction, reasoning the administration of the blood test was valid, notwithstanding the invalidity of the statute, as the surrounding circumstances of the accident were adequate to establish probable cause. Further, although the blood test was administered more than two hours after the accident, there was no evidence of deliberate delay. Admission of testimony from the attending officers was not error as they merely talked shop to each other, despite an order of sequestration. Lastly, evidence of guilt was sufficient to warrant denial of appellant's post-conviction motions, and due to failure to object, restitution argument was not properly preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two minor children were injured in a car-truck accident in 1991. A truck driven by an employee of respondent trucking company collided with the van that carried the children. The mother of the two children reached a settlement with respondent in 1992. In both children's petition for settlement, their mother named petitioner as the father. She alleged that she and petitioner had never married, that he did not live with them, and that he did not provide monetary support for either child. Six years later, petitioner sought to set aside both settlement orders. Petitioner argued the 1992 orders were void because he was not joined as a party. Because no proof of petitioner's paternity was presented, the trial court dismissed his petition. Judgment was affirmed. At the time of settlement in 1992, there was no legally recognized father. The court found that petitioner did not need to be given notice or be joined in the settlement proceedings since the children were born out of wedlock, no one had ever been adjudicated the father, and petitioner himself did not live with or support the children. The judgment on the settlements was not void.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the conviction and sentence, arguing the jury should have been instructed on entrapment, and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held appellant was not entitled to an entrapment instruction. To raise the defense of entrapment, appellant was required to show evidence of government inducement to commit the criminal act and a lack of predisposition to engage in the criminal act prior to contact with government agents. Appellant instigated the sale, and was in possession of the cocaine at the time of the sale. The court held appellant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel. Appellant's counsel initially stated he was unprepared. However, counsel stated he could prepare if the trial were postponed until later that day. Counsel demonstrated readiness through thorough cross-examination and closing arguments. The court held the sentence imposed was within statutory limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence, because appellant was not entitled to an entrapment jury instruction, appellant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel, and the sentence imposed was within the limits prescribed by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother gave birth to her son in appellee's hospital. Appellant filed a complaint alleging that appellee's negligence during the birth resulted in the child suffering birth defects and other complications. Appellee argued that the claim was barred by the notice provision of the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, and that it was immune from liability pursuant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The trial court agreed with appellee that appellant's claim was barred by the Tort Claims Act and/or the doctrine of sovereign immunity, and dismissed the complaint. The court affirmed. The trial judge did not err in granting summary judgment in appellee's favor. The court assumed, in light of appellant's contention that her cause of action accrued prior to the effective date of the Tort Claims Act, that appellant learned of the alleged defects at or about the time of the birth of her child. The court found that appellant's cause of action accrued prior to the enactment of the Tort Claims Act. Therefore, the court followed Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-46-6, and applied common law. As a result, the doctrine of sovereign immunity protected appellee from the suit brought by appellant.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's cause of action accrued prior to the enactment of the Tort Claims Act, therefore the court was directed by statute to apply common law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Rankin County Circuit Court (Mississippi) which convicted him of voyeurism and sentenced as an habitual offender to life imprisonment without parole.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was seen peeping into the window of a home. Police arrived and saw appellant attempting to hide in the shadows. He ran but was apprehended. The trial court convicted him of voyeurism and sentenced him to life in prison without parole, as an habitual offender. The appellate court affirmed. The jury's verdict was not against the weight of the evidence as it was supported by overwhelming evidence. The lewd, licentious and indecent purpose and/or intent of the crime of voyeurism was easily inferred by the jury. Further, appellant failed to demonstrate that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Based on the weakness of appellant's case and the strength of the State's case, appellant could not prove that the outcome would have been different, but for the actions of his counsel. Finally, although the issue regarding the constitutionality of appellant's sentence was waived for failure to raise the issue at the trial level, the appellate court found that the sentence was not disproportionate to his crime. He was an habitual offender with serious prior convictions. The strict sentence was justified and within the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the jury verdict was supported by the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Further, the strength of the evidence against appellant was such that he was unable to show that but for his attorney's errors, a different result would have been achieved. Finally, appellant failed to raise the unconstitutionality of his sentence at the trial level. Thus, the issue was waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment, based upon a jury verdict, of the Hancock County Circuit Court (Mississippi), convicting him on two counts of burglary and sentencing him to seven years' in prison on each count to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, while still a municipal police officer, was apprehended during a &quot;sting operation&quot; burglarizing a tax assessor's office. Appellant ultimately gave a tape-recorded statement in which he admitted committing two burglaries. On appeal, following his convictions, appellant argued the trial court erred by admitting an officer's testimony about his out-of-court opinion that appellant was &quot;a dirty cop.&quot; The court found that statement was properly admitted as it was made in the context of the officer's thought process during the investigation to explain to the city's mayor why he acted and proceeded in the manner that he did. Further, the trial court did not improperly single out appellant for a sentence enhancement because he was a police officer. Appellant's sentence was not grossly disproportionate to others in similar situations. Finally, appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel, as he failed to show a reasonable probability of a different outcome had his trial counsel acted differently.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; officer's testimony as to statements he made to mayor that appellant was a &quot;dirty cop&quot; was admitted not for truth of matter asserted, but to show why &quot;sting operation&quot; was organized. Appellant's sentence was not grossly disproportionate to others similarly situated. Appellant could not have proved ineffective assistance of counsel, as witness testimony still strongly supported verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant sought review of his conviction for public profanity and resisting arrest by the Chickasaw County Circuit Court, Mississippi. The appellant challenged his conviction on the ground that his utterance, directed at a police officer, was not profane and that the profanity statute was unconstitutionally applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellant was arrested and charged with public profanity and resisting arrest after he allegedly addressed a police officer with profane language. The appellant was charged under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-29-47, which prohibited public profanity, defined as swearing or cursing profanely, or use of vulgar and indecent language. The appellant did not challenge the constitutionality of the statute, but claimed that the statute had been unconstitutionally applied to his speech. The appellant claimed his speech was political in nature and in response to profanity used by the arresting officer. The court reversed the appellant's conviction. The court held that the appellant's speech could not be proscribed as profane unless it rose to the level of &quot;fighting words&quot;, a type of speech unprotected by the First Amendment. As the appellant's speech could not be so classified, the court dismissed the charges, including the charge of resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellant's conviction. The court determined that in order to find the appellant guilty under the profanity statute, the appellant's speech would have had to be classified as &quot;fighting words.&quot; The court found the appellant's speech did not rise to such a standard and dismissed the charge; the resisting arrest charge was also dismissed.</SPAN></P>
