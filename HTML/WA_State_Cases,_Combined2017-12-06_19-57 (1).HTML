<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of orders from the King County Superior Court (Washington), which, in three separate trials, convicted him of assault in the first degree with sexual motivation, attempted indecent liberties, three counts of unlawful imprisonment with sexual motivation, rape, and murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In three separate trials, defendant was convicted of numerous charges stemming from a series of violent crimes. On appeal, the court found that the trial court did not violate his Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 right to conflict-free counsel when it refused to appoint an attorney to replace his counsel. Communication between defendant and counsel collapsed early in their relationship. It was plain from the record that the breakdown was entirely one-sided. Counsel never stopped trying to communicate with defendant, even though his efforts were met with verbal abuse and threats. The conflict and communication breakdown could not have been reasonably expected to resolve with substitution of counsel. Defendant's right to self-representation was not violated because he made self-representation infeasible by demonstrating that he could not, or would not, control his behavior in the courtroom. The trial court did not violate defendant's right to due process by ordering that he be held in restraints during all three trials. He had engaged in numerous episodes of assaultive or threatening behavior in the jail. He also repeatedly threatened to kill his attorney and the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county court clerk sought review of a judgment from the King County Superior Court (Washington), which granted respondent tenants' motion to redact the record of an unlawful detainer action following a settlement of that action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tenants sought an order requiring the substitution of their initials for their full names in the court's records, alleging that they had been denied rental housing based upon the record of the unlawful detainer action. The court found the redaction order improper because it conflicted with both the constitutional presumption of open courts in Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and the legislative policy determination in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.182.040(1)(b) allowing consumer reporting agencies to report lawsuits within seven years. Automatic limitations could not be placed on the openness of court proceedings; rather, a case-specific inquiry was required. Absent constitutional, statutory, or court rule protection for unlawful detainer defendants, such extraordinary relief as the tenants sought was inappropriate where that relief would thereafter be warranted for all similarly-situated litigants. The trial court overvalued the tenants' asserted interest when it found under Wash. Gen. R. 15(c)(2) that their interest outweighed the public's constitutional right of open access to court records. The settlement of the unlawful detainer action did not establish that it had been wrongfully filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The King County Superior Court, Washington, transmitted appellant juvenile's sexual behavior and risk assessment evaluation to the King County Sheriff. The juvenile appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile appealed the trial court's order denying his motion to bar release of the special sex offender disposition alternative (SSODA) evaluation to the King County Sheriff's Office. The appellate court noted that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.345(2) did not officially displace the sheriff as the designee of risk classifications, because the end-of-sentence review committee was now charged with making risk classifications in the future. It had always been charged with risk assessment. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.50.050 clearly encompassed the sheriff having the relevant information. The release of the evaluation under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.550(6) did not violate the juvenile's right to privacy under state or federal statutes or under the state or federal constitutions. The mandate by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.550(6) removed the privacy restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Pierce County Superior Court, Washington, convicted defendant of first degree murder. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court had to determine whether defendant abandoned his original personal restraint petition. The appellate court found that defendant timely filed a motion for relief from judgment and he was not responsible for the administrative error. Seeing the accomplice liability instruction through the lens of ineffective assistance did not transform it into a different claim; the claim remained one of instructional error. It was neither time-barred nor successive. The appellate court found that the erroneous instruction unconstitutionally relieved the State from the burden of proving defendant's knowing participation in &quot;the&quot; crime, meaning the charged crime. Defendant's trial attorney should have seen the inconsistency between the pattern instruction and the statute and counsel was deficient. There was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's failure to object to the defective instruction, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Defendant's claim of sufficiency of the evidence could not be heard because it included an untimely amended petition with a claim of prosecutorial misconduct that did not fit any exception to the one-year time limit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the Cowlitz County Superior Court (Washington), which denied his motion to suppress and convicted him of attempted possession of heroin.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police detective acquired the smartphone of a suspected drug dealer. While the phone was in the detective's possession, a text message from defendant appeared on its screen, asking the dealer to call him. Posing as the dealer, the detective replied to defendant's text message. The two men proceeded to exchange several text messages, eventually arranging a drug transaction, which led to defendant's conviction for attempted possession of heroin. On appeal, the court held that the detective did not violate Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 or the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. IV, when he used the dealer's phone to read and reply to the text messages defendant sent the dealer. Defendant's text messages to the dealer's phone were not private affairs. Defendant transmitted messages to a device over which he had no control. By doing so, defendant voluntarily ran the risk that his messages, once delivered, would be received by whomever possessed the phone, and he had no control over what that person might do with that message. The Fourth Amendment did not protect defendant's misplaced trust that the message actually would reach the intended recipient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order from the Cowlitz County Superior Court (Washington), which denied his motion to suppress and convicted him of attempted possession of heroin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police detective acquired the smartphone of a suspected drug dealer. The detective looked through the phone's contents and replied to a text message from defendant. Through a series of text messages from the dealer's phone, the detective and defendant agreed to meet for a drug transaction, which led to defendant's conviction for attempted possession of heroin. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the detective violated Washington's Privacy Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.73.030(1)(a), by intercepting his private text messages to the dealer. The court found that defendant impliedly consented to the recording and/or interception of the text messages that he sent to the dealer's phone. Cell phones, like computers, were &quot;message recording devices,&quot; a fact that defendant must have understood as a user of text messaging technology on cell phones. Because, as a user of text message technology, defendant would have had understood that the phone would record and store his text messages, sufficient evidence supported the conclusion that he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages in the dealer's phone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.060 and specifically the term &quot;clearly expressed&quot; was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous as applied because it was unclear from whose perspective--the victim or the defendant. The appellate court noted that the victim and defendant offered contradictory versions of what happened during the camping trip. The jury accepted one and rejected the other. The jury accepted the victim's version of events and rejected defendant's version. It was privileged to do just that. The statute was not ambiguous. And the court did not err by failing to instruct the jury that it had to determine whether the lack of consent was &quot;clearly expressed&quot; from the perspective of the person receiving the communication because that was not the standard and the term was unambiguous. There was ample evidence of a clearly expressed lack of consent by the victim. The jury found that the lack of consent was made known to defendant. The judge conveyed no attitude toward the merits of the case when he provided the jury with a simple informational instruction that certain exhibits would not be available for review during deliberations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner filed a personal restraint petition (PRP) challenging a decision from the King County Superior Court, Washington, which convicted him of unlawful issuance of checks or drafts and first degree theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial, bank records were admitted under the inevitable discovery rule, and the convictions were affirmed on review. Petitioner claimed that the rejection of that rule in State v. Winterstein, which was decided weeks after his appeal was final, applied retroactively to this case. He also contended that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. In dismissing, the appellate court held that Washington courts maintained congruence with the United States Supreme Court in analyzing retroactivity. Winterstein's inevitable discovery holding under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 announced a new rule for retroactivity purposes because the holding was not dictated by prior precedent. However, it did not meet the requirement for a watershed rule of criminal procedure. The exclusion of relevant evidence was not a rule without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction was seriously diminished. Moreover, Wash. R. App. P. 16.4(c)(4) did not establish an independent state retroactivity analysis. Therefore, Winterstein did not apply retroactively on collateral review to convictions that were final when it was decided. Finally, an ineffectiveness of counsel argument was time barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Okanogan County Superior Court, Washington, convicting him of first degree theft.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A burglary was committed at a railroad workshop. The workshop was within the boundaries of the Colville Reservation, but located on fee land owned by the railroad. Defendant was an enrolled member of the Colville Confederated Tribes, and his home was located on trust land within the Reservation. Defendant argued that the state courts lacked authority to issue a search warrant for his residence on the Reservation, and did not properly summons prospective jurors from the Reservation. The appellate court ruled that the state courts had authority to issue the search warrant and that defendant had not proven his challenge to the jury process. The workshop was on fee land rather than tribal or trust land, thus the state courts had jurisdiction over the crimes committed there. The U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that state officers could enter a reservation and serve a search warrant for a crime committed within the state's jurisdiction. Also, the record reflected that enrolled tribal members residing on trust lands were routinely called to jury service, and in the experience of the veteran trial judge, they regularly served on juries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant business owner challenged the judgment of the Walla Walla Superior Court, Washington, affirming an administrative order mainly deciding a sign he painted on his store violated size and height restrictions of the sign code enacted by respondent city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner operated a toy store and gift shop, and painted a wall sign depicting an octopus hiding behind a rainbow over the rear entrance of the store. The trial court found that the city's sign-and-height code restrictions did not violate the owner's free speech rights under the state and federal constitutions. The appellate court ruled that the city had satisfied its burden of showing the ordinances were lawfully justified. The city showed its restrictions were content neutral, reasonable, and supported by a legitimate regulatory interest. The size and height restrictions applied to all wall signs without classification and without reference to content, and the city carefully considered its sign size and height restrictions. The city provided a legislative history showing the wall sign size and height restrictions were adopted as part of a comprehensive plan to address aesthetics and traffic control. The ordinances did not reach constitutionally protected speech, as the ordinances regulated advertising by businesses to protect aesthetics and promote traffic safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The King County Superior Court, Washington, granted judgment in favor of respondent King County Department of Development and Environmental Services (DDES), by reversing the finding of the hearing examiner, who concluded that appellants, landowner and tenant, had established a valid nonconforming use and that the use did not occur within a critical area. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court agreed with the hearing examiner's finding that appellants established a nonconforming use under King County, Wash., Code 21A.06.800. The hearing examiner found that before September 2004, the tenant had rented the site, equipment was being assembled and stored, grading had occurred, materials for processing organic materials were being stockpiled, and access driveways had been extended. A materials processing facility was in existence on the landowner's property in April 2004 and it was a legal nonconforming use. DDES's interpretation of the zoning code read King County, Wash., Code 21A.24.230 out of the statutory scheme entirely, and the appellate court declined to adopt it. The hearing examiner's interpretation of the county code was correct. The hearing examiner granted appellants' appeal and set conditions necessary to preserve the effect of his ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the superior court was reversed; the hearing examiner's decision was reinstated and remanded to the hearing examiner for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed her conviction for second-degree extortion, arguing that the prosecuted conduct, which was demanding payment from a public servant in exchange for silence about the public servant's wrongdoing, was no different from accepting payment to settle and hold in confidence embarrassing facts underlying a threatened lawsuit. She insisted that U.S. Const. amend. I protected the party demanding payment in either case, but the appellate court disagreed and affirmed. A threat falling short of a true threat was protected from punishment as pure speech. But when the threat was a part of verbal and other conduct whose criminal punishment could be justified independent of the speech, the wrong, collectively, was not guaranteed protection from criminal punishment. Further, the evidence was undisputed that defendant's boyfriend threatened to disclose the correction officer's career-ending violations of the county's fraternization policy unless he was paid the $5,000 he demanded. On that evidence, defendant's conviction as an accessory did not punish speech protected by U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, class representatives, sought review of the decision of the Thurston Superior Court (Washington), which found in favor of respondent Department of Retirement Systems (DRS) and dismissed the claims against the DRS that it was required to pay class members daily interest on the full balance of employee contributions transferred between Plan 2 and Plan 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The class representatives were members of the Teachers Retirement System (TRS) and transferred from TRS Plan 2 to TRS Plan 3 before January 20, 2002. The superior court dismissed their claim that the DRS was required to pay class members daily interest on the full balance of employee contributions transferred between Plan 2 and Plan 3. The appellate court reversed on appeal, holding that although the DRS had the authority to decide how to calculate interest, its interest calculation method was arbitrary and capricious because a decision was not rendered after due consideration. The DRS consistently recognized the advantages that would have been realized by moving to a more frequent interest calculation, but rejected such a move without identifying any reasons for doing so. The decision to continue using the quarterly interest calculation method was therefore undertaken in willful and unreasoning disregard of the facts and circumstances, making it arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was acquitted on grounds of insanity of one count of first degree attempted arson. The court concluded that the trial court was not required to find that defendant was a substantial danger to other persons or presented a substantial likelihood of committing criminal acts jeopardizing public safety and security. Given that the trial court found that defendant did not adhere to the terms and conditions of his release, revocation of his conditional release based on that finding alone was proper. Moreover, the trial court did in fact make a finding as to dangerousness. Defendant failed to prove the unconstitutionality of &sect; 10.77.190 beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court did not err in applying the preponderance of the evidence standard. Defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to show he was dangerous was not relevant to whether the trial court properly revoked his conditional release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Snohomish Superior Court, Washington, granted judgment in favor of respondent Department of Labor and Industries (Department) by concluding that there was a rational basis for requiring appellant employer to pay a fee. The court set aside the Department's denial of the employer's appeal, and remanded it to the State of Washington Electrical Board (Board). The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer argued that the filing fee requirement under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.28.131 violated his due process rights under the state and federal constitution. The appellate court noted that the employer's interest was solely monetary. There was no constitutional due process right to appeal civil cases involving only property or financial interests. The $200 fees imposed on the employer did not violate his due process rights. The superior court's decision to reduce the fee favored the employer, and the Department did not appeal this result. The employer was not an aggrieved party, and thus could not seek review by the appellate court. The employer was entitled to receive his $200 filing fee as the prevailing party, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.84.010.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The reduction of the administrative filing fee was affirmed and the reinstatement of the appeal contingent upon payment of that fee, and remanded to the trial court for the award of the court filing fee to the employer for prevailing below.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the term, &quot;shortly after&quot; as referenced in &sect; 9.94A.535(3)(t) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that parents of developmentally disabled adult children should be treated the same as the parents of a minor child for purposes of the child wrongful death statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.010. The appellate court noted that the mother pointed to no authority in support of her argument that a developmentally disabled and legally incapacitated adult child over the age of 18 was a minor for purposes of the child wrongful death statute. While the mother remained actively involved in her son's life, she was not financially responsible for him. There was no dispute the State and federal disability benefits paid for the son's care. The mother could not show conclusively that the classification was contrary to the legislation's purposes. The limitations on the parents of adult children was not contrary to the purpose of the statute. Because financial dependence was a reasonable basis for determining whether a parent of an adult child could bring an action for the death of an adult child, the appellate court rejected the mother's constitutional challenge to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.010.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The King County Superior Court, Washington, upheld the order of the Board of Industrial Appeals (Board) affirming the Industrial Appeals Judge's ruling that Tobin did not apply because appellant employee's settlement did not allocate special damages. The trial court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment in respondent Washington State Department of Labor and Industries' (Department) favor. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee argued that her failure to allocate did not make her entire settlement subject to distribution. She argued that she was not obligated to allocate because the third-party recovery statute was ambiguous and the Department was not required to respect allocations for general damages. The appellate court found that prior cases unambiguously indicated to workers that in order to make the claim that any part of their third-party recovery should be excluded from the Department's lien, they had to allocate. It was impossible to verify from the record that any part of the employee's settlement in fact constituted funds to which the Department was not entitled under Tobin.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant county appealed a judgment of the Yakima Superior Court (Washington) that reversed the denial of a construction permit and held that the denial of a permit to allow the placement of a manufactured home in plaintiff landowner's mobile home park violated the landowner's substantive due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner held title to a mobile home park. When one of the homes fell into disrepair, a prospective tenant applied for a construction permit that would allow the placement of a newer mobile home on the lot. A county building official denied the application after concluding that the mobile home park was in a floodway and that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 86.16.041, the floodplain management ordinances, prohibited new residential construction, including placement of a manufactured home, in floodways. The landowner sought judicial review; the trial court reversed, concluding that the application's denial violated the landowner's due process rights. On review, the court held that the restrictions on development that were calculated to avoid property damage and injury in a designated floodplain were reasonable and did not violate the landowner's right to substantive due process of law. The county included the mobile home park in the floodplain based upon a history of recent flooding in the area, and while the effect was to prohibit replacement of mobile homes in the park for those destroyed or otherwise removed, that was nevertheless a proper exercise of the county's police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant state agency appealed an order of the Spokane Superior Court (Washington) that denied its motion for summary judgment in the wrongful death action of plaintiffs, the mother and brother of a decedent, arguing that plaintiffs lacked standing under the wrongful death statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.20.020; the survival statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.20.046; and the wrongful death of child statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.010.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The 52-year-old decedent lived in a state residential care facility for the developmentally disabled. After she was left unattended in a bathtub and drowned, her mother and brother filed a wrongful death suit. The state agency moved to dismiss, arguing that plaintiffs lacked standing under Washington law. On review of the motion's denial, the court held that the decedent's parent and sibling lacked standing to sue under the wrongful death statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.20.020; the survival statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.20.046; and the wrongful death of child statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.010, because the decedent, though mentally disabled, was an adult at the time of her death and plaintiffs were not dependent on her for support. The legislature declined to include non-dependent parents and siblings as beneficiaries under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.20.020. Further, survival claim damages under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.20.046 were limited to the prospective net accumulations of the decedent, and it was undisputed that the decedent had no prospective accumulations. Lastly, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.010 did not apply because, despite her mental disability, the decedent was an adult, not a child.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to life in prison for the first degree aggravated murder conviction and imposed further time for the other convictions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered the offices of the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle armed with two pistols and demanded to speak with a manager. When she came out to meet him, defendant began shooting. He killed one woman and seriously injured five other victims. Doctors diagnosed and treated defendant for bipolar disorder with psychotic features; defendant asserted an insanity defense. The court rejected defendant's claims that Wash. Rev.

There was no settled common law in Washington requiring the State to prove a defendant's sanity before a 1904 decision imposing that burden on defendants. The court refused to consider defendant's claim that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.77.020(5) was unconstitutional based on separation of powers because defendant failed to raise this issue below and failed to show that the error was manifest under Wash. R.

Code &sect; 36.70A.172(1) when it enacted the challenged vegetation regulation. The county identified many scientific studies that it relied upon in adopting the regulation, but did not explicitly analyze how the studies supported its decision to prohibit vegetation removal. The court held that the county complied with the statute, addressed the relevant sources of the best available scientific information as required by Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 365-195-915(1)(b), and the studies and reports discussed the importance of vegetation in the river environment. The county prohibited vegetation removal and development in areas determined to be high risk critical areas, and any dedications of land within those areas were de facto reasonably necessary as a direct result of the proposed development. A challenge to the regulation based on Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.02.020 failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner's property was subjected to a lien for the cost of weed eradication by the control board. The owner sued, challenged the establishment of the control board and its authority to act. The trial court dismissed the action. The court affirmed on appeal. The language of the resolution in question did not purport to adopt Wash. Rev. Code ch. 17.10 by reference and thus make it local law. The only purported violation of the Open Meeting Act the court could discern was that the date on which the resolution was adopted was not the date the owner claimed was the date fixed by law or rule referred to in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.30.060(1). The owner insisted that the 10-day notice requirement of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.32.120(7) applied, but the court had rejected this argument, and no Open Meeting Act violation was shown. The owner's failure to provide the amended complaint required by Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 15(a) was a sufficient reason for denying the motion. The trial court saw that the county and control board were prejudiced by the owner's request for leave to file an unprepared amended complaint, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</SPAN></P>

The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court noted that the Special Commitment Center (SCC) superintended authorized the patient to petition for unconditional release under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090(1). The State argued that there was nothing inconsistent about the statutory procedure for ordering a new trial and a separate process by which the prosecuting agency could agree to dismiss an action when there was insufficient evidence to proceed. If the State accepted the Department of Social and Health Services recommendation and concluded that it could not meet its burden, it was full consistent with &sect; 71.09.090 for the State to stipulate to dismissal. Forcing the State to proceed when it could not prove the case would be inconsistent with other SVP statutes, due process, and the prosecutor's ethical obligation to prosecute only cases it can prove. The trial court erred in refusing to accept the agreed order dismissing the State's SVP petition and granting the patient unconditional release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted in the King County Superior Court (Washington) of second degree assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of second degree assault for injuring his girlfriend. The court affirmed his conviction, but remanded for resentencing. In deciding whether to review appellant's constitutional claim for the first time on appeal, the court found that he did present a constitutional issue related to the right to confront witnesses, and the alleged error was manifest because the victim's hearsay statements were crucial to the State's case and prejudicial to the defense, and appellant had no opportunity to cross-examine the victim. However, several facts indicated that appellant consciously waived his right to confrontation, given that counsel's objections made it clear that counsel was well aware of appellant's confrontation rights, and appellant gained tactical advantages from allowing the statements. Thus, the court declined to review the Confrontation Clause claims. Appellant was not denied his right to present a defense. Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.530, the State presented no proof that appellant's Ohio conviction was comparable to the Washington felony, and relying on appellant's silence at sentencing was insufficient, such that the court remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury of the Pierce County Superior Court, Washington, found defendant guilty of first degree rape, second degree child rape, two counts of first degree kidnapping, two counts of felony harassment, and first degree assault. Defendant appealed his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress all of the evidence obtained after his arrest, including the admission of the victims' testimonies at trial. According to defendant, the warrantless search of a motel guest registry was an unlawful search, and that the inevitable discovery rule was an invalid basis for denying his suppression motion. The court concluded that the victims' testimonies were admissible under the independent source exception to the exclusionary rule. The victims' testimonies were sufficiently attenuated from the illegal motel registry search. Although arguably entry into the motel room violated defendant's rights under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, the entry was to aid one of the victims and not to search for evidence. This victim sought law enforcement officers' assistance as community caretakers after the officers had arrested defendant on an outstanding warrant and were preparing to leave. Defendant's convictions for first degree rape and second degree child rape did not constitute double jeopardy because they were not legally comparable crimes. The trial court did not violate defendant's constitutional speedy trial rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant former stepfather petitioned for a designation as a child's de facto parent or to be awarded nonparental custody of the child. The Clark Superior Court (Washington) dismissed the de facto parentage action, but ordered a show cause hearing on the nonparental custody action, finding that the stepfather had established adequate cause. On motion by respondent mother, the court granted discretionary review. The stepfather cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stepfather sought either de facto parent designation or an award of nonparental custody. The trial court dismissed the de facto parentage action, but otherwise ordered a show cause hearing. The court affirmed the adequate cause finding, reversed the dismissal of the parentage action, and remanded. The court held that case law precluded stepparents and former stepparents from acquiring de facto parent status only when the child had two existing, fit parents. Here, the child had only one living biological parent, his mother, when the stepfather entered his life, and thus case law did preclude the stepfather from asserting a de facto parentage claim. Because the child did not have two existing parents, the availability of nonparental custody under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.10.030 did not preclude the stepfather's de facto parent action. The court held that where a child had only one existing parent when a former stepparent entered the child's life, the former stepparent could set forth a de facto parentage claim. The stepfather met his burden of production under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.10.032(1) and the facts supported a finding of adequate cause that entitled him to a show cause hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the adequate cause finding, reversed the dismissal of the de facto parentage action, and remanded for a show cause hearing on the nonparental custody action and for a hearing on whether the stepfather was the child's de facto parent. Each party was to bear its own costs and fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted in the King County Superior Court (Washington) of first-degree murder and unlawful possession of a firearm. A jury answered yes on a special verdict for a firearm enhancement. Appellant was sentenced as a persistent offender to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant raised certain issues on appeal. The court vacated the firearms sentence enhancement but otherwise affirmed. The special verdict instruction, saying that all 12 jurors had to agree in order to answer the special verdict form, misstated the law. The court followed case law and held that the instructional error in this case was not harmless. Where an instructional error in this regard compelled vacation of an exceptional sentence, the trial court could impanel a jury upon remand to consider the aggravating factor with proper instructions. The court rejected appellant's claim that the Persistent Offender Accountability Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.570, violated his federal constitutional rights. The federal and state constitutions and the Act allowed a trial judge to determine the existence of prior convictions used to enhance a sentence. Counsel was not ineffective as claimed. The jury was instructed that to convict appellant of first-degree murder, it had to find that either he or an accomplice killed the victim, for purposes of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.32.030, 9A.08.020, and thus which bullets caused the victim's death did not affect apellant's guilt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the firearms sentence enhancement, but otherwise affirmed the cnviction and sentence and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) entered a summary judgment order affirming a hearing examiner's decision finding that appellant pet owner's dog was a dangerous animal under Pierce County, Wash., Code &sect; 6.07.015. The pet owner challenged the superior court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although the county's interest in protecting the public from dangerous animals was strong, requiring the responding party to pay a fee to access any review of a government initiated action could prevent many people from obtaining the review they were legally entitled to before deprivation of a property interest. Thus, charging a fee to obtain an initial evidentiary review of a dangerous animal declaration (DAD) proceeding violated due process because (1) the DAD impacted the pet owner's property and financial interests, and (2) potentially subjected the pet owner to future criminal sanctions. Therefore, Pierce County, Wash., Code &sect; 6.017.015(E)(1)'s administrative fee requirement was unenforceable. Also, the hearing examiner's review was the first evidentiary review and not a true appellate review, and the $500 fee was inappropriate because it could preclude legitimate challenges to DADs. Thus, Pierce County, Wash., Code &sect; 6.07.015(E)(3)'s filing fee requirement violated due process. Finally, lack of an adequate evidentiary standard in Pierce County, Wash., Code &sect; 6.07.015(A) violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that charging a fee to obtain adversarial/evidentiary review of a DAD violated due process and that the county's DAD ordinance did not establish an adequate standard of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The King County Superior Court, Washington, convicted defendant of assault in the second degree and found, by special verdict, that the injuries sustained by the victim substantially exceeded the level of bodily harm necessary to satisfy the elements of that crime. The trial court imposed a sentence beyond the standard sentence range. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by imposing the exceptional sentence. The appellate court found that the jury could find that defendant did not intend to inflict great bodily harm upon the victim but he did inflict such harm recklessly, thus supporting both the jury's guilty verdict and its special verdict. The severe injuries sustained by the victim were sufficient to constitute great bodily harm as required to support the exceptional sentence. The jury made the only finding necessary to authorize the imposition of the exceptional sentence. The jury's general verdicts and special verdict could be harmonized, and the jury's special verdict finding authorized the imposition of defendant's exceptional sentence. Moreover, the absence of an instruction to the jury further defining the alleged aggravating circumstance did not compel the vacation of that exceptional sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A district court jury convicted defendant of obstructing a law enforcement officer, in violation of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the jury had sufficient evidence to convict defendant of obstruction. A jury could have reasonably inferred from the facts that defendant had heard the officers' identification and commands to open a trailer's door and to exit the trailer with his hands up but had decided not to comply and knew that the officers wanted to look inside the trailer to investigate a recent disturbance. The court rejected defendant's contention that he had a constitutional right to refuse to provide his name and date of birth or to refuse to open the door and reveal his presence to officers. Section 9A.76.020 was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant because he was not privileged from revealing his name, date of birth, or presence to police. Defendant's refusal to open the door, reveal his presence, and exit with his hands up was substantive evidence of his guilt of the crime of obstruction. The State properly elicited testimony that defendant refused to obey the officers' orders by not exiting the trailer with his hands up. It followed that the State could use this properly elicited testimony in closing argument to argue that defendant committed obstruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) 1) granted partial summary judgment to respondent, holding appellant sergeant liable for violating her Fourth Amendment rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983; 2) denied his cross-motion and all defendants' summary judgment motion to dismiss respondent's &sect; 1983 claim against appellant, based on qualified immunity; and 3) awarded attorney fees and costs of $340,654.14 against appellant. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Federal law was sufficiently clear on July 28, 2004, to give the sergeant fair warning that the Fourth Amendment prohibited him from physically entering respondent's residence without a warrant, court order, or other justification. Also, neither protection order contained the statutory language in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.50.080 authorizing defendant ex-husband to retrieve his possessions from respondent's residence or authorizing any law enforcement officer to accompany the ex-husband to assist in placing him in possession of any items. The legal effect of the protection orders was not uncertain - clearly neither entitled the ex-husband to a so-called &quot;civil standby&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.50.080. Thus, the trial court's summary judgment orders in favor of respondent on her 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims were properly granted because no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that the sergeant's physical entry into respondent's residence - without the authorization of either protection order, a warrant, or exigent circumstances - was lawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment rulings in respondent's favor, vacated the trial court's attorney fees and costs award, and remanded with instructions to reduce the award to include attorney fees and costs attributable only to respondent's litigation of her &sect; 1983 claim against appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother appealed from an order of the Spokane County Superior Court, Washington, which summarily denied her motion to regain custody of her child from respondent, the child's maternal grandmother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant had relinquished custody of her child during a time she was struggling with substance abuse. The court concluded that the procedural and substantive hurdles to modifying a custody decree provided by Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 26.09.260 and 26.09.270 were unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case. The trial court heard no evidence from which it could, or did, make findings that appellant was an unfit parent or that her custody of the child would result in actual detriment to the child. The modification standards and process provided by &sect;&sect; 26.09.260 and 26.09.270 interfered with appellant's right to rear her child, and they failed strict scrutiny analysis because respondent never demonstrated that appellant was an unfit parent or that placing appellant's child with respondent would result in actual detriment to the child's growth and development. It was constitutional error to require appellant to satisfy the requirements of &sect;&sect; 26.09.260 and 26.09.270; instead, the placement of the child was to be decided applying the parentally-protective best interest standard of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.10.100.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's order was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who admitted to police that he forged and cashed a corporation's check, argued that the trial court erred in convicting him of identity theft because the corporation did not qualify as a &quot;person&quot; under the identity theft statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.35.020. The court concluded that the statutory definition of &quot;person&quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.110(17) expressly includes a corporation. The legislature incorporated this statutory definition into the identity theft statute. Accordingly, defendant's contention that a corporation cannot qualify as a person for purposes of the identity theft statute failed. Because the definition of person in &sect; 9A.04.110(17) is not ambiguous, the rule of lenity was not available. The court rejected defendant's vagueness challenge because the identity theft statute and the relevant definitional statute defining &quot;person&quot; are directed at identifiable articulable conduct, have a reasonably definite focus, and do not encourage arbitrary enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed defendant's conviction and dismissed the prosecution. The court found that defendant's conduct showed more than simple nervousness and supported the officer's pat-down. under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. However, the State made no compelling case why an alien legally in this country should be treated any differently than a citizen, for purposes of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.170. The statute denied due process of law by discriminating between legal aliens and citizens, and it denied legal aliens the equal protection of law by denying their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. In defending the constitutionality of former &sect; 9.41.170, the State cited to no case that held that the government could deny aliens legally in this country rights guaranteed by the constitution as fundamental, and that included the right to bear arms.</SPAN></P>

Any rational trier of fact could have found that the shooting involved a &quot;destructive impact&quot; on the students, teachers, and administrators at the school. The shooting occurred in a public school hallway populated with students and staff. At least two students witnessed the killing from a distance of less than 10 feet. One of the students received medical treatment for irritation to her eyes. Another student who witnessed the shooting spoke with a counselor afterward. That student testified that the shooting &quot;affected me tremendously. It made me realize that I could die any time and that bad things happen.&quot; A teacher who heard the shots suffered insomnia after the incident and felt more distant from friends and family who had not experienced the trauma of the shooting. Defendant killed a fellow student at his school in front of his schoolmates. Several teachers and administrators heard the shooting and tried to save the victim.</SPAN></P>

By special verdict, the jury also found that he was armed with a deadly weapon, a knife. He was sentenced to 234 months in prison. On appeal, he claimed that the trial court violated his constitutional right to present a defense by excluding evidence that his son committed the crime. The court found that there was no evidence establishing a nexus between the son and the crime. There was no physical evidence connecting the son to the crime. No eyewitness placed him at the scene of the crime. Despite many opportunities to do so, the wife never identified her son as her attacker. No witness presented direct evidence substantially contravening the State's version of events. There was no evidence of any step taken by the son that indicated an &quot;intention to act&quot; on his alleged motive. The only evidence defendant relied on was a statement made by the son when he was admittedly intoxicated, and that he later repeatedly recanted. The trial court did not err in excluding the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a Caucasian, was convicted of malicious harassment of an Ethiopian parking-lot attendant. On appeal, the court found that defendant's words and conduct established that he was guilty of intentionally and maliciously harassing the victim because of her race, ethnicity, or national origin. There was no question that defendant was angry about a parking ticket, but that anger escalated and his behavior changed as soon as he saw the victim. After he saw the victim, he immediately started using offensive racial epithets, got out of his truck, and confronted her in an aggressive manner. The victim's belief that defendant wanted to kill her because she gave him a parking ticket did not undermine the evidence at trial showing that he threatened her because of her race. Sufficient evidence supported the finding that defendant made a &quot;true threat.&quot; After driving over to the victim in an aggressive manner, defendant got out of his truck and immediately started hurling racial epithets at her. When she told him she was going to call the police, he said that he did not care and that he knew where she worked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Clallam Superior Court (Washington) allowed respondent to withdraw a 1991 guilty plea in a juvenile second degree burglary case, vacated the related disposition, denied the State's request to amend the charging documents to designate a different predicate offense for unlawful firearm possession charges, and dismissed the firearm charges with prejudice. The State appealed in this consolidated action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that respondent did not have notice that he would lose his ability to possess firearms as a result of his 1991 adjudication. The court reversed and remanded. The trial court erred in applying Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 4.2's manifest injustice standard to the post-conviction plea withdrawal motion, which was governed by Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8. Manifest injustice was not one of the enumerated reasons for post-judgment relief under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8(b). The manifest injustice basis could not support relief from a final judgment in a Rule 7.8 motion. Respondent's challenge could be considered a challenge to the constitutionality of his 1991 disposition because he was not aware that his guilty plea would result in losing his Second Amendment rights, but the extension of the firearm statute to juvenile felony dispositions did not occur until after the disposition, and did not render his guilty plea unconstitutional. The trial court's duty to inform juvenile defendants of the loss of firearm rights did not take effect until 1994, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.047. There was no basis for finding that respondent did not knowingly enter his plea.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the legislature's authorization of county sheriffs under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130(7) (2006) to determine sex offenders' reporting date during the 90 day reporting period violated separation of powers principles because it allowed sheriffs to define an essential element of the crime of failure to register as a sex offender. The court concluded the legislature's delegation to the county sheriffs was administrative, allowing each county to manage the reporting requirement in accord with its staffing levels and staff availability, and the delegation did not violate separation of powers principles. Authorizing sheriffs to set the reporting date did not violate equal protection guarantees. Former &sect; 9A.44.130(7) was not unconstitutionally vague. A person of ordinary intelligence would have understood that failure to report on the designated reporting date was a crime. Sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction. The trial court's unchallenged findings established that defendant had a fixed residence and knowingly failed to register on the designated reporting date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court found that the association's current complaint concerned a different and broader appropriation of tax revenues that prohibited the appellate court's application of collateral estoppel. The association argued that the 2009 appropriation could not constitute a refund under Wash. Const. art. II, &sect; 40(d) because it provided no benefit to those who paid the taxes being refunded, particularly off-road vehicle (ORV) users. The appellate court found that the 2009 appropriation of the excess fund balance fell within the refund that former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.09.170 authorized. The nonhighway and off-road vehicle activities (NOVA) fund accommodated several other types of nonhighway recreation, and it would be unconstitutional to exclude the taxpayers who engaged in those types of recreation from the refund program in favor of ORV users exclusively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mobile home park and others appealed a judgment of the Thurston County Superior Court, Washington, which issued a permanent injunction enjoining the park from transferring to its tenants the responsibility of maintaining the carports and storage sheds the park had constructed on its tenants' lots.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the trial court properly ruled that the mobile home park's letter, asking tenants to sign an agreement transferring the ownership and responsibility for maintenance of the storage sheds and carports from the landlord to the tenants, violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 59.20.135. By its plain language, &sect; 59.20.135 unambiguously prohibited the park owner from transferring responsibility to care for the park's permanent structures, including carports and storage sheds, to the park's tenants. The court did not need to address retroactivity of the statute because substantial evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that it had always been the tenants' responsibility to conduct daily maintenance of the structures and that there was no evidence that the park transferred to the tenants the responsibility of conducting major repairs before the enactment of the statute in 1994. However, the trial court erred in finding that a contract implied in fact existed between the parties. There was no mutual intent to enter into an agreement that the park would not dispose of a tenant's carport and storage shed as long as the tenant remained at the mobile home park.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded with instructions to vacate the portion of the injunction permanently enjoining the park from removing the carports or storage sheds without the tenants' uncoerced written consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff corporation requested a declaration that a ballot initiative exceeded the scope of the local initiative power and an injunction to prevent governmental defendants from placing the initiative on the ballot. The Whatcom County Superior Court, Washington, denied plaintiff's request for declaratory and injunctive relief and granted defendant initiative sponsors' special motion to strike plaintiff's claim. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city council enacted an ordinance that established a system of automated traffic safety cameras to enforce certain traffic infractions. The city entered into a contract with plaintiff to install an automatic traffic safety camera system. The initiative would prohibit the city from installing or using an automatic traffic camera system unless approved by a majority of the city council and a majority of the voters. The court concluded that the proposed initiative expressly restricted the city's legislative authority by conditioning its use on a concurrence by the majority of the voters. The subject matter of the initiative was clearly beyond the scope of the local initiative power. Therefore, the initiative was invalid. The trial court erred in granting a special motion to strike plaintiff's claim under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.24.525. Plaintiff met its burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence a probability of prevailing on its claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the denial of plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction, but otherwise reversed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of first degree robbery, first degree burglary, and two counts of second degree assault under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.56.200, 9A.52.020(1)(b), 9A.36.021(1)(e). The assault convictions were ordered merged with the robbery conviction. On remand for resentencing, the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) allowed the State to introduce evidence under amendments to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On remand, the resentencing court permitted the State to introduce additional evidence proving appellant's criminal history under the 2008 amendments to the Act. The court affirmed the application of the amendments, but remanded for a certain determination. Although appellant claimed that the amendments to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.94A.525(21), 9.94A.530(2) increased the severity of his punishment, his prior convictions could be used to calculate his offender score both before and after the amendments. The amendments were procedural and did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses because they were neither retrospective nor disadvantageous to appellant. Because appellant was on notice that his criminal history would be used to calculate his offender score and he had the ability to calculate his standard range when he committed his crime, he was not disadvantaged by the amendments. Based on the facts of the case, the legislature did not exceed its authority when it amended the Act to require trial courts to impose sentences based on the defendant's actual criminal history, even if not fully known or disclosed at the original sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the application of the amendments to appellant's resentencing hearing. The court remanded to the resentencing court to determine whether the failure to include a 1998 conviction was (1) a scrivener's error and to correct the judgment and sentence, or (2) not a scrivener's error and to resentence appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant had two prior convictions for &quot;sexually violent offenses,&quot; second-degree rape and second-degree child molestation.

The State filed a SVP petition, seeking his involuntary civil commitment as a SVP. A licensed psychologist and certified sex offender treatment provider diagnosed appellant with paraphilia and pedophilia. A jury found appellant to be a SVP and the trial court ordered him committed until such time as his mental abnormality and/or personality disorder so changed that he was safe to be conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative or unconditionally discharged. On appeal, the court held that a mental health examination ordered by the trial court did not violate appellant's right to privacy under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The trial court appropriately followed both Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.040(4) and Wash. Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 388-880-034(1) and 388-880-35 when it ordered the mental health examination after finding probable cause to believe that appellant met the criteria for a SVP.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the Whatcom County Superior Court (Washington) found defendant guilty of six counts of second degree rape of a child. The appellate court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the State presented to a jury evidence of two aggravating factors. The jury found each aggravating factor proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">For purposes of a defendant's right to a public trial under the Sixth Amendment and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10, 22, simply because the door between the courtroom and chambers was open and the judge called the proceeding public did not mean it was public as a member of the public would not have recognized chambers as a public space and that person likely would not have understood that he could enter and observe the proceedings. Moving voir dire from a public courtroom to chambers due to privacy concerns but then calling the ensuing proceeding public did not make it so. Thus, the appellate court rejected the State's contention that no closure occurred. Because defendant stated through defense counsel on the record that he personally had no objection to the closure after he discussed the issue with counsel, his statement constituted a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his right to a public trial. Because he waived his right to a public trial, he could not complain on appeal that the superior court interviewed a juror in chambers without first applying and weighing the Bone-Club factors on the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the superior court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a bench trial, the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) found defendant guilty of one count of failing to register as a sex offender under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130 (2006). He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because defendant had no fixed address, under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130(6)(b) (2006), he had to report once a week to the sheriff's office in the county in which he was then residing to confirm his presence in that county. While there, defendant had to also fill out new paperwork requiring him to account for where he stayed during the past week. Although defendant testified that weekly reporting was inconvenient, inconvenience alone did not make the statute punitive. Defendant failed to prove that the sex offender registration statute, former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.130 (2006), was punitive and failed beyond a reasonable doubt that the transient registration provision violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Washington Constitutions. Also, because he could register in the county in which he was then residing, the statute did not impede travel, and the transient registration requirements were not facially invalid. Finally, defendant failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the registration statute, as applied to him, interfered with his right to travel. Thus, the sex offender registration statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Clallam County Superior Court, Washington, which convicted him of solicitation of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of solicitation of fourth degree assault. Defendant never directly said that he wanted the intended victim murdered. He stated only that he wanted her to &quot;disappear,&quot; which, depending on the circumstances, could mean a number of things, including fourth degree assault. He also maintained throughout police questioning and at trial that he never intended to have the intended victim murdered and that he only thought a hit man would only scare her. The evidence here, when viewed in the light most favorable to defendant, supported an inference that only the lesser crime of solicitation to commit fourth degree assault was committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayers sought to have certain provisions of the Washington Humane Slaughter of Livestock Act - Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 16.50.110(3)(b) and 16.50.150 - declared unconstitutional and stricken from the Act. The Snohomish Superior Court (Washington) found that the Act did not violate the federal or state constitution, and dismissed the case. The taxpayers appealed, and the State cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the appellate court did not believe that the legislature would have enacted the Act absent the challenged provisions and because striking only those provisions would broaden the scope of the Act, the challenged provisions, even if unconstitutional, could not be severed from the remainder of the Act. The taxpayers requested that only the challenged provisions be struck, which the appellate court could not do because, if the appellate court invalidated only those provisions challenged by the taxpayers, a sole statutory humane method of slaughter would remain. Methods of slaughter that comport with religious requirements - currently lawful pursuant to the Act - would be rendered unlawful. Livestock slaughterers not currently subject to criminal penalties would become so, contrary to the intention of the legislature, which expressly deemed ritual slaughter to be humane and, therefore, lawful. Also, the judicial determination of the issues raised by the taxpayers would not conclusively resolve the parties' dispute. Thus, the taxpayers' claim was not justiciable. The relief sought could not be obtained, and the relief that could be obtained was not sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Snohomish Superior Court, Washington, granted respondent city's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the city was authorized to issue taxpayer bonds, and to the extent available, the city had the authority to allow businesses and private individuals to use the current excess capacity of its fiber optic network. Appellant taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer argued that the city did not have the statutory authority to issue taxpayer obligation bonds to expand the fiber optic network for both a public purpose and the stated intent to allow private individuals and businesses to use the available current excess capacity. The appellate court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35A.40.080 unambiguously allowed a code city to issue taxpayer bonds as authorized by other statutes, including Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 35.37.040 and 39.36.020. The record supported the determination that the city's issuance of bonds to expand the fiber optic network furthered public purposes. The city's plan to allow additional public sector and intergovernmental agencies, and private individuals and businesses to use the current network to the extent capacity was available did not violate Wash. Const. art. VII, &sect; I. It did not violate Wash. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 7 as there was no question that the city would own the fiber optic network and planned to charge private individuals or businesses to use the available current excess capacity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Kitsap Superior Court (Washington) granted summary judgment in favor of respondent, a deputy prosecutor, on appellant's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution based on qualified immunity. Appellant challenged the trial court's judgment. Respondent cross-appealed, arguing that she was entitled to absolute immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There was no evidence in the record to suggest that respondent was actually suborning perjury or that a reasonable prosecutor would have believed that she was suborning perjury. Appellant's argument was based solely on speculation and conjecture. The facts demonstrated that respondent talked with a witness for only a very brief time and afterward only asked a deputy to talk to the witness again. Respondent then went on vacation after that and the charging decisions were made by others. Although appellant speculated that respondent encouraged the witness to lie or exaggerate, there was no evidence of that. Thus, appellant failed to raise any material issues of fact on that issue. Therefore, the trial court correctly held that respondent was entitled to qualified immunity. Additionally, respondent's brief conversation with the witness and her follow-up conversation and request of the deputy were carried out to determine whether to bring additional charges against appellant. Based on that, respondent's conduct was not only subject to qualified immunity as the trial court held, but also subject to absolute immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's order granting summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant citizen challenged a decision of the King County Superior Court (Washington), which (1) entered one injunction against him enjoining the release of certain information, and (2) entered a second injunction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.56.544 as amended, enjoining all pending and future records requests by the citizen to respondent Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention. The citizen also filed other motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated appeal, the citizen challenged both injunctions. The court affirmed. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.56.565 did not direct a specific result. It granted he trial court discretion in determining whether to grant an injunction based on the facts presented. The court concluded that the statute did not create a liberty interest that was subject to due process protections. Section 42.56.565(2) clearly described the kind of conduct that the statute was intended to deter, and these factors were not unconstitutionally vague. The United States Supreme Court recently stated that the Act was not a prohibition on speech, but instead a disclosure requirement. Disclosure requirements might burden the ability to speak, but they did not prevent anyone from speaking, and the court agreed. Section 42.56.565 did not limit one's right to publish material critical of state agencies or prohibit one from speaking in any other manner he chose. The statute created a procedure to enjoin the disclosure of nonexempt public records under certain limited circumstances, which did not offend the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed. The citizen's motions were denied. The court ordered consolidation of the record on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant applicant challenged an order of the Spokane Superior Court (Washington) that affirmed the denial of her application for a day care licensed by appellee state agency, arguing that the state agency lacked the authority to enact Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 170-296-0450 and that the agency's decision was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant operated a day care facility out of home until her license was revoked due to her husband's illegal drug use in the family home before receiving a authorization for medical marijuana use. The applicant reapplied for a license, but her application was denied based upon her prior license revocation. On review, the court held that the plain language of the state agency's enabling statute plainly showed legislative intent for the agency to have rule-making authority over licensing procedures. Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 170-296-0450, which required the denial of a license if the applicant had been disqualified, was a licensing procedure; therefore, the legislature intended to grant the state agency specific authority to enact Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 170-296-0450. Further, the denial of the license was not arbitrary and capricious because Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 170-06-0070(7)(e) made the denial of a license appropriate where an applicant previously had a license revoked. This, in addition to the applicant's failure to submit an employment and education resume and reference and her failure to complete a background check, supported the denial of her license application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The denial of a license to operate a day care facility was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that: (1) defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request a lesser included offense instruction for reckless driving, and (2) provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act unconstitutionally relieved the State of its burden of proof at sentencing. The court concluded that because defendant was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction, any claim to that effect at trial would have failed. Therefore, defendant failed to demonstrate that his counsel's performance prejudiced him, and his ineffective assistance claim failed. However, the court agreed with defendant that 2008 amendments to Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.94A.500 and 9.94A.530&nbsp;unconstitutionally relieved the State of its burden to prove defendant's prior convictions. The State provided no evidence whatsoever of defendant's prior convictions, failing to satisfy even minimal due process. An unsworn statement simply listed the crimes that the prosecutor believed defendant had been convicted of. Such allegations were not evidence. The trial court violated defendant's right to due process by sentencing him based on facts for which there was no evidence in the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of an order from the King County Superior Court (Washington), which involuntarily committed him as a sexually violent predator (SVP) pursuant to a petition filed by the State of Washington.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of rape of a child in the first degree in 1999. He was released to community custody in January 2006. Following his last arrest by his community custody officer (CCO) for violating the conditions of his release, the State commenced a civil commitment proceeding. A jury found that he was a SVP. The trial court ordered his involuntary commitment. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to prove that he committed a recent overt act, as defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(12). He actively wrote deviant sexual fantasies about children and masturbated to them. He also watched children's movies and masturbated to fantasies about the child actors. His statement to his CCO that &quot;if he was given the opportunity to reoffend, he would&quot; was sufficient to establish that he expressed an intent to inflict harm under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020. Appellant's threat and the evidence of his acts of writing sexual fantasies about children was sufficient evidence of a &quot;combination&quot; of an act and a threat. A psychologist testified that appellant suffered from pedophilia and that writing fantasies was part of his &quot;offense cycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county challenged a judgment of the King County Superior Court (Washington) that reversed a hearing officer's finding sustaining a citation issued to respondent property owner for maintaining a nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner was cited for a nonconforming use, and a hearing officer determined that, because the nonconforming use was partially carried out on neighboring property, the property owner was a trespasser and thus could not assert the nonconforming use exception to the applicability of zoning laws. The superior court reversed, and the county sought further review. On review, the court held that, while a trespasser could not establish a valid nonconforming use, the hearing officer failed to correctly apply that principle to the facts before him because the hearing officer failed to make any express findings that any use of the neighboring property was accomplished through trespass. The hearing examiner erred by presuming that, because the owners of the neighboring parcel had not explicitly agreed to or permitted the property owner's use of the neighboring parcel, the property owner was necessarily trespassing onto the neighboring parcel. Because the neighboring parcel was vacant, open, unenclosed, and unimproved, the presumption that the neighboring parcel owner acquiesced in another's use of that property applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The case was remanded for a decision as to whether the property owner established that use of the neighboring property existed prior to the enactment of the zoning ordinance at issue. If the property owner proved that fact, the presumption of permissive use of the property applied, and the hearing officer was to determine whether a valid nonconforming use existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent moved to dismiss the charges against him, arguing that he was exempt from prosecution under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.190(2)(b)(i), (ii). The trial court granted respondent's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The trial court erred when it ruled that the &sect; 9.41.190(2)(b) exemption was an element of the offense of unlawful possession of a machine gun that the State has the burden of establishing. The exemption was a defense that a defendant had the burden of establishing. The plain language of &sect; 9.41.190 did not support the conclusion that respondent was exempt from the prohibition against possessing a machine gun because he held a title 18 U.S.C.S. federal gun dealer's license without also having to show that he was entitled to own or possess a machine gun under federal law. Respondent's vagueness argument failed. For the &sect; 9.41.190(2)(b) exemption to apply, respondent had to show that he not only held a federal license but that the license, or some other federal exemption, allowed him to possess a machine gun, but he failed to meet this burden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The arrestee said it was error to transfer venue to the county where the case arose.

Summary judgment was proper as to malicious prosecution because (1) probable cause was shown by an officer's good faith disclosure to the prosecutor of the officers' investigation, and (2) no malice was shown, as it was not inferred absent affirmative evidence of improper motive or reckless disregard. Summary judgment was proper as to false arrest and false imprisonment because (1) no reasonable jury could find a lack of probable cause to arrest the arrestee, at the time of arrest, since his ex-wife appeared to have authority to consent to a search of his home, where a prohibited weapon was found, and (2) a prosecutor's filing of charges limited liability to damages previously accrued.

The court concluded that defendant's speedy trial rights were not violated. Defense counsel requested each of the continuances in order to be adequately prepared for trial. Although defendant objected to the majority of the continuances, he did not specify what prejudice he in fact suffered. Actual prejudice was required. None was present. Although defendant remained in custody for over 22 months, it was not necessarily an undue delay. This was particularly true because the continuances were all requested by defense counsel who asserted that she was not prepared to go to trial without necessary information. One of the reasons defense counsel sought the continuances was that she needed an expert to review the content on defendant's computer. There was probable cause to issue a search warrant. Defendant's roommate told both his community corrections officer and a police detective that he had seen child pornography on defendant's home computer. This was sufficient to establish knowledge. The warrant was sufficiently particular because it referenced the particular crimes being investigated in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that a police officer's pat down of defendant, a vehicle passenger, without reasonable, articulable, and individualized suspicion that he was armed and dangerous or independently connected to illegal activity, and the subsequent search of the vehicle violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. Police officers arrested the driver for driving with a suspended license. Neither officer testified that they suspected defendant was armed or engaged in criminal activity before beginning to search him. Before officers searched the vehicle, they had secured both the driver, the pertinent arrestee, and defendant in the back of a patrol car. Thus, neither the driver nor defendant posed a threat to officer safety or to concealment or destruction of the evidence. The court further concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support one of the second degree assault counts. In the absence of shots being fired into the house where the alleged victim was on the telephone and in the absence of any injury or apprehension and imminent fear of bodily injury, no trier of fact could have found all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that he had a right to attend a chambers meeting where the trial court considered issues related to forcibly medicating him. The court concluded that the chambers meeting concerned purely ministerial and legal matters and did not violate any of defendant's rights. No ruling was made during the meeting, and defendant's presence would not have influenced the ultimate outcome of the matters discussed at the meeting. Accordingly, defendant's rights were represented fully and not violated by his lack of attendance at the meeting. The chambers meeting did not implicate defendant's public trial rights under Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, because the meeting solely addressed ministerial matters regarding legal questions related to the process of deciding defense counsel's forced medication motion. Defendant's procedural due process rights were not violated by holding SVP proceedings despite his incompetence. Although defendant argued that the forced medication of antipsychotic drugs during his civil commitment hearing violated his due process rights, the record did not clearly establish that he was forcibly medicated during his SVP trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer argued that the trial court erred by denying its jury trial demand and finding the settlement was reasonable. The court concluded that the trial court properly denied the jury trial demand. The hearing to determine the reasonableness of the settlement under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.22.060 was an equitable proceeding with no right to trial by jury. The trial court properly exercised its discretion in determining reasonableness. The trial court examined the Chaussee/Glover factors and specifically found in light of those factors that the settlement was reasonable and not the product of fraud or collusion. The evidence submitted in support of the motion for a finding of reasonableness was voluminous, constituting well over several thousand pages, and included testimony from several witnesses. The trial court had sufficient information before it to make an informed reasonableness determination. Given the extent of damages, the plumbing company's liability and financial circumstances, and the risks and costs of future litigation, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that $3,989,914.83 was a reasonable settlement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant attended a party with friends who were taking methamphetamine. Defendant brought methadone with him and gave several tablets to his friend. The friend died due to an overdose of methadone, methamphetamine, and alcohol. Defendant was charged with controlled substance homicide. On review, the court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.415 unambiguously required the State to prove that the methadone provided to the decedent by defendant was a proximate cause, but not the sole cause, of death. Although defendant's conduct would not be a proximate cause if some other cause was a sole or superseding cause, it could be a proximate cause if another cause was merely concurrent. Because a doctor who was a forensic pathologist and the county medical examiner who performed the autopsy opined that all three substances--methadone, alcohol, and methamphetamine--combined to cause death and that each one played a role, the evidence was sufficient to find that defendant's provision of the methadone was a concurrent cause of his friend's death, and that was sufficient to support his conviction of controlled substance homicide.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued that the trial court erred in ruling that rule 60(b) did not apply to the circumstances of his case. The court disagreed, holding that rule 60(b) is not the means by which an SVP may challenge orders that continue confinement as an SVP following an annual review hearing under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090. SVP postcommitment orders arising from annual review hearings that do not result in final unconditional release of the SVP are not final under rule 60(b). Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion to vacate the postcommitment order denying him a full evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Yakima County Superior Court, Washington, which convicted him of felony driving while under the influence, driving without an interlock device, and second degree driving while license suspended or revoked.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was observed driving his car off the road and into a canal located on an Indian reservation. The primary issue in this case was whether Washington's implied consent statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.20.308, could not be applied to defendant because of either Public Law 280 or a treaty with the tribe. Defendant argued that the State could not enforce the implied consent statute against an enrolled member of the tribe driving on state highways on the reservation. The court concluded that Public Law 280 did not bar the criminal prosecution of this case. The court noted that the implied consent statute is primarily a criminal statute rather than a civil regulatory statute. The State had authority under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 37.12.010(8) to prosecute defendant. A treaty with defendant's tribe did not bar the prosecution of this case. The right to travel guaranteed by the treaty with the tribe did not exempt defendant from the criminal statutes governing use of the roadways. Requiring defendant to drive with a valid license and without being impaired by alcohol or drugs did not impede his right to travel. The trial court correctly imposed a term of 9-18 months of community custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action to determine parentage of two children, appellant, who met the criteria for a &quot;de facto&quot; parent, filed a motion for genetic testing. The King County Superior Court, Washington, denied the motion, concluding that genetic testing was not in the best interest of the children. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the trial court erred in denying genetic testing. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.26.405 controlled the question whether genetic testing should be ordered. While respondent, who was the mother's former husband, was the presumed father of the children during his marriage to the mother, that status changed to adjudicated father by virtue of the dissolution of their marriage and a resulting child support order. The trial court appeared to have denied appellant's motion for genetic testing based on Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.26.535, which provides that a trial court may deny genetic testing if it concludes that such testing would not be in the child's best interest. But &sect; 26.26.535 only applies in proceedings to adjudicate the parentage of a child with a presumed father. Because this parentage action involved children with an adjudicated father, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.26.535 did not apply. Under the circumstances of this case, genetic testing was mandated. The court further concluded that &sect; 26.26.405 does not violate the equal protection clauses of the U.S. and Washington Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order denying genetic testing was reversed, and the case was remanded for entry of an order directing such testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and delivery of a controlled substance. The trial court imposed a 24-month sentencing enhancement based on a jury finding that he committed his crimes within 1,000 feet of a school bus route stop. On appeal, the court found that the trial court's concluding instruction erroneously required unanimity to acquit defendant of the aggravating factors of possessing and delivering a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school bus route stop. However, defendant did not object to the instruction. The trial court's failure to instruct the jury that it could acquit defendant of the aggravating factors non-unanimously was not an error of constitutional dimension. The giving of the challenged instruction had no practical and identifiable consequences on the record that should have been apparent to the trial court. The jury was able to make all of the findings required, applying the proper burden of proof, under the instructions given. Because the claimed instructional error was not manifest constitutional error under Wash. R. App. P. 2.5(a)(3), the court declined to review it for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a special education teacher, appealed a judgment of the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) that convicted her of fourth-degree assault under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.041(1) for dragging a special education student across the floor and swinging him into a bathroom during a lock-down drill, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to show that she had the requisite intent to commit assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school at which defendant worked as a special education teacher conducted a lock-down drill, during which teachers and students were to wait inside a bathroom. The victim, a student with Down Syndrome and limited verbal communication abilities, thought that the drill was an earthquake drill and hid under his desk. When defendant was unable to coax the victim out, she threw his desk aside, dragged him 25 feet by his wrist and ankle to the bathroom as he screamed hysterically, and swung him into the bathroom, where he slid several feet across the tile floor. On review of defendant's resulting assault conviction, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because, contrary to defendant's contention, the State was not required to establish malice or ill will. The intent required for assault was merely the intent to make physical contact with the victim, not the intent that the contact be a malicious or criminal act. Because it was uncontroverted that defendant intended to drag the victim across the floor, the evidence that defendant's touching was intentional was sufficient to demonstrate the element of intent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wash. R. Evid. 404(b) evidence was admissible only if defendant put on a particular defense. Because defendant did not testify, the appellate court could not predict exactly what would have been admitted at trial. Additionally, whether the convictions would have been used for an invalid purpose was speculative. Allowing defendant to challenge the admissibility of her convictions under Wash. R. Evid. 404(b) without testifying would arguably allow her to plant an error in her trial. The appellate court held that because defendant had not testified and preserved the issue regarding Wash. R. Evid. 404(b) evidence for appeal, it would not consider it. Defendant also argued that her constitutional right to present a defense was denied because had she testified, the State would have admitted her past convictions. The State's threat to rebut her testimony did not infringe on her right to present a defense. Defendant voluntarily decided not to testify, even after defense counsel advised her that she needed to testify in order to preserve the issue for appeal. Her failure to present a defense was the result of her own informed decision, not any action by the State or the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed the judgments of the Snohomish Superior Court (Washington) that convicted him of felony murder, first-degree murder, and unlawful possession of a firearm, arguing that the trial court violated their state and federal rights to a public trial by sealing jury questionnaires without conducting the analysis required under State v. Bone-Club.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Juror questionnaires were utilized asking about juror attitudes toward African-Americans and about firearms. After the jury was selected, the trial court sealed the questionnaires. On review of defendants' convictions, the court held that the trial court's failure to conduct a Bone-Club analysis prior to sealing the juror questionnaires did not violate defendants' right to a public trial Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 22; rather, it violated the public's right to open and accessible court proceedings under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. Violation of the public's right to open court records required remand for reconsideration of the order. The sealing order had no effect on defendants' public trial right and did not create defects affecting the framework within which trial proceeded; as such, it did not affect the validity of defendants' convictions. However, defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated because the entry of multiple convictions for the same crime violated double jeopardy even if they were only sentenced on one conviction. Defendants could not be convicted of both felony murder and first-degree murder for the same murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded to the trial court for reconsideration of its order sealing the juror questions under the Bone-Club analysis. The trial court was also directed to vacate defendants' first-degree murder convictions on double jeopardy grounds, leaving undisturbed defendants' felony murder convictions. In all other respects, the judgment of conviction and sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother's ex-boyfriend filed a petition against respondent mother seeking residential placement of the mother's child. The Spokane Superior Court (Washington) held that the ex-boyfriend was a de facto parent, but denied the petition, held that the Indian Child Welfare Act applied because the child was an Indian child, and held that the ex-boyfriend was not entitled to visitation. The ex-boyfriend appealed and the mother cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother and the ex-boyfriend were living together when the child was born. The ex-boyfriend was not the child's biological father, but he assumed the obligations for parenthood and the mother encouraged their relationship. The ex-boyfriend sought primary residential placement of the child as her de facto parent. The trial court ultimately denied the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court did not need to pass on whether the ex-boyfriend met the criteria for a de facto parent because even if the court assumed such status, the Indian Child Welfare Act applied, for purposes of 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1902, because the child was an Indian child, as defined in 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1903(4). The ex-boyfriend was not the child's biological or adoptive parent and the dispute here was not exempt from the Act's requirements. For purposes of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.33.040(1)(a), an Indian child's or her parent's physical, substantive, or cultural tie to a tribe was irrelevant as to whether the Act applies, and Washington no longer recognized the existing Indian family exception. The ex-boyfriend's constitutional contentions failed whether he had standing or not.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the dismissal of the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As a result of the assault, the victim suffered injuries to the face, a concussion without loss of consciousness, and neck and shoulder pain. Thus, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.110(4)(b), the victim sustained bodily injury involving a temporary but substantial disfigurement and temporary substantial impairment of a bodily part or organ function. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of second degree assault under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.021(1)(a). Also, the trial court did not violate defendant's constitutional due process rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments when the trial judge found the existence of defendant's prior convictions by a preponderance of the evidence for purposes of the Washington Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.94A. Finally, both the United States Supreme Court and the Washington Supreme Court expressly held that recidivist statutes such as the POAA were not constitutionally infirm, on due process, equal protection, or other grounds. Thus, defendant's argument that the POAA violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Pierce County Superior Court, Washington, that convicted her of first-degree kidnapping with special allegations of sexual motivation under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.835 (2006) and a victim less than 15 years old under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.837, first-degree child molestation with a special allegation of being predatory under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.836, and third-degree child rape.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the special allegation statutes violated the separation of powers doctrine because the legislature encroached on executive power by enacting statutes that limited the prosecutor's discretion by requiring the prosecutor to charge special allegations in specific instances and prohibiting the prosecutor from plea bargaining. On review, the court rejected defendant's argument and held that the plain language of the challenged statutes continued to give a prosecutor discretion as to when to file special allegations. Despite the use of the words &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;when&quot; or &quot;whenever &quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.836, &sect; 9.94A.837, and former &sect; 9.94A.835, the prosecutor retained discretion to file or not file special allegations. Under the statutes, the prosecutor was to evaluate the admissibility of evidence and determine the strength of that evidence for obtaining a finding on a special allegation. Thus, the three challenged statutes did not unconstitutionally limit prosecutorial discretion or mandate the filing of special allegations regardless of the individual circumstances of a case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury for the King County Superior Court (Washington) found defendant guilty of assault in the third degree for intentionally assaulting a law enforcement officer who was performing official duties at the time of the assault under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.031(1)(g). The jury found that defendant committed the crime shortly after being released from incarceration. The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence of 36 months. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two police officers testified that defendant looked toward them as the officers approached him from behind. There was evidence that defendant was holding a pair of medical scissors in his fist, with the point aimed downward. In addition, defendant repeatedly stabbed one of the police officer's leg, causing the officer to sustain three wounds. Furthermore, testimony revealed that defendant attempted to conceal the weapon after hurting the officer and that defendant was aggressive even after being arrested. A jury could reasonably infer from that evidence that defendant was aware that two men were approaching him, that he was holding the medical scissors as a weapon, and that the stabbings were intentional. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict finding defendant guilty of assault in the third degree. Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9.94A.535(3)(t), 9A.20.021(c), and 9.94A.537, because the jury found the aggravating factor of rapid recidivism beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial court was authorized to sentence defendant to a term of confinement up to the maximum allowed for his underlying conviction of assault in the third degree, which was 60 months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The new legislation did not violate the ex post facto provisions of the U.S. and Washington Constitutions. Retroactive application of the legislation did not infringe on vested development rights. The new legislation did not render existing local plans noncompliant with the Washington Growth Management Act. The county's CAO satisfied the best available science standard. There was substantial evidence in the record supporting the shoreline buffers required by the CAO. The county did not engage in an unconstitutional taking. The county satisfied the nexus and rough proportionality constitutional tests for the shoreline buffers.</SPAN></P>

The company argued that the statute governing the relevant deduction, former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.04.433 (1985), unambiguously entitled a manufacturer that also sold certain products to take a deduction against its business and occupation tax liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court entered an order granting summary judgment to the State of Washington, Department of Revenue, finding that former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.04.433 extended only to retailing and wholesaling business and occupation (B&amp;O) taxes, not to manufacturing B&amp;O taxes, and that the company was not entitled to a refund. The appellate court found that the plain language of the statute showed: (1) a deduction was intended; (2) the deduction applied, at the very least, against all Wash. Rev. Code ch. 82.04 B&amp;O taxes; (3) the deduction was for an amount derived from or taken as a result of qualifying sales to vessels used primarily in foreign commerce; and (4) in order to take the deduction, a seller must have complied with the certificate requirements in Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 458-20-175 (Rule 175). It was undisputed that the company engaged in sales of fuel for consumption outside the territorial waters of the United States, by vessels used primarily in foreign commerce as required under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.04.433(1). The company paid $ 6,679,864 in B&amp;O taxes directly related to those sales and fully complied with the Rule 175 certificate requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a bench trial on stipulated facts, the Grays Harbor County Superior Court (Washington) found defendant guilty of unlawful possession of methamphetamine, contrary to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.4013(1). Defendant appealed his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because the Washington Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 69.50, did not permit an arrest for mere possession of drug paraphernalia, defendant contended that his arrest was unlawful. However, a police officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for driving while under the influence of a controlled substance, in violation of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.502. Accordingly, his arrest was lawful. Furthermore, the officer could seize evidence of that crime he found in open view, including a bong made out of an orange juice container. Also, defendant did not challenge the scope of the search incident to his arrest. Because defendant did not challenge the scope of the search of his vehicle, the State did not present alternative theories that could have justified the search and the trial court did not create a record sufficient for the appellate court's review. Accordingly, pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.6(a), Wash. R. Evid. 103(a), and Wash. R. App. P. 2.5(a), the appellate court held that defendant failed to preserve an objection to the scope of the officer's search of his vehicle incident to his lawful arrest for appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury of the King County Superior Court, Washington, found defendant guilty of two counts of assault in the second degree. By special verdicts, the jury found that defendant was armed with a deadly weapon on each count. On count 2, the trial court considered a good Samaritan aggravator in deciding to sentence defendant to 38 months, which was at the high end of the standard range. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A third party tried to break up a bar fight between defendant and another bar patron. Defendant stabbed the third party in the abdomen. Neither the original nor the amended information alleged the existence of an aggravating circumstance. Defendant argued that since his constitutional right to notice of the good Samaritan aggravator was violated, he was entitled to reversal of the conviction on count 2. The State argued that an aggravating circumstance did not have to be included in the information. The court concluded that defendant was entitled to the usual remedy for a deficient information: dismissal of the underlying criminal charge, without prejudice to the State's ability to refile. Defendant was exposed to the possibility the judge would exercise the authority given by the verdict to impose a greater punishment than the information contemplated. Functionally, the good Samaritan aggravator operated as an essential element of an aggravated version of assault, which the State had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt. The State's failure to plead the good Samaritan aggravator in the information functionally undermined the jury's verdict on count 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The second degree assault conviction on count 2 involving the good Samaritan aggravator was reversed and dismissed, without prejudice to the State's right to recharge that count.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, an animal rights organization and one of its members, sued defendants, the State of Washington and King County, contending that portions of the State's animal cruelty law, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 16.52, were unconstitutional. The King County Superior Court, Washington, granted defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings and denied plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint a second time. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The challenged provisions of the statute established that persons engaging in particular activities and practices were not committing criminal animal cruelty. The relief sought by plaintiffs was to have the various sections excluding these practices from condemnation as criminal stricken, thus - by judicial fiat - criminalizing these practices and activities. The court concluded that this case did not present a justiciable controversy, and that the trial court did not err by ordering dismissal. Plaintiffs failed to join indispensable parties. Specifically, plaintiffs failed to join any of those parties whose rights and interests would have been affected by the declaratory relief that plaintiffs sought, including beef ranchers, rodeo riders, 4-H members, veterinarians, recreational fishermen, and university researchers. In addition, plaintiffs presented a political question not appropriate for the judiciary to resolve. The trial court did not err by denying plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint a second time. The additional allegations contained in plaintiffs' second amended complaint would not have cured the justiciability defects. Thus, the proposed amendment was futile.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant auction company challenged respondent Washington Department of Revenue's instruction to pay excise tax on farm equipment sold at its future auctions. The Franklin County Superior Court, Washington, dismissed the company's appeal, reasoning it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal because no taxes had been improperly paid to trigger its jurisdiction. The company appealed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that trial court did not err in dismissing the auction company's appeal based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Based on the clear statutory language of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 82.32.150 and 82.03.180, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the company's complaint until an auction sale occurred and the excise tax was paid. Applying the APA to afford review of prospective reporting instructions, without payment of a tax, would directly conflict with &sect; 82.32.150 by allowing review of an excise tax dispute in superior court without payment of the tax in full. Because &sect; 82.32.180 provided de novo review, the company could not alternatively obtain review under the Washington Administrative Procedures Act's judicial review procedures. Although the company contended &sect; 82.32.180 was unconstitutional, this issue was not listed in the company's assignments of error or listed as an issue at the beginning of its brief. The company did not claim that the trial court committed a manifest error affecting a constitutional right. Accordingly, this issue was not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After petitioner pled guilty to a drug offense and other offenses, the trial court imposed DOSA sentences pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.660. After petitioner completed the in-custody portion of his sentences, the DOC released him into community custody, a condition of which required petitioner to obey all laws. On review petitioner's personal restraint petition seeking to enjoin enforcement of the revocation order, the court rejected petitioner's argument that the DOC relied upon impermissible hearsay evidence contained in police reports. Rather, the record demonstrated that the finding of a DOSA violation was based primarily upon the testimony of defendant's girlfriend, who testified in person at the proceedings. Because petitioner called his girlfriend as a witness, he clearly had an opportunity to confront her about her version of events. Further, under the plain language of the DOSA statutes in effect at the time at issue, former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.660(3)(a) and former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.737(1), the DOC had authority to hold a violation hearing and revoke the community custody portion of petitioner's DOSA sentences.</SPAN></P>

On review of defendant's conviction, the court held that the jury instructions were not insufficient. Rather, the jury instructions followed the statute at issue and correctly informed the jury of the applicable law, including the rule that a mental state is established by proof of a more serious mental state. The instructions made clear that a different mental state must be determined for each element: intent as to assault and recklessness as to infliction of substantial bodily harm. The instructions thus clearly required two separate inquiries, and nothing in the knowledge instruction suggested otherwise.</SPAN></P>

A Washington Pollution Control Hearings Board fully affirmed the DOE's decision. The Thurston Superior Court (Washington) affirmed the Board's order in full and denied its due process and vagueness challenges.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.48.035 authorized and required the DOE to issue regulations it determined were necessary to protect the quality of &quot;waters of the state.&quot; Accordingly, the DOE issued regulations that reflected its determination that wetlands contained &quot;surface water or ground water,&quot; which brought the wetlands within the definition of &quot;surface waters of the state.&quot; Thus, the wetlands had to be protected under the Washington Water Pollution Control Act (WPCA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 90.48. Because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.48.020 included &quot;all other surface waters&quot; in its definition of &quot;waters of the state,&quot; the WPCA's application to the wetlands was not unconstitutionally vague. Further, the definition of &quot;pollution&quot; in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 90.48.020 of the WPCA was not vague as applied to appellant's placement of fill material into the wetlands at its worksite because appellant altered the physical properties of the wetlands where the vegetation, which was essential for the wetlands' water quality and hydrologic functions, that existed before appellant placed the fill on the site was destroyed and the fill material compressed the soil beneath it by a minimum of two feet.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner filed a personal restraint petition, alleging that he was entitled to a total of 34 days of credit against the unexpired term of his prison sentence. The acting chief judge dismissed the petition in part and referred two issues to the court. During the pendency of this proceeding, the Washington Department of Corrections (DOC) released petitioner from confinement after he completed serving his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner argued that he was unlawfully restrained because DOC failed to give him credit for time he spent in detention awaiting disposition hearings for alleged violations of conditions of community custody. Because petitioner was released from confinement while his personal restraint petition was still pending, the petition was technically moot. But the court agreed with the parties that it should review the claim on the merits because it was of continuing and substantial public interest. The court held that petitioner was entitled to credit on the remaining portion of his sentence for all periods he actually spent in detention awaiting disposition of alleged violations of conditions of community custody. This result was dictated by former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.737 (2002), the statute in effect at the time petitioner committed the crimes for which he was sentenced. Although DOC gave petitioner credit against his remaining sentence for the time spent in community custody, it failed to give him credit for the time he spent in detention awaiting his first two disposition hearings. This was contrary to the plain language of former &sect; 9.94A.737(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the petition as technically moot, but held that petitioner's statutory claim was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent Washington Department of Early Learning summarily suspended and then revoked appellant licensee's child care center license. An administrative law judge upheld the revocation, but found that Department had acted prematurely in suspending the license. A review judge affirmed the revocation and reinstated the summary suspension. The King County Superior Court, Washington, affirmed the review judge's decision. The licensee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The licensee contended the proper standard of proof in adjudicative proceedings regarding the suspension or revocation of a license is clear and convincing evidence. However, the court concluded that the legislative mandate for proof by a preponderance of the evidence set forth in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.215.300(2) reflects a constitutionally permissible allocation of the risk of error. The license was issued with the qualification that the licensee's interest in it was subordinate to the State's responsibility for protecting children. If the standard of proof were raised, children would be exposed to a greater risk of receiving inadequate care. That result would be unsatisfactory in light of the legislative policy to the contrary. The licensee did not carry the heavy burden of establishing beyond question that &sect; 43.215.300(2) is unconstitutional. The Department had adequate proof to justify a summary suspension. Because a compliance agreement specifically reserved the Department's right to take other licensing action for failure to meet licensing requirements, the agreement did not require the Department to give the licensee more time to correct deficiencies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While appellant was still in total confinement, the State sought to commit him as a sexually violent predator (SVP) under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.09. The Lewis County Superior Court (Washington) denied his requests to withdraw his express waiver of a jury trial and to have the case heard by a jury. The trial court found beyond a reasonable doubt that he was an SVP and ordered that he be involuntarily committed for treatment. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted in California of two counts of lewd and lascivious acts upon a child under 14 and one count of oral copulation. He was also convicted of two counts of statutory rape in the first degree in Washington. The trial judge established by colloquy, on the record, that appellant expressly waived his right to a trial by jury when the State withdrew its demand, a waiver he expressly acknowledged and did not challenge on appeal. However, on the first morning of the scheduled trial, appellant asked the trial court to set his case for a jury trial. The sole reason for the request was that he changed his mind during the six days following his express waiver of his jury trial right. Granting the request on the morning of trial would have prejudiced the State, delayed the trial, and inconvenienced the State's primary witness. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's request for a jury on the first morning of trial. Further, appellant's two state convictions for statutory rape necessarily were for crimes of sexual violence under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(17). Thus, he was a sexually violent predator under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.020(18).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury of the King County Superior Court, Washington, found that defendant met the criteria for a sexually violent predator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.060(1), contending that by preventing him from presenting evidence that a community protection program was an available placement option for him upon release, the statute prohibited him from rebutting the State's evidence that he was likely to reoffend if not committed. The court concluded that defendant lacked standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality. At most, a letter relied upon by defendant only indicated that he was a potential candidate for the program and directed him to follow up with his case manager if he was interested in the program. Defendant pointed to nothing else in the record establishing that he had in fact been through the application process, had been accepted as a suitable candidate for the program, and had agreed to participate in the program. Without further information about his actual placement in the program, defendant failed to establish that the program was an option that in fact would exist for him upon his release. Thus, even if evidence of the program were admissible under the statute, defendant failed to show that it would be admissible in his case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant parents sought review of an order from the Kitsap County Superior Court (Washington), which terminated their parental rights to their two children pursuant to a petition filed by respondent, the Washington Department of Social and Health Services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court terminated the parents' rights to their two children. The children qualified as &quot;Indian children&quot; under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1901- 1963. On appeal, the court concluded that 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1912(a) and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.070(10) (2004) required the Department to notify the Cherokee and Black Foot tribes of the termination proceedings. However, the Department failed to do so. An Indian Child Welfare (ICW) case manager was a qualified expert witness because she was a tribal member and was explicitly designated as an expert qualified in the placement of tribal children in state proceedings. Substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the parents' continued custody of the children would result in serious emotional or physical damage to them such that termination was in their best interest under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.34.190(2). The father failed to address his parental deficiencies, which included untreated substance abuse, untreated mental health issues, domestic violence, and an inability to live independently. The mother, even after receiving extensive counseling and parenting services, could not safely parent the children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the termination orders. The court remanded the case for proper notice of the termination proceedings to the Cherokee and Black Foot tribes. If the notified tribes declined to intervene, the termination orders would stand. If either of the tribes chose to intervene, the trial court would hold further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a union and two corrections employees, appealed the dismissal of their petition challenging respondent Washington Human Rights Commission's opinion letter to the Washington Department of Corrections. The Thurston County Superior Court, Washington, ruled that the opinion letter was not an &quot;agency action&quot; giving rise to a justiciable cause of action for judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission's opinion letter concerned bona fide gender-based occupational qualifications at a women's correctional facility. Appellants argued that the opinion letter constituted a justiciable agency action, not a mere interpretive statement. The court disagreed. Appellants did not meet the justiciable controversy test in its challenge to the opinion letter because (1) the opinion letter addressed only academic or hypothetical application of the law and, therefore, did not meet the third requirement for a justiciable controversy; and (2) under the Washington Administrative Procedure Act (APA), it was clear that the opinion letter was an advisory interpretative statement, which did not give rise to a justiciable controversy when challenged. Because the opinion letter was an interpretive statement under the APA, it explicitly constituted an opinion of the Commission and could not serve as the basis for a justiciable action. Accordingly, appellants' petition was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of dismissal was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The Spokane Superior Court (Washington) affirmed the Board's decision. The teacher appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher sent an email from a college computer that encouraged recipients to urge state legislators to approve bills that would provide tenure-like protections for certain teachers. The Board found that the teacher violated statutes and an administrative rule by using her state resources for lobbying. The trial court affirmed the Board's order and the court affirmed as well. Although the teacher argued that her email did not result in private benefit or gain for herself or others, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.52.160(1) did not require such, but only required that the email be sent for that purpose. The Board did not err in finding that the teacher violated the statute. The teacher's conduct constituted lobbying, for purposes of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.190 and former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 42.17.020(27), as she admitted she was trying to influence the passage of two bills by encouraging others to contact their legislators. The court agreed that it could not consider the constitutionality of the enforcement of the employer's policy because the Board's consideration was limited, but the court also determined the argument was unpersuasive on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) that convcited him of unlawful possession of a firearm, gross misdemeanor harassment, resisting arrest, and obstructing a law enforcement officer, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his gross misdemeanor harassment conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer effected a traffic stop and subsequently placed the driver under arrest. Defendant, a passenger in the vehicle, attempted to flee the scene. He was apprehended and, after a struggle with the police officer, was placed in handcuffs and seated in the patrol car. While in the back seat of the patrol car, defendant threatened to &quot;kick [the officer's] ass.&quot; His threats earned him a charge of gross misdemeanor harassment in addition to the offenses for which he was arrested. On review, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's harassment conviction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.020(1) because the officer took defendant's threats seriously in light of the fact that he had previously been assaulted by handcuffed individuals. The officer testified that a person in handcuffs could assault an officer without using his hands; such a person could, for example, kick or bite or headbutt the arresting officer. Defendant's threat, as well as his belligerent and assaultive conduct before and during his arrest, allowed the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer's concern for his safety was reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employee challenged an order from the Pierce County Superior Court (Washington), which dismissed her claims against respondents, a church and its pastor, for negligent infliction of emotional distress, wrongful discharge, retaliation, harassment, negligent supervision and retention, violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e-2(a)(1), and violation of the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee believed that tours of religious and historical sites led by the pastor possibly jeopardized the church's tax exempt status. After she was terminated, she brought an action against respondents. The trial court dismissed the claims. On appeal, the court found that because inquiries into &quot;the mind of the church&quot; created an unconstitutional government entanglement with the church, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in foreclosing inquiry into the church investigative committee's thought processes during discovery. Further, an employment decision by the church session committee recommending the employee's termination based on an evaluation of her actions did not give rise to a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim against the church. However, the trial court erred in dismissing the employee's claims for the pastor's negligent infliction of emotional distress based on his abusive behavior toward her. The ecclesiastical abstention doctrine did not bar such a claim against him. Finally, the plain language in WLAD's religious employer exemption, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.040(11), barred the employee's harassment and wrongful discharge claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's discovery rulings and the dismissal of the claims against the church for negligent infliction of emotional distress, wrongful discharge, retaliation, and violation of WLAD. The court reversed the dismissal of the negligent infliction of emotional distress claim against the pastor. The court reversed the dismissal of the Title VII claims against the church. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
