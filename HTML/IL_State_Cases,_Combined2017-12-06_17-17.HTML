XIII, &sect; 5 did not present an obstacle to a contractual provision that permitted subsequent modification of public retirement benefits; [4]-Plaintiff's promissory estoppel claim failed, because it sought to enforce a contractual obligation that went beyond the terms of the 2004 CBA.</SPAN></P>

Sup. Ct. R. 604(a)'s provision granting the State the right to appeal suppression orders was not made applicable to juvenile cases through Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 660(a), and a suspension order entered in a juvenile case was not appealable under Rule 604(a); [4]-Juveniles placed under court suspension were not similarly situated to adult criminal defendants placed under suspension, and defendant could not make even the threshold showing necessary to establish an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 2 was not moot, but 820 ILCS 185/10 was not vague, because that section provided a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct the Act prohibited and did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement; [3]-Plaintiffs forfeited their other claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The right to an abortion in Illinois law was not grounded in the Privacy Clause, Ill. Const. art. I. &sect; 6. Rather, a state constitutional right to abortion derived from Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, which was interpreted equivalent to the due process protections of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Act did not violate the right to privacy where the intrusion into a minor's privacy was not unreasonable given that it required the minor to give notice to only one legally responsible adult and provided for an exception to the notice requirement when a medical emergency existed. Thus, the Act was narrowly crafted to achieve its aim of promoting the minors' best interests through parental consultation. The Act did not violate Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, given that parental notification served compelling state interests. The Act also did not violate Ill. Const. art. I. &sect; 18, as the Act did not create a sex-based classification.</SPAN></P>

The Supreme Court of Illinois held that the statutory requirement to hold a hearing within 60 days of the filing of an EJJ motion was directory; therefore, the trial court's failure to hold a hearing within 60 days did not void the stayed adult sentence. Because respondent received notice of the EJJ motion filing and a hearing on the motion in accordance with 705 ILCS 405/5-810(2), his rights were not prejudiced. Finally, the EJJ statute did not violate due process under Apprendi. There was nothing in the EJJ statute that allowed a juvenile to be sentenced above the statutory maximum based on factors not proven to a trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a pretrial motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence, and argued that the underlying search, prompted by the officers seeing a plastic bag in the center console of his vehicle that contained a bullet sticking up inside it, was unreasonable in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and that he was subjected to an unlawful arrest without probable cause. The trial court granted his motion to suppress all evidence recovered, which consisted of additional bullets and a handgun. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court disagreed with both the trial and appellate courts. It found that after the officers saw the bullet in plain view, they had a reasonable concern for their own safety and could conduct the protective searches that occurred, even without probable cause.

In Atwater, the United States Supreme Court held that an arrest for a minor, fine-only offense was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court held that under the limited lockstep doctrine, it construed Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 the same way because defendant failed to show that any of the narrow exceptions to lockstep interpretation applied. Illinois had no common law or statutory tradition of prohibiting arrests for minor offenses. The court held that defendant forfeited his claim that the appellate court erred by remanding the case for a hearing on his ability to pay a public defender fee by failing to raise it in his petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to a term of 23 years in prison, which included a 15-year enhancement under 720 ILCS 5/18-2(b) (2008). On appeal, the appellate court found that the trial court erred by applying the 15-year enhancement upon rejecting the State's claim a Public Act had revived the sentencing enhancement in the armed robbery statute by amending the armed violence statute. It remanded for a resentencing that did not include the enhancement. The state supreme court found that the legislature's enactment of 2007 Ill. Laws 95-688 after the state supreme court found the enhancement unconstitutional in Hauschild was an amendment to the comparison statute, the armed violence statute, and had the effect of reviving the firearm enhancement for armed robbery with a firearm because it eliminated any issue regarding identical offense elements. In so holding, it rejected defendant's claim that no revival had occurred, as it found the amendment had not made the enhancement statute void ab initio, which a reviewing court could not do, but, rather, unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court properly remanded for a new trial because he was statutorily entitled to appointment of counsel, i.e., once defendant decided not to participate in his trial by refusing to leave his holding cell, the circuit court had no choice, pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/115-4.1, but to appoint counsel before proceeding with the trial. The supreme court disagreed and held that 725 ILCS 5/115-4.1 was inapplicable to in-custody defendants. Accordingly, the trial court was not statutorily required to appoint a third public defender and continue the trial date simply because defendant, after waiving his right to counsel, decided to waive also his right to be present by refusing to leave his holding cell. In other words, express statutory authority was not a prerequisite to trial in absentia. Defendant made no constitutionally based argument that required appointment of counsel in the face of a valid waiver of that right. Instead, defendant's claim of error was based entirely on 725 ILCS 5/115-4.1, which was inapplicable under the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the question to be resolved was one concerning proof of the elements of the offense and not, as the circuit court found, a question of constitutionality of the statute defining the offense. The supreme court found that the State may rebut defendant's evidence that he possessed a valid license with evidence that his license was not valid because he purposely misled the authorities to prevent them from properly determining that his driving privileges had not been otherwise suspended, revoked, or cancelled. In a trial for a violation of 625 ILCS 5/6-303, the case law and statutory scheme for restoring suspended and revoked licenses allowed for a determination by the trier of fact as to whether the defendant misled authorities into reinstating his privilege to drive by providing erroneous information through either purposeful concealment or incorrect representation.

He conceded that the basis on which he sought to invalidate his murder conviction, the independent felonious purpose analysis, was not supported by precedent at the time of his direct appeal.

The supreme court agreed with the appellate court that the taxpayers' allegations failed to establish that their alleged injury was a direct result of the enforcement of the education funding statute or was fairly traceable to defendants', State Board of Education officials and Governor, actions. The school districts and not defendants controlled the amount of local property taxes imposed. The taxpayers' claims that the imposition of the higher taxes as a direct result of the enforcement of the statute and was fairly traceable to defendants was too attenuated to confer standing. The education funding statute did not require or compel school districts to tax at a certain rate, nor did it require school districts to reach the Foundation Level in order to receive the general state aid to which they were statutorily entitled. The taxpayers' alleged injury was not a direct result of the enforcement of the education funding statute, or fairly traceable to defendants' actions in enacting the statute.</SPAN></P>

The Election Board ruled that she was not disqualified and denied the objection to her nomination papers. The trial court upheld the Election Board's decision, but the appellate court reversed, set aside the Election Board's decision, and ordered that if her name could not be removed from the ballot, any votes cast for her would not be counted. The state supreme court found that the controversy was moot because the election had already occurred, but determined that the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine applied because public officials needed guidance on the matter. It then found that she could not be disqualified under the Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/3.1-10-5(b) (2010), for being in arrears in the payment of a tax or other indebtedness due to a municipality since the tax she owed was owed to the county, rather than a municipality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Appellate Court, in a product liability action, held: (1) a trial court had discretion to dismiss plaintiff injured man's cause of action with prejudice as a sanction for filing a complaint with a fictitious name and without leave of court and (2) it had to dismiss his cause of action with prejudice because his amended complaint did not relate back to the initial filing. The state supreme court granted his request to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured man was badly hurt while using a punch press for the employer. He timely filed a product liability complaint against defendant manufacturers, who had made press parts. The complaint identified him by a first and last name he commonly used. Later, in a deposition, he stated his real first and last name. The trial court denied the manufacturers' motion to dismiss attacking use of the fictitious name, and the filing of his second amended complaint using his real name on the ground that it did not relate back to the timely filed complaint. The trial court then certified the question of whether he could be sanctioned for filing using a fictitious name without leave of court pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-401(e) (2008) and whether the second amended complaint could relate back under 735 ILCS 5/2-616(b) (2008). The appellate court answered affirmatively to the first issue, with qualifications, and affirmatively as to the second issue. The state supreme court found as to the first issue, dismissal was within the trial court's discretion. It found as to the second issue that the original complaint was not per se a nullity and the second amended complaint could relate back.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed that part of the appellate court's judgment that held the trial court had to dismiss an injured plaintiff's product liability action with prejudice under the relation back doctrine. Otherwise, it ordered that the trial court's judgment be vacated and the case be remanded to the trial court to conduct a new hearing to determine whether dismissal as a sanction was required under the standards it set forth.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality of that statute as applied to him, especially since the 17-year-old victim pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/12-16(d) (2008) could legally consent to the sex act itself, but he was prosecuted for recording it with a cell phone camera. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that his due process rights under the United States and Illinois constitutions was not violated because the Illinois legislature rationally could have determined that it needed to protect 17-year-old victims from consenting to the memorialization of sex acts even if it did not need to protect 17-year-olds from engaging in the sex acts themselves. It also found, as to his equal protection challenge, that since no fundamental right nor suspect class was involved, rational basis review allowed the convictions to be upheld because the statutes were rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, and were neither arbitrary nor discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in 2006. Each offense was a Class X felony, which carried a sentence of 6 to 30 years' imprisonment, plus a 15-year sentencing enhancement for use of a firearm. Thus, the sentencing range was 21 to 45 years. The trial court sentenced defendant to a term of 25 years' imprisonment for each offense, to be served concurrently. The appellate court held that because defendant was sentenced under a statute which violated the proportionate penalties clause, the matter must be remanded for resentencing, and on remand defendant would be subject to a term of 6 to 30 years' imprisonment for his armed robbery conviction, rather than a term of 21 to 45 years' imprisonment. The State argued that the Hauschild decision should be overruled because it misconstrued the armed violence statute and misapplied the identical elements test. The reviewing court held that Hauschild remained the law as to the meaning of the armed violence statute prior to its amendment by 2007 Ill. Laws 95-688.</SPAN></P>

Eventually, defendant filed two pro se postconviction relief petitions that were both denied. The trial court then denied his requests to file his third and fourth pro se postconviction petitions.

The state supreme court found that showing cause and prejudice before obtaining leave to file a successive postconviction petition, under 725 ILCS 5/122-1(f) (2006), could be relaxes where actual innocence was alleged.

The state supreme court granted their petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challengers filed a preenforcement action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the county and defendant county officials that challenged the constitutionality of a county ordinance known as the Blair Holt Assault Weapons Ban. They claimed, inter alia, that it violated due process on vagueness grounds, as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and the Second Amendment right to bear arms. The trial court dismissed the first amended complaint, pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (2006), upon finding that the challengers failed to state a cause of action. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court agreed with the trial and appellate courts about the dismissal of the due process and equal protection claims after it found that vagueness did not permeate the law's text, its prohibitions were clearly defined, and the ordinance did not arbitrarily differentiate between two owners with similar firearms. However, it did find that dismissal as to the Second Amendment claim was improper because it was not clear that assault weapons ran afoul of it, and the county also needed an opportunity to present evidence in favor of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The State claimed the appellate court erred when it relied on People v. Ross to reverse the convictions. The supreme court agreed. Given the victim's unequivocal testimony and the circumstances under which he was able to view a gun, the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant possessed a real gun. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, the jurors, as the triers of fact, could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was armed with a dangerous weapon when he committed the offenses of kidnapping, vehicular hijacking and robbery. Defendant claimed the allegations in his indictment varied from the State's proof at trial with regard to the type of dangerous weapon used. However, because the indictment charged him with committing the offenses while armed with a dangerous weapon, &quot;to wit: a firearm,&quot; defendant was fully apprised of the charges lodged against him. There was no variance, fatal or otherwise, between the indictment and the proof at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed a summary judgment grant for defendant school district regarding payment of cancellation fees after defendant Authority took over management of its finances and prematurely cancelled lease agreements with plaintiff lessor. It vacated as moot a declaratory judgment issue about whether cancellation had to be according to the contracts' terms. The state supreme court granted the lessor's petition for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district leased portable classrooms from the lessor. The relevant contracts included monetary penalties for early cancellation. Ultimately, the state invoked the Downstate School Finance Authority for Elementary Districts Law, 105 ILCS 5/1F-1 et seq. (2004) (Act), to create the school district finance authority (Authority) to manage the school district's finances. Thereafter, the Authority prematurely canceled the leases. The lessor sued the school district and Authority seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act permitted the Authority to cancel the leases only in a way consistent with the contractual language, including the cancellation provisions. The lessor also sought a judgment against the school district for the cancellation fees. The trial court granted summary judgment to the school district as to the fees. It also entered the declaratory judgment the lessor sought. The appellate court affirmed as to the fees and vacated as moot the declaratory judgment issue. The state supreme court found the Act permitted the Authority to cancel the school district's contract with a third party, but that the cancellation had to be according to the contractual agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed the appellate court's judgment. It also affirmed the trial court's declaratory judgment in favor of the lessor and reversed the trial court's judgment in favor of the school district on the lessor's count three action for breach of the lease agreements. The state supreme court also remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a high school basketball coach, challenged a judgment from the appellate court (Illinois), which affirmed the circuit court's dismissal pursuant to the Citizen Participation Act, 735 ILCS 110/1 et seq. (2008), of defamation and other tort claims against defendants, individuals who had petitioned the school board to remove the coach and local media that had published their criticisms. The circuit court awarded statutory attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition to remove the coach asserted that he had been abusive toward players. The school board considered the petition and initially voted to retain the coach, but it removed him after further criticisms were published in the local media. The court noted that the motions to dismiss should have been filed under 735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (2008), rather than 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (2008), and treated them as if they had been so filed. After considering the public policy expressed in 735 ILCS 110/5 (2008), the court concluded that the coach's lawsuit was not a SLAPP under the definitions in 735 ILCS 110/10 (2008), 110/15 (2008) because the lawsuit was not solely based on, related to, or in response to acts in furtherance of the rights of petition and speech. The coach sought to recover damages for personal harm to his reputation, not to stifle political expression. Thus, the burden of proof never shifted to the coach under 735 ILCS 110/20(c) (2008). Although that ruling made the attorney fees issue moot, the court addressed the issue under the public interest exception and interpreted 735 ILCS 110/25 (2008) to include only those fees specifically incurred in connection with the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the appellate court and the circuit court. The court remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An Illinois trial court dismissed three forfeiture complaints with prejudice that the State had filed against appellees after finding that the statutory forfeiture provisions, 720 ILCS 5/36-1 through 36-4 (2006), were facially unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the vehicle-forfeiture provisions of 720 ILCS 5/36-1 through 36-4 (2006) were not facially unconstitutional as a violation of procedural due process under the Fifth and 14th Amendments and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, even though they did not include a provision requiring a prompt, probable cause hearing after the seizure of a vehicle, because the forfeiture proceeding itself provided all the process that was due. Applying the Baker factors pursuant to United States Supreme Court precedent, the court found that: (1) the State filed its complaints for forfeiture within 22, 20, and 20 days of each of the seizures pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/36-2(a) (2006); (2) it did not appear that the claimants took any steps to obtain an early return of their vehicles but rather filed several motions for continuances before waiting several months to file a motion to dismiss; and (3) the claimants did not allege any undue delay, let alone prejudice from the delay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One Illinois Appellate Court rejected defendant's argument that probation officers lacked the power to file petitions alleging a probation violation and seeking probation revocation. A second Illinois Appellate Court rejected the State's claim that 730 ILCS 5/5-6-4(i) (2006) unduly infringed on the executive branch or, more specifically, the State's Attorneys in prosecuting probation violations. Defendant and the State, respectively, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In one case, defendant's probation officer indicated to the trial court that defendant was violating his probation. Defendant unsuccessfully claimed on appeal that only the State's Attorney had the power to seek probation revocation. In a second, separate case, the trial court could impose intermediate sanctions in lieu of revoking probation, and though each of three defendants accepted and completed a program of intermediate sanctions, the State's Attorney nevertheless sought probation revocation. The three defendants successfully sought dismissal of the revocation petitions. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court consolidated the appeals. It then found that probation officers, pursuant to 730 ILCS 5/5-6-4(i) (2006), had the power to file petitions alleging violations of probation with the trial court, as occurred regarding defendant in the first case. It also found that the State's Attorney could not veto a probation officer's offer of intermediate sanctions, as long as the sanctions were timely completed, and such a finding did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because the ultimate authority regarding probation violations was in the judicial branch.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court granted defendant's petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial, he moved in limine to prohibit the State from introducing evidence regarding his juvenile adjudication for burglary, which had occurred less than a year before the shooting. The trial court denied the motion in limine, and the State referred to the adjudication at least twice in closing argument. Defendant was convicted of both charges. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that the main issue before it was whether reversible error occurred when the State was allowed to impeach defendant, who testified at trial, with his prior juvenile adjudication for burglary. The state supreme court found that: (1) pursuant to 705 ILCS 405/5-150(1)(c) (2006), a juvenile adjudication was typically not admissible against a testifying defendant; (2) defendant did not &quot;open the door&quot; to the admission of such evidence; and (3) the error in admitting it was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motor vehicle dealer filed a complaint against defendants, truck manufacturers and a chief executive officer, alleging violations of the Motor Vehicle Franchise Act (the Act), 815 ILCS 710/1 et seq. (2010), and claims of breach of contract, tortious interference with contract, and fraud. The circuit court dismissed all but two counts with prejudice. The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court properly held that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear several counts and portions of counts brought under &sect; 4(d)(6) of the Act, 815 ILCS 710/4(d)(6), because those counts should have been brought before the Motor Vehicle Review Board (MVRB). The circuit court was not authorized to determine good cause in conjunction with &sect; 4(d)(6) because good cause determinations under &sect; 4(d)(6) had to be made by the MVRB. The legislature intended to deprive the circuit courts of jurisdiction to make good cause determinations and thus no concurrent jurisdiction existed. Accordingly, primary jurisdiction was not applicable. Without concurrent or original jurisdiction, there was no primary jurisdiction. The case could not have been brought originally in the circuit court and then referred out by that court because that court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter in the first place. The two-step process of first obtaining a good cause finding from the MVRB and then seeking damages from the circuit court did not run afoul of the doctrine of res judicata because the MVRB was not empowered to award damages.</SPAN></P>

The condemnees did not forfeit their right to have just compensation valued using a point in time other than the date of the filing of the action in accordance with 735 ILCS 5/7-121 (1998) because they raised the constitutionality of the statute as applied at the hearing on the Kirby motion one month before trial. As to the merits of the argument, a taking did not occur until, at the very earliest, the date the government deposited the condemnation award and was given the right to take title and possession. Also, the appellate court properly determined that the condemnnees were not required to file a demand for a speedy trial, and that the condemnor still had the option to abandon the proceeding if it chose to do so.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Appellate Court held that the removal of funds from the Cycle Rider Safety Training Fund (CRSTF) was not an unconstitutional taking, and that the legislature had the authority to order a transfer of funds out of the CRSTF and into the General Revenue Fund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature amended the Cycle Rider Safety Training Act, 625 ILCS 35/1 et seq. (1994), to change the Cycle Rider Safety Training Fund (CRSTF) from a special fund inside the state treasury to a &quot;trust fund outside of the State treasury,&quot; as set forth in 625 ILCS 35/6 (1994). The legislature also authorized the transfer of money from that fund into the State's General Revenue Fund, through budget implementation acts and State Finance Act amendments. Eventually, the objectors sued to challenge transfers made from the CRSTF and into the General Revenue Fund. Primarily, they alleged that such conduct by defendant state officials was an unconstitutional taking of private property. The trial court disagreed and granted summary judgment to the state officials. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that the amendment changing the CRSTF did not make what were public funds private funds. It also found the legislature could not create an irrevocable trust with the public funds because it did not have the authority to bind subsequent legislatures, and that transferring the funds involved permissibly removing property in one trust and placing it in another state fund.</SPAN></P>

The trial court presided over an evidentiary hearing in the matter. The case itself was tried before a different judge. The husband was found not guilty. The husband soon filed a petition to divorce his wife. Eventually, the cause was assigned to the same trial judge who had ruled on the admissibility of evidence in the domestic battery case. The trial court noted that the parties had been before him in the domestic battery case, but neither party objected. Later on, the husband requested a substitution of judge pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-1001(a)(3) (2006) and cited supporting reasons. Another judge heard the request and found no proof that the trial court was prejudiced against the husband. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that the husband had not shown the actual prejudice required under 735 ILCS 5/2-1001 (2006) to obtain a substitution for cause and rejected the husband's assertion that the standard was &quot;appearance of impropriety&quot; under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 63. On another issue raised, it found that the award of maintenance to the wife was within the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, petitioner on behalf of all taxpayers, challenged the judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court, finding that 2009 Ill. Laws 34 violated the single subject clause of Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8(d), and that 2009 Ill. Laws 35, 37 and 39 were invalid based on language making their enactment contingent on the enactment of 2009 Ill. Laws 34.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the four Public Acts violated various provisions of the Illinois Constitution, and the circuit court denied the plaintiffs' petition. The appellate court reversed, finding that 2009 Ill. Laws 34 violated the single subject clause of the Illinois Constitution, because the provisions did not have a natural and logical connection to the single subject of revenue. The appellate court also held that 2009 Ill. Laws 35, 37 and 38 could not stand because they were expressly contingent on the enactment of 2009 Ill. Laws 34. The reviewing court held that 2009 Ill. Laws 34 was a constitutionally legitimate enactment genuinely encompassing one subject, and there was no single subject violation in 2009 Ill. Laws 37 or 38. Also, the contingency provisions in 2009 Ill. Laws 34, 35, 37, and 38 clearly were reasonably related to one another in that they were associated with raising funds for capital projects, establishing capital projects, and appropriating funds to those projects. Furthermore, there was no violation of the Presentment Clause, the Effective Date of Laws Clause, veto procedures, the separation of powers, the Public Funds Clause, or the Uniformity Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Illinois that affirmed a circuit court's adjudication of delinquency based upon a finding that the juvenile was guilty of criminal sexual assault in violation of 720 ILCS 5/12-13(a)(1) (2006) and attempted robbery in violation of 720 ILCS 5/8-4(a) and 18-1 (2006), arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support the ajudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that, despite the inconsistencies concerning events collateral to the criminal sexual conduct, the testimony of the victim and the other witnesses was consistent concerning the sexual assault. The victim testified that the juvenile's brother grabbed her and pulled her behind a duplex, pushed her down, and crammed his penis into her mouth, telling her not to bite. The juvenile then inserted his penis into her vagina from behind. The victim reported to the police and a paramedic that she had been raped, and both witnesses described the victim as emotional and hysterical. A deputy testified that the victim's shirt and bra strap were torn and that she had abrasions on her elbows and arms. In contrast, the juvenile's statements concerning the sexual encounter were inconsistent, initially denying any sexual contact when confronted by police and later indicating that he paid the victim for sex and that the sexual encounter was consensual. It was for the trier of fact to resolve conflicts in the testimony, and the evidence, taken together, was sufficient to satisfy the trial court beyond a reasonable doubt of the juvenile's guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant health care providers appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Illinois that held that plaintiff parents in a wrongful birth case could recover damages for the cost of caring for their dependent, disabled adult child and further held that the parents adequately pled a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents filed suit against the health care providers, alleging that the health care providers failed to advise them of the results of genetic testing done on their first child and that, had they been properly advised, they would not have conceived a second child. On review, the court held that, in Illinois, parents had no obligation to support a disabled child beyond the age of majority. Because the parents had no duty to provide post-majority support, such expenses were not legal harms suffered by the parents and were not compensable damages in a wrongful birth action. Further, the court overruled its prior ruling in Siemieniec v. Lutheran General Hospital, 117 Ill. 2d 230 (1987), which applied the zone of danger rule to wrongful birth plaintiffs' claims for emotional distress. The zone of danger rule applied only in cases where the theory of liability was the negligent infliction of emotional distress; it did not apply where, as in a wrongful birth case, a tort had already been committed against the parents and they asserted emotional distress as an element of damages for that tort.</SPAN></P>

The case was remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for identity theft in violation of the Identity Theft Law, 720 ILCS 5/16G-15(a)(7) (2008). That law provided that a person committed that offense by knowingly using any personal identification information or personal identification document of another to gain access to any record of the actions taken, communications made or received, or other activities or transactions of that person, without the prior express permission of that person. The indictment alleged that defendant knowingly used personal identification information of a specific person without the prior express permission of that person. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss on the ground that the specific statutory provision under which she was indicted did not contain a culpable mental state and, thus, violated her right to due process. The state supreme court found that the statutory provision in question violated her substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Ill. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Appellate Court entered a judgment that affirmed the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff inmate's action seeking declaratory and mandamus relief against defendants, a corrections director and a prisoner review board, after the Board denied his motion recent request for release on parole in a case where he had been convicted of murdering two people. The state supreme court granted the inmate's pro se petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of two murders. He was finally sentenced to two concurrent terms of 30 to 90 years. His requests for parole were denied several times. Also, changes in statutory law permitted annual parole hearings to occur as far apart as every three years. Eventually, he filed a second-amended complaint seeking declaratory and mandamus relief from the parole release denials and claimed that the Illinois parole process violated his constitutional rights. The trial court dismissed that complaint. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court found that following a conviction and sentencing, the Illinois parole release statute did not give an inmate a legitimate expectation of parole that became a liberty interest protected by procedural due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, especially given the Board's discretion in granting parole. It also found the Illinois parole release statute was not an ex post facto law in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 since it did not extend punishment and changes in the Board's interpretation of the criteria for parole was not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed the trial court's summary dismissal of defendant's pro se postconviction relief petition in a case where he was convicted of first-degree murder after a bench trial. It then modified fees and costs the trial court imposed after entering the summary dismissal. The state supreme court granted his  petition for leave to appeal challenging the constitutionality of the statute used to impose the fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder following a bench trial. Thereafter, he filed a pro se postconviction relief petition pursuant to 725 ILCS 5/122-2.1 (2006). The trial court summarily dismissed his pro se postconviction petition, finding that he failed to raise the claims in his direct appeal and that res judicata prevented consideration of them. Indeed, it concluded his postconviction claims were frivolous and patently without merit. Due to the summary dismissal, the trial court imposed fees and costs upon him pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/22-105 (2006) regarding frivolous prisoner pleadings. The appellate court affirmed after modifying the fees and costs. The state supreme court determined that the term frivolous meant the same thing in 735 ILCS 5/22-105(b)(1) (2006) as it did in 725 ILCS 5/122-2.1 (2006) of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act. It then found that 735 ILCS 5/22-105 (2006) did not violate his due process rights since he did not have a fundamental right to file frivolous pleadings and did not violate his equal protection rights because prisoners were not a suspect class and that statute furthered the legislature's goal on reducing frivolous prisoner pleadings.</SPAN></P>

R. 603, defendant, who had pleaded guilty to two murders and had been sentenced to death, challenged his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the removal of his counsel violated his Sixth Amendment and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 (1970) right to counsel. The trial court removed counsel after learning that he was not ready to provide representation to defendant. The appeals court found counsel did not and likely could not tell the court when he would return from vacation in Israel. Counsel's request that another attorney be appointed while counsel was gone undermined counsel's claim that he was ready, willing, and able to represent defendant. Defendant's capital sentence was found to be proper pursuant to 720 ILCS 5/9-1 (2008), as he coldly and brutally murdered two persons who had done nothing to him. While his abusive childhood and early introduction to drugs were mitigating indications of his troubled past, he had rejected multiple attempts to provide the help he needed to overcome that past. The trial court did not erroneously reject the mitigating factor of extreme mental or emotional disturbance. Contrary to defendant's assertion that he lacked emotional control, he explained to officers that he chose to kill a victim because if the victim lived he would have defendant killed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ordered the natural life prison terms to be served concurrently rather than consecutively, but affirmed in all other respects. The state supreme court found that (1) defendant forfeited the issue of whether the stepchildren sufficiently appeared for cross-examination within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause by not objecting at trial; (2) their direct testimony sufficiently allowed for effective cross-examination in any event; (3) 725 ILCS 5/115-10, allowing the admission of child victim's hearsay statements was facially constitutional; and (4) the appellate court correctly granted the State its $ 50 55 ILCS 5/4-2002(a) (2008) assessment since attorneys handling appeals for the State were acting under the State's Attorneys' direction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Appellate Court held that a trial court's decision to not to &quot;recharacterize&quot; a pleading filed by a pro se defendant as a postconviction petition may be reviewed for error. Consequently, it reversed a judgment that dismissed defendant's pro se pleading, and remanded defendant's case with instructions to recharacterize the pleading as a postconviction petition. The state supreme court granted the State's petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of unlawful manufacture of a substance containing methamphetamine weighing between 400 and 900 grams, in violation of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, 720 ILCS 570/401(a)(6.5)(C) (2004). He filed a &quot;petition for relief from judgment,&quot; pursuant to the Illinois and federal constitutions, and 735 ILCS 5/2-1401 (2006). He contended that the waste product was not intended to be considered part of the substance containing methamphetamine, and including it resulted in an unconstitutional penalty. The trial court took actions that indicated that it was recharacterizing the petition as a 725 ILCS 5/122-1(d) (2006) postconviction relief petition, but it then dismissed the petition anyway. The appellate court viewed the trial court's decision as a refusal to recharacterize the petition and reversed the dismissal. The state supreme court found that the trial court was not obligated to recharacterize the petition, but having done so, it should not have dismissed the petition. However, it also found on the merits that the legislature had not intended to exclude the weight of waste products from the drug weight for sentencing purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court affirmed that part of the appellate court's judgment which reversed the judgment of dismissal entered by the trial court. It then modified the appellate court's remand instructions so as to direct the trial court to enter an order allowing defense counsel's amendments to defendant's postconviction petition and to deny defendant's postconviction petition on the merits.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court granted defendant's petition for leave to appeal to review the appellate court's ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged victim went to a police station to report that she had been battered by defendant, her then-boyfriend. She reported to the police officer who interviewed her that defendant had struck and threatened to kill her. The officer observed that she had a black eye and bruises on her arms. Defendant was arrested and charged with, inter alia, domestic battery of her. Prior to trial, the State moved to admit evidence of a prior incident of domestic violence committed by defendant against his ex-wife, as permitted under 725 ILCS 5/115-7.4 (2008) regarding admission of evidence of prior acts of domestic violence. The trial court eventually granted the motion. Following a trial at which his ex-wife testified about defendant striking her, he was convicted of domestic battery in violation of 720 ILCS 5/12-3.2(a)(1) (2006). The appellate court, in affirming, rejected his claim that 725 ILCS 5/115-7.4 (Supp. 2007) violated his right to due process. The state supreme court found that the statute was constitutional because it allowed admission of &quot;other acts&quot; evidence if the requirements of the statute were met and other applicable evidence rules, such as relevance, were followed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee limited liability company sued appellant condominium association president for defamation. In the instant appeal, the court was asked if the president's statement to a reporter during a public forum inside an alderman's office was immunized from the lawsuit under the Citizen Participation Act, 735 ILCS 110/1 et seq. (2008). The trial court found the statement was not immune from suit. The appellate court dismissed the appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The president argued that the appellate court's dismissal of the appeal as moot should have been reversed because the legislature clearly intended for the Act to provide an independent and substantive right to appellate review of final trial court orders denying a motion to dispose of a lawsuit brought pursuant to the Citizen Participation Act, 735 ILCS 110/1 et seq. (2008). The court found that the appellate court's failure to undertake the question of whether the limited liability company's lawsuit could be identified as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) directly contradicted the legislature's explicit expression of public policy regarding the efficient process to identify and adjudicate SLAPPs. The mootness finding also contradicted the legislature's express finding of public policy in favor of an award attorney fees and costs to prevailing movants. 735 ILCS 110/5 (2008). Further, there was a potential injury to the president because the president was denied the relief requested in his motion under the Act to identify the LLC's lawsuit as a SLAPP and for a statutory award of attorney fees and costs. Accordingly, the president's appeal was not moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appellate court and the trial court orders entered on July 29, 2008, and August 19, 2008 were reversed. The president enjoyed immunity from liability in the lawsuit under the Citizen Participation Act. The case was remanded to the circuit court to award the president reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with the motion.</SPAN></P>

Neither appellee state election board nor the trial court or appellate court found that the objector was entitled to relief. The state supreme court found that the candidate was eligible to run for the office he was seeking, as the applicable provision of the Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/8-8 (2008), no longer contained limitations on party-switching restrictions and the candidate's attempt to obtain the state senate seat was in a different election-year cycle than his vote as a Democrat.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Appellate Court rejected respondent minor's claims that the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 ILCS 405/5-615(1) (2006), violated constitutional provisions pertaining to equal protection and separation of powers insofar as it prevented a minor from being placed on supervision without the consent of the State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the minor violated 720 ILCS 5/12-3(a)(2) (2006) by committing a battery. She was thereafter placed on probation for a one year under certain conditions and subjected to paying certain fees. On appeal, she claimed that 705 ILCS 405/5-615(1) (2006) of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 violated constitutional provisions pertaining to equal protection and separation of powers because it prevented a minor from being placed on supervision without the consent of the State. The appellate court rejected those contentions. The state supreme court found that it did not need to reach the constitutional arguments because 705 ILCS 405/5-615(1) (2006) (Act) did not apply to her. It so concluded because it found that by the time in the trial court proceedings that the trial court asked the State about its position on supervision, supervision was no longer an option under the Act's procedural framework because a finding of delinquency had already been entered; it determined that the possibility of supervision had to be broached and considered, if at all, before proceeding to findings and adjudication had occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bus owned and operated by the bus operated collided with the motorist's automobile at an intersection in an Illinois city. Approximately 17 months later, the motorist sued the bus operator for alleged personal injuries he sustained.

The bus operator moved to dismiss, alleged that the Act's limitations period applied to it, and claimed the motorist's action was untimely. The trial court denied the motion, but certified to the appellate court the question of whether the bus operator was a &quot;local public entity.&quot; The appellate court said it was not. The state supreme court disagreed with the trial and appellate courts, and found that bus operator, as a&quot;not-for-profit&quot; corporation, was a &quot;local public entity&quot; under 745 ILCS 10/1-206 (2006) of the Act, and, thus, the Act's one-year statute of limitations applied to bar the motorist's action as untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the conviction for aggravated kidnapping was improperly considered by the jury in determining that death was an appropriate sentence. The supreme court disagreed. Facts adduced at trial relating to the aggravated kidnapping charge were not extensive. The State elicited on direct examination from a doctor only that the cause of death of two victims was a gunshot wound to the head. The State did not ask about time of death and did not ask for an opinion on when the victims were moved. Indeed, it was defense counsel who asked the doctor about the time of death. The doctor acknowledged that the victims were immediately brain dead, but that their hearts could have continued beating for seconds or minutes afterward. The State elicited testimony from several witnesses supporting its theory that the victims' bodies had been moved. Thus, the jury was presented with evidence that the victims were shot in their home. The jury was presented with the entire sequence of events, from the shooting to the cleanup to transporting of the victims. The jury was entitled to give those facts and circumstances aggravating weight under the &quot;catch-all&quot; sentencing factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Clinton County Circuit Court (Illinois) in two cases declared unconstitutional on due process grounds 625 ILCS 5/6-206(a)(43) (2008) requiring suspension of driving privileges if a person received court supervision for the unlawful consumption of alcohol by a person under the age of 21-years-old. Appellant State, represented by the Secretary, appealed and defendants' appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each charged with unlawful consumption of alcohol by a person under 21-years-old, in violation of the Liquor Control Act, 235 ILCS 5/6-20(e) (2008). They moved to declare unconstitutional, inter alia, 625 ILCS 5/6-206(a)(43) (2008) of the Vehicle Code. That section generally authorized the Secretary of State (Secretary) to suspend driving privileges upon conviction or disposition of court supervision for the charged offenses. The trial court declared 625 ILCS 5/6-206(a)(43) (2008) unconstitutional on due process grounds as applied. The state supreme court found that since that the statute only had to bear a rational relationship to a legitimate public interest. It then found that it was reasonable for the General Assembly to believe that a young person disobeying the underage drinking law might also drive after drinking. It also found that the Secretary under the statute lacked discretion over whether to suspend their driving privileges and that the suspension did not violate the Illinois Constitution's proportionate penalties clause, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, because it was not a direct action to inflict punishment, but was meant to protect the public.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed the trial court's judgment that determined the statute at issue regarding suspension of driving privileges was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Appellate Court found that while the State's retention of interest earned on property held it pursuant to the Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act, 765 ILCS 1025/15 (2004), might be a taking, it was not a taking for which just compensation was due under the facts of the case, where the property had been abandoned.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The interest claimants sued the defendants, the state treasurer and the unclaimed property division director, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated seeking payment of interest on their property, money in the case of each of the representative plaintiffs, held by the State under the Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act, 765 ILCS 1025/1 et seq. (2004), prior to their claims of reclamation. The trial court certified dispositive questions to the appellate court. The appellate court held that the retention of interest by the State &quot;may&quot; be a &quot;taking&quot; under Ill.  Const. art. I, &sect; 15 and the Ffth and Fourteenth Amendments, U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, but because the property owners had abandoned the property, the appellate court concluded it was not a taking for which just compensation was due. The state supreme court found that the legislature could enact a statute divesting the property owners of the right to interest payments, without violating the state or federal constitutions, as it was the neglectful property owners' conduct in abandoning the property rather than any action by the State that caused the loss of the right to the interest payments.</SPAN></P>

A backup officer ordered a search of the vehicle although the driver refused to consent to one. Under the front passenger seat, officers found a handgun. Defendant was arrested. He later admitted using the handgun to shoot at the victim. The trial court denied his motion to quash his arrest and suppress evidence. He was convicted on weapons charges. The appellate court vacated a conviction for unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon, but otherwise affirmed. The state supreme court found that (1) defendant as a non-owner passenger lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy in the vehicle to prevent the search of it and discovery of the gun and, thus, could not show a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights; and (2) the vacation of his conviction for unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon was proper since that crime was less serious than his other conviction also based on possession of a gun, aggravated unlawful use of a weapon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois), in a medical malpractice and declaratory action filed by the plaintiffs, a minor and her mother, against defendant healthcare providers, found that 735 ILCS 5/2-1706.5 (2008)'s caps on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases,  both facially and as applied, violated the Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1's separation of powers clause. The state supreme court allowed the healthcare providers' direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor and her mother filed a medical malpractice and declaratory judgment action against the healthcare providers alleging that the minor sustained severe permanent injuries due to healthcare she received at birth. They also alleged that their noneconomic damages would greatly exceed 735 ILCS 5/2-1706.5 (2008)'s caps that specifically limited the recovery of such damages in medical malpractice cases. The trial court, ruling on the pleadings, found the statutory caps operated as a &quot;legislative remittitur&quot; that violated the separation-of-powers clause of  Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. It found the statute unconstitutional facially and as applied, and that its inseverability provision required invalidation of the entire statute. The state supreme court found that since it was facially unconstitutional on separation-of-powers grounds because it was the judiciary's function to reduce verdicts, determining any &quot;as applied&quot; challenge was unnecessary. It thus rejected the healthcare providers' claim that the statute was a valid exercise of the legislature's police powers upon finding the issue was not the wisdom of the law, but whether the law unduly infringed on the judiciary's power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court reversed the trial court's judgment finding that the statute limiting awards of noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases to be unconstitutional &quot;as applied&quot; to the minor and her mother. It affirmed the trial court's finding that the statute was &quot;facially&quot; invalid. It also remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of 16 counts of first degree murder, four counts of home invasion in violation of 720 ILCS 5/12-11(a)(1) (2002), and four counts of aggravated arson in violation of 720 ILCS 5/20-1.1(a)(1) (2002). Defendant was then sentenced, inter alia, to death for the murders. He raised many issues on appeal, such as the trial court granting the State's motion in limine precluding him from cross-examining two police detectives about an unrelated civil case against them, which the appellate court found not to be error. However, it found the trial court erred in dismissing a juror during sentencing deliberations and in replacing him. It found that the dismissed juror's voir dire answers about the death penalty were inconsistent, not dishonest, and that the dismissed juror engaged in jury deliberations. It further found that since he had appeared ready to sign the non-unanimous jury verdict form, defendant might have received a prison term rather than the death penalty, meaning defendant's Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, due process right to a verdict from the jury chosen was violated and precluded imposition of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a delinquency petition in the juvenile court alleging that the juvenile was delinquent because he had committed unlawful restraint and various sexual offenses against his sister. Prior to the adjudicatory hearing, the State sought a ruling on the admissibility of statements the alleged victim had made during an interview with a forensic interviewer. The State presented a DVD of the interview for the juvenile court to consider. At the adjudicatory hearing, the State called the 11-year-old alleged victim as a witness; however, it did not question her about the events and, instead, limited its inquiry to the circumstances surrounding how the videotaped statement was obtained. The trial court then denied the State's motion to admit the recorded statements. The State appealed. The appellate court affirmed. The state supreme court then found that jurisdiction was lacking under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(a)(1) because the juvenile court's order denying the motion to admit did not suppress evidence given that it merely barred one way in which the factfinder might receive the evidence but still raised the possibility that live testimony could be presented about the statements.</SPAN></P>

In doing so, it found 65 ILCS 5/11-13-2 (1996), about notice of public hearings by newspaper publication, to be unconstitutional as applied to them and that the amendment was void as to their parcel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An ordinance allowed the landowners' property allowing to be developed for single-family and multiple use. The landowners built both types of residences on it. The city subsequently decided to adopt a new zoning ordinance. It provided notice in two community newspapers of the desire to adopt the new ordinance, consistent with the notice requirement in 65 ILCS 5/11-13-2 (1996). Multiple parcels of property were affected because parcels were rezoned from multifamily to single-family use. The ordinance passed. About five years later, the landowners discovered they could not develop their remaining property into multifamily units. They sought to have the ordinance amendment declared invalid. The trial court granted their summary judgment motion, found 65 ILCS 5/11-13-2 (1996) was unconstitutional as applied, and declared the ordinance amendment was void as to their parcel. The state supreme court found that the notice given in the two newspapers did not meet Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. XIV, due process standards, as it was not reasonably calculated to give them notice of the public hearing on the proposed ordinance amendment despite that amendment affecting the landowners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed defendant's conviction for not identifying sound recordings with a label containing the actual name and address of the person manufacturing the recording, in violation 720 ILCS 5/16-8 (2004). The state supreme court granted the State's petition for leave to appeal challenging the appellate court's reversal of a separate conviction on preemption grounds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with violating 720 ILCS 5/16-7 (2004), involving the pirating sound recordings produced by others, and 720 ILCS 5/16-8 (2004), failing to identify sound recordings with a label containing the actual name and address of the person who manufactured the recording. The appellate court reversed the 720 ILCS 5/16-7 (2004) conviction, but then rejected due process and First Amendment challenges to the constitutionality of 720 ILCS 5/16-8 (2004). Regarding 720 ILCS 5/16-7 (2004), the state supreme court found that the presumption of state police power superceding federal law did not apply since the United States Congress expressly preempted state law in that area under 17 U.S.C.S. &sect; 301(a), the federal Copyright Act of 1976. It also affirmed the rejection of defendant's due process and First Amendment challenges to 720 ILCS 5/16-8 (2004). It found that the statute (1) furthered a substantial government interest in protecting the public; (2) restricted First Amendment rights no more broadly than needed to further that interest; and (3) had a reasonable relationship to the interest to be served and used means sufficiently reasonable to accomplish that objective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, convicted defendant of the Class 2 offense of possession of a stolen motor vehicle, 625 ILCS 5/4-103(a)(1), (b) (2006). Defendant was sentenced to a Class X term of nine years based on his prior criminal convictions. The court also imposed several monetary charges. The appellate court affirmed. Defendant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asked the supreme court to vacate the two fees and reduce the total assessment by $15 because they violated his federal and state due process rights, U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. He argued that the assessment of the fees was unconstitutional because neither charge bore a rational relationship to the offense of possession of a stolen motor vehicle. The supreme court found that the charges imposed did not seek to compensate the state for any costs incurred as the result of prosecuting defendant. The fact that the proceeds of the fines were earmarked for a specific purpose, unrelated to the offense upon which defendant was convicted, was irrelevant to their constitutionality; rather it was because the charges in no way compensated the state for the cost of prosecuting defendant that they were fines, and not fees. The legislature clearly conferred upon county boards the limited power to enact certain fines or penalties, including the mental health court and youth diversion/peer court fines. The $15 in fines imposed as punishment, 55 ILCS 5/5-1101(d-5) and 55 ILCS 5/5-1101(e) (2006), did not violate defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

While the report the expert tendered stated that a test on a tile directly adjacent to defendant's footprint was negative for the presence of blood, the expert testified at trial that the &quot;negative&quot; result was a false negative. The supreme court concluded that defendant was prejudiced by the State's failure to disclose the expert's opinion regarding the false negative. Had defendant been made aware of the expert's conclusion, he could have called an expert to refute that contention or could have chosen to pursue a different line of defense altogether. The supreme court further found that defendant made reasonable efforts to alleviate the prejudice created by seeking a continuance to find an expert, obtaining an expert despite the trial court's denial of his motion, and seeking to reopen his case to include the expert's testimony, but that his attempts were wrongfully thwarted by the trial court. Thus, defendant was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court granted the State's petition for leave to appeal that the State filed to challenge the appellate court's affirmance of those rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a pretrial detainee in another case. He became a suspect in an unrelated murder case. On two separate dates, city police officers signed defendant out of the county jail, transported him to a city police station, and put him in an interview room with an informant. The informant was wearing a court-ordered concealed wire. During recorded conversations, defendant allegedly implicated himself in the murder. He was later charged with it. He then moved to suppress the conversations. The trial court eventually suppressed all of the statements and recordings regarding those conversations, and found the recordings to be inaudible. The appellate court affirmed and also found the recordings to be inaudible. The state supreme court first found that all of the statements and recordings, not some of them, had been suppressed. It then found that the appellate court erred in concluding that statements made during a 730 ILCS 135/19.5 (2002) temporary transfer were illegally obtained because the plain language of that statute did not require a court order for the transfer to occur. However, it agreed with the trial and appellate court that the recordings were inaudible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court found the appellate court did not exceed its scope of review on interlocutory appeal. It also reversed the appellate court's judgment affirming suppression of the statements. However, it affirmed the appellate court's judgment upholding suppression of the recordings as substantially inaudible. It then ordered remand of the case to the appellate court for further proceedings regarding suppression of the statements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the employer failed to withhold any of the father's wages, pursuant to the withholding notice, for over seven months after the notice was served on the employer. Eventually, the trial court imposed a $ 100-per-day penalty for each violation of the Withholding Act, 750 ILCS 28/1 et seq. (2006), pursuant to Illinois law. The mother calculated 3,690 alleged penalties, reflected in the trial court's order, resulting in the judgment of $ 369,000. The appellate court found that this was error. The employer was located in Mississippi, and the penalty for violating the withholding notice should have been calculated based on Mississippi law, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 93-11-117(1) (2006), which provided for a penalty of not more than $ 500, or $ 1,000 where there was collusion between the employer and employee. The Uniform Interstate Family Support Act established a uniform procedure for enforcing an out-of-state child support order. However, it uniformly directed the employer-violator to the law of its state for the appropriate sanction. Based on this reciprocal statutory scheme, the employer should have been penalized according to the law of its state-Mississippi.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the trial court to recalculate the penalty. Otherwise, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with, inter alia, aggravated battery and first-degree murder for aiding and abetting codefendants in fatally beating a victim with their fists, feet, and a board. During jury selection, the State used a peremptory strike to get excused an African-American prospective juror. The jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder under a general verdict, that is, without specifying whether the murder was based on the intent, knowledge, or felony murder theory pled by the State. It also found him guilty of aggravated burglary. The appellate court affirmed the convictions and sentence. The state supreme court found that the trial court's finding that defendant, an African-American, did not prove a prima facie case of racial discrimination was not clearly erroneous since the Caucasian jurors' responses were justified and instructing the jury on felony murder, where the predicate felony allegedly was inherent in the killing itself was at most harmless error because the jury's general verdict meant that defendant under 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a) (2004) was presumed to be convicted of the most serious form of the offense, intentional murder, rather than felony murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial, the trial court adjudicated the minor delinquent for committing, inter alia, criminal sexual assault. At sentencing, the minor argued he should not be required to register under the Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 ILCS 150/1 et seq. (2004) (Act), because he was not entitled to a jury trial on the charges. The trial court judge entered an order exempting the minor from the registration requirement of the Act and, thus, did not advise him of a duty to register under the Act. The State moved for leave to file an original mandamus action pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 381(a) seeking an order vacating the trial court's order and mandating that the minor comply with the Act. The state supreme court found the State entitled to the requested mandamus relief. It determined that the minor had not presented a valid nonconstitutional or constitutional ground for denying that relief. It first noted that the Act's registration requirements did not constitute punishment and then found that its plain language clearly required the minor to register and imposed a clear, nondiscretionary duty upon the respondent to advise the minor of his registration obligation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases, the first defendant and second defendant were each charged with intentional murder, knowing murder, and felony murder, and felony offenses underlying the felony-murder charges lodged against them. At their trials, they requested separate verdict forms. The trial courts denied the requests. In both cases, the jury returned general verdicts of guilty of first-degree murder, 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a) (2006), and they were also found guilty of the underlying felony offenses.  At sentencing, the trial courts sentenced them on their murder convictions and, additionally, imposed consecutive terms for the underlying felonies. The appellate court affirmed the convictions, but held the trial court had erred by refusing the requests for separate verdict forms and modified the sentences. The state supreme court found that given the unsuccessful requests for separate forms and the jury's guilty finding without specifying which of the mental states set forth in 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a) (2006) the verdicts were based on, knowledge, intent, or felony murder, sentencing had to based on the least serious form of murder, felony murder, as that was the only unquestionable mental state involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial, the trial court found defendant guilty of felony disorderly conduct under 720 ILCS 5/26-1(a)(4) (2006). The Circuit Court of Kendall County (Illinois) declined to impose a felony sentence, finding a violation of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, the proportionate penalties clause, and instead imposed a misdemeanor sentence of one year's probation. The State appealed the constitutional ruling directly to the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After determining that it had jurisdiction to review the State's challenge, the supreme court considered whether 720 ILCS 5/26-1(a)(4) (2006) violated the proportionate penalties clause of the Illinois Constitution, Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The supreme court held that &sect; 26-1 was not unconstitutional under the &quot;identical elements&quot; test. The supreme court concluded that &sect; 26-1(a)(4) and (a)(12) did not share identical elements, as &sect; 26-1(a)(12) required calling 911, and thus, differing sentencing classifications for a Class 4 felony and a Class A misdemeanor did not offend the proportionate penalties clause of &sect; 11. In response to defendant's other claims, the supreme court found that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the sufficiency of the information, as the information contained sufficient particularity to allow defendant to prepare a defense. Defendant's right to confrontation was not violated when the trial court prohibited additional cross examination of defendant's neighbor, as the neighbor's bias was explored during cross-examination, and defendant could not show prejudice, as he would have been convicted even if the offer of proof had been made.</SPAN></P>

The controversy involved the judge's repeated removal of an individual assistant public defender from representing clients in his courtroom.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent repeatedly recused himself from cases in which the assistant public defender represented the defendants in his courtroom and also directed her repeatedly to step down from serving as the assigned public defender in his courtroom for defendants she had already been representing. The Court held that the issue was not mooted since the manner in which respondent assigned cases to assistant public defenders in individual cases was still at issue. The court held that a judge had the authority to remove a public defender from a case and assign another under certain circumstances, but that such circumstances were not shown in the case at bar. The court held in the absence of respondent finding the assistant public defender at issue in contempt or having other cause, his actions were not within his inherent power to manage his courtroom and calendar and were directed at an individual attorney, which infringed upon petitioner's statutory authority. The court further noted that respondent failed to make a record sufficient to justify his actions. The court discerned that neither mandamus nor prohibition were appropriate remedies and, instead, set forth a supervisory order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the witness both attended a hearing in another criminal proceeding where defendant was accused of wrongdoing. The witness was both a potential witness and the mother of an alleged victim. After the hearing, defendant and the witness both took the same road to get from the courthouse to their respective homes. Defendant phoned 911 to report the witness as a drunk driver. He gave the 911 operator the witness's license plate number and stated that he saw a half-covered bottle in the car. The witness was subsequently stopped by a police officer. The officer did not notice any erratic driving or any signs of intoxication or drinking. The officer saw no beverage container. The Illinois Supreme Court held the witness's testimony as to having suffered stomach dropping, nerve racking, wondering what she had done wrong, knowing that she had not done anything wrong, and anger were included within the scope of 720 ILCS 5/32-4a. Having found that the statute incorporated a more expansive definition of &quot;emotional distress&quot; than defendant contended, the State met its burden of proof.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee estate filed an action against appellants, a sheriff and a manufacturer. Following discovery, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellants. The Appellate Court (Illinois) reversed the grant of summary judgment to the sheriff on the issue of respondeat superior and to the manufacturer with regard to the duty to warn claim, but affirmed the remainder of the trial court's order. The sheriff and the manufacturer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate's decedent, a child, was killed when a friend who was playing with the service weapon of his father shot him. The estate sued the sheriff based on a respondeat superior theory and sued the manufacturer based on a strict products liability theory. The supreme court found error in the appellate court's determination that the father was acting within the scope of his employment when he stored his weapon and that the sheriff was liable for the father's tortious acts. The father, a correctional officer, was not required to own a gun and did not need to carry it to work. The father's negligent storage of the gun was not the kind of conduct that he was employed to perform, nor was it incidental to his employment. With regard to the manufacturer, summary judgment was proper as to the defective design claim because, inter alia, the gun performed as expected and was not unreasonably dangerous for its intended use as a law enforcement service weapon. The failure to warn claim against the manufacturer was barred by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 7901-7903, as the discharge of the gun was caused by a volitional act that constituted a criminal offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county and a city, challenged an Illinois appellate court's reversal of a ruling that upheld a small venue exemption, on grounds that amusement tax ordinances (Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 4-156-020(A) (2008) and Cook County, Ill., Amusement Tax Ordinance &sect; 3 (1999)) were not overbroad nor vague, but granted appellants' 735 ILCS 5/2-615 (2006) motion to dismiss appellee business owner's complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinances drew a clear distinction between two entirely different types of entertainment. The exemptions fell within the authority of the government to make content-based distinctions when it subsidized speech, and the owner could not plead any set of facts that demonstrated otherwise. The subsidy was in the public interest--encouraging fine arts performances in small venues--and was defined in such a way to achieve those ends. It was logical to exclude categories of protected speech that did not advance its goals, e.g., movies, television, promotional shows, performances at adult entertainment cabarets, and performances in venues that seated more than 750 persons. The subsidy of all productions at small fine arts venues had no minimum standards, and no considerations of viewpoint were taken into account. The subsidy was not aimed at suppressing dangerous ideas. The activities in the owner's business were neither fine arts nor cultural; the activities presented an entirely different type of entertainment. Thus, denying adult entertainment cabarets an exemption reserved for small fine arts venues was reasonable and did not offend the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Illinois filed a petition for adjudication of wardship pursuant to &sect; 2-13 of the Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 ILCS 405/2-13 (1998). A circuit court adjudicated appellee minor delinquent. The Illinois Appellate Court vacated the order. The State filed a petition for leave to appeal pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 315.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor argued that the adjudication of delinquency was void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because her father was not served with written notice that the petition by the State of Illinois was amended to add an additional charge, in violation of &sect; 5-530 of the Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987, 705 ILCS 405/5-530 (2004). On appeal, the court found that the intermediate appellate court incorrectly concluded that compliance with the notice requirements of the Act was an unwaivable condition precedent to the circuit court's exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over the justiciable matter before it. When the minor's parents appeared at the detention hearing and were given a copies of the petition, personal jurisdiction over them was established under 705 ILCS 405/5-525(4) (2004). Further, the State's failure to give notice of an amendment to the father under 705 ILCS 405/5-530 did not cause the circuit court to lose jurisdiction. Finally, the evidence that the minor participated in the aggravated battery of the victim under 720 ILCS 5/5-2 (2004) was not so closely balanced that she was entitled to a new hearing on that charge on the basis of plain error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the intermediate appellate court was reversed, and the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county political party filed complaints with appellee state board of elections alleging violations of the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/1-1 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board did not determine that the complaints were filed on justifiable grounds when it voted four-to-four on that question; thus, the Board complied with the clear directive of 10 ILCS 5/9-21 (2004) by dismissing the complaints. The tie-vote dismissals were subject to judicial review under the plain language of 10 ILCS 5/9-22 (2004) and the provisions of the Administrative Review Law, 735 ILCS 5/3-110 (2004). The scope of review extended to all questions of law and fact presented by the entire record before the court. Dismissal of the complaints could be reviewed by considering whether the members voting to dismiss clearly erred in determining that they were not filed on justifiable grounds. The reasons for dismissal adopted from the general counsel's recommendation was reviewable for clear error. The dismissals could not be overturned unless the court was left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake was committed. Given the construction of the Code providing for judicial review of deadlock dismissals, it was unnecessary to consider the arguments challenging the Code's constitutionality or whether those arguments were procedurally defaulted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court's judgment affirming the dismissals of the complaints and remanded the matter to the appellate court to conduct the judicial review of the dismissals consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Illinois Attorney General (AG) on behalf of the People of the State of Illinois, filed an original mandamus action seeking to vacate a sentence of court supervision imposed on respondent driver by respondent judge for the driver's DUI conviction. The AG contended that court supervision was prohibited by 730 ILCS 5/5-6-1(d)(3) (2006) because the driver previously pled guilty to reckless driving as a result of a plea agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge contended that &sect; 5-6-1(d)(3) prohibited the imposition of court supervision only if a defendant had previously pled guilty to reckless driving as a result of a plea agreement that reduced a charge of DUI. The supreme court disagreed. Under the plain language of &sect; 5-6-1(d)(3), a previous guilty plea to reckless driving under a plea agreement was the only requirement for barring a sentence of court supervision. There was no requirement for the plea agreement to reduce a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol to reckless driving. The docket sheet from the driver's prior conviction showed that he pled guilty to reckless driving prior to trial and that by agreement the State moved to nol-pros the DUI charge. The driver received consideration in exchange for his guilty plea to reckless driving based on the State's agreement to dismiss the DUI charge. The record, therefore, clearly established that the driver's guilty plea was the result of a plea agreement. Accordingly, &sect; 5-6-1(d)(3) precluded a sentence of court supervision for the driver's subsequent DUI conviction. The judge had no discretion to depart from the mandatory provisions of &sect; 5-6-1(d)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court granted mandamus relief, directing the judge to vacate the sentence of court supervision and to impose a sentence in accord with the Unified Code of Corrections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to sexual assault during a residential burglary and home invasion, residential burglary, home invasion, and unlawful restraint, violations of 720 ILCS 5/12-14(a)(4), 12-11(a)(2), 19-3(a) and 10-3(a) (2002). An appellate court (Illinois) vacated the sexual assault and home invasion convictions and the extended-term sentence for unlawful restraint, and reduced the sentence to the maximum nonextended term. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued for the abolishment of the one-act, one-crime doctrine because the rationale for the doctrine no longer existed because parole was abolished. In light of the court's treatment of one-act, one-crime violations as adversely affecting the integrity of the judicial process under the second prong of the plain-error rule, the court declined to abandon the doctrine. The court held that where there were multiple convictions for aggravated criminal sexual assault based upon the same physical act, none of the offenses were more serious than any other--none of the offenses involved a more culpable or less culpable mental state. The State had the opportunity to argue to the appellate court that there was no one-act, one-crime violation and that defendant was properly convicted of both sexual assault offenses. Instead, the State conceded that one of the convictions had to be vacated on one-act, one-crime principles. The State did not raise the issue in its petition for leave to appeal. There was no basis to ignore the State's forfeiture of the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the cause to the trial court for a determination as to which sexual assault conviction would be retained and for resentencing in accordance with 730 ILCS 5/5-8-4 (2002). The court affirmed the remainder of the appellate court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, pharmacists and pharmacy owners and operators, challenged a decision of an appellate court (Illinois) that affirmed the dismissal of their declaratory judgment suit against appellees, state officials and the Board of Pharmacy, to invalidate a rule that violated the Health Care Right of Conscience Act (745 ILCS 70/1 et seq. (2004)), the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (775 ILCS 35/1 et seq. (2004)), and U.S. Const. amend, I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants claimed that Ill. Admin. Code tit. 68, &sect; 1330.91(j), requiring dispensing of Plan B contraceptives, violated their moral and religious beliefs that life began at conception and that Plan B acted as an abortifacient. The court found that the claims were ripe under Abbott Laboratories. The claims were legal in nature. Sufficient hardship existed so as to make judicial review appropriate. The rule's revised form was more coercive in that it required the stocking and dispensing of Plan B contraception. A failure to make efforts to stock the contraceptive subjected violators to penalties, including license revocation. Application of the rule to appellants was not remote; they had already suffered financial loss, and the rule chilled their First Amendment rights by forcing them to comply or compromise their rights to act according to their consciences and religious tenets. Appellants did not have to exhaust administrative remedies because the Pharmacy Act of 1987, 225 ILCS 85/11 et seq. (2004), did not provide for review. Because the case involved a question of law that did not involve agency expertise, appellants did not have to seek a variance before suing in circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow brought a wrongful death action against defendants, a subcontractor and two companies that ultimately settled with plaintiff. After judgment was entered against the subcontractor, the Illinois Appellate Court remanded for a new trial on liability only, directing that fault for the accident be reapportioned under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-1117 (1987). Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that under &sect; 2-1117, a nonsettling defendant's fault should be assessed relative to the fault of all defendants, including settling ones. Holding that &sect; 2-1117 was ambiguous, the court concluded that &sect; 2-1117, as enacted in 1986, was never intended to include settling tortfeasors in the apportionment of fault. In 1995, the appellate court had held that settling defendants were not to be included in the apportionment of fault; the legislature's failure to address this holding in 2003, when it amended the statute in other respects, indicated its acceptance of this judicial interpretation. Furthermore, under amendments in 1995, which were ultimately held unconstitutional, settling tortfeasors were to be included on the verdict form. This constituted a recognition that they were not originally included in the apportionment of fault. Next, the court could not review the subcontractor's argument that in upholding the amount of the damages award, the appellate court erred in applying procedural default. Review would require examination of the briefs filed in the appellate court, which had not been made part of the record pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 318(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court upholding the amount of the damages award. It reversed the remainder of the appellate court's judgment and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administrator sued, among others, appellee subcontractor, seeking damages for the alleged wrongful death of the administrator's decedent. After the other defendants settled, a jury awarded damages to the administrator. The Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, Third Division, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded, directing that fault for the accident be reapportioned. The administrator appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subcontractor argued that the trial court erred by failing to include the settling tortfeasors on the verdict form so that the jury could have determined their share of fault. The issue on appeal was whether the settling tortfeasors were defendants sued by the administrator within the meaning of former 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1117. The appellate court found that the statute was ambiguous with regard to whether it included within its scope settling tortfeasors. However, an earlier appellate decision had held that, under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1117, settling defendants were not to be included in the apportionment of fault, and a later amendment to the statute did not deal with this prior holding. This indicated that the legislature accepted this judicial interpretation. Former 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/2-1117, as enacted in 1986, did not apply to good-faith settling tortfeasors who had been dismissed from the suit. The subcontractor's argument that it was deprived of a sole proximate cause defense was raised in the intermediate appellate court, but was not addressed by that court in light of its remand order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the intermediate appellate court's judgment reversing the trial court as to liability was reversed. The judgment of the intermediate appellate court upholding the amount of the damages award was affirmed. The case was remanded to the intermediate appellate court for a decision on the subcontractor's claim that the jury should have been instructed on sole proximate cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant beneficiary filed a complaint against appellee attorney in the circuit court for legal malpractice. The trial court dismissed the complaint as time-barred under &sect; 13-214.3(d) of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(d) (1994). The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed the trial court's judgment. The beneficiary appealed pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 315(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney, who prepared a living trust for the beneficiary's brother, prepared an amendment to the living trust which conveyed the brother's residence to the beneficiary. When the brother died, the probate court denied the beneficiary's claim against her brother's estate. The beneficiary alleged that the attorney failed to exercise reasonable care in creating the trust amendment, because a sufficient title search would have revealed that the actual owner of the property was not the brother individually, but another trust. The state supreme court found that the beneficiary alleged legal malpractice in the drafting of the amendment to her brother's trust. Because the brother could have revoked that amendment or changed the beneficiary prior to his death, the injury did not occur until his death. Consequently, 735 ILCS 5/13-214.3(d) applied to the beneficiary's claim. Further, because letters of office were issued and the brother's will was admitted to probate, the beneficiary was required to file her complaint within the time for filing claims against the estate or the time for filing a petition contesting the validity of the will. However, the beneficiary failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court (Illinois) reversed the adjudication and remanded for a new trial, ruling that hearsay testimony of two witnesses had been improperly admitted under Crawford v. Washington and that 725 ILCS 5/115-10 (2002) was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court admitted into evidence hearsay statements the child made to his mother and a videotaped statement the child made to a child advocate. The child identified respondent in court, but refused to testify regarding the offense charged.

The appellate court reversed, holding: (1) the statements were inadmissible under Crawford because they were for investigative purposes and testimonial in nature, the child did not testify at trial and respondent had no opportunity to cross-examine; and (2) &sect; 115-10 was unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted introduction of testimonial statements in violation of the Confrontation Clause. The supreme court agreed that the videotaped statement was admitted in violation of respondent's confrontation rights but that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because properly admitted evidence overwhelmingly supported the conviction. The State withdrew its challenge concerning &sect; 115-10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appellate court judgment, which reversed respondent's adjudication, and remanded the case to the circuit court with instructions that respondent's adjudication be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Illinois State Board of Education, filed a petition for leave to appeal after an Illinois appellate court ruled that 105 ILCS 5/7-2b (1998) was preempted by the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), 20 U.S.C.S. &sect;1701 et seq., and remanded a school district annexation matter to the Board for consideration of the EEOA claim made by appellee, the Board of Education, Joliet Township High School District No. 204.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">District 204 raised its EEOA claim as an objection to a petition under &sect; 7-2b to detach a parcel of land from District 204 and annex it to a second high school district. District 204 argued that the detachement/annexation (D/A) increased segregation in violation of the EEOA. The EEOA prohibited educational agencies in acting in discriminatory ways, but there was no language in the EEOA that required any state or &quot;educational agency&quot; to consider the segregative effects of their actions prior to taking them. Further, due to limiting language in &sect; 7-2b, neither the hearing officer nor the Board could consider the EEO claim in conjunction with the &sect; 7-2b petition. As a result, the circuit court could not consider the EEOA claim as part of its administrative review of the D/A decision. The circuit court could, however, consider the EEOA claim under its Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9 grant of original jurisdiction over justiciable matters. Given the nature of the claim, District 204 could seek an injunction pending resolution of the claim in the circuit court. Thus, &sect; 7-b2 did not conflict with the purposes and objectives of the EEOA, and the EEOA did not preempt &sect; 7-2b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed that portion of the appellate court's decision that held that &sect; 7-2b was preempted by the EEOA and remanded the matter to the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was a defective design case dealing with the driver's seat in a car. The supreme court rejected defendants' assertion, the risk-utility test was the sole measure of the dangerousness of an allegedly defectively designed product in all strict liability cases or in a subset of those cases. Both the consumer-expectation test and the risk-utility test applied in design defect cases. However, the supreme court did adopt an integrated risk-utility test that included consumer expectation as an element of the broader risk-utility test. The consumer-expectation test and the risk-utility test were methods of proof, not theories of liability. In the instant case, there was evidence to support defendants' position that under the risk-utility test, the seat was not unreasonably dangerous. Because there was no pattern instruction on the risk-utility test, defendants tendered a non-pattern instruction that the trial court declined to give. Defendants were entitled to a risk-utility instruction, and therefore, were entitled to a new trial on liability. As a new trial was necessary, the supreme court did not reach the question of whether the damage award was excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for possession with intent to deliver 900 or more grams of cocaine and more than 5000 grams of cannabis. Defendant argued that his arrest by Chicago police was illegal because it took place in Indiana. The trial court, vacating a prior order, granted his motion to suppress. The State filed an interlocutory appeal. The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed the trial court's decision. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the arrest did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Chicago police were in fresh pursuit of a person they suspected to be a fleeing felon; thus, they had the common-law authority to effect an arrest outside the limits of Illinois. Aside from the fact that the Chicago police failed to comply with the magistrate provision of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-33-3-2 (1998), defendant's arrest was valid. Although defendant was not brought before an Indiana magistrate, he was promptly taken before an Illinois judge; thus, his due process rights were not violated. Furthermore, the violation of &sect; 35-33-3-2 itself did not mandate exclusion. The statutory language did not impose such a requirement, and the statute did not involve a fundamental right of defendant. The arrest did not involve any police misconduct, willful disregard for the laws of Indiana or its territorial borders, or false representations of law; the officers were not aware they were in Indiana. Furthermore, comity did not require exclusion. The Indiana Supreme Court had held that a trial court's jurisdiction did not depend upon the legality of a defendant's arrest or return to the wanting state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court affirming the decision of the trial court. It reinstated the trial court's original determination that defendant's motion to quash and suppress be denied and remanded the cause to the trial court for trial.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to natural life imprisonment after he was adjudged an habitual criminal pursuant to the Habitual Criminal Act, 720 ILCS 5/33B-1 et seq. (2002). The Appellate Court (Illinois) affirmed the sentence. Defendant appealed, seeking a remand on grounds that the trial court lacked authority to sentence him as an habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court adhered to its holding in Robinson that &sect; 33B-2(b) created a permissive rebuttable presumption of eligibility and held that the Act required the State to prove defendant's eligibility for habitual criminal sentencing by showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he had three convictions for qualifying offenses that met the time and sequence requirements of &sect; 33B-1(d). Certified records of the convictions, as prima facie evidence, created an inference or rebuttable presumption that he was eligible for habitual criminal sentencing. Defendant had no actual burden to produce any evidence at his sentencing hearing; but, once the State produced prima facie evidence, the sentencing court was permitted to find that the State had met its burden of persuasion. Pursuant to &sect; 33B-2, defendant forfeited the right to challenge his habitual criminal sentence on appeal because he offered no evidence to rebut the presumption of eligibility and admitted that he was eligible. The sentencing court was authorized to find that the State had met its burden of persuasion and the habitual criminal sentence imposed by the court is not void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a health care system and two doctors, appealed a judgment of the Illinois Court of Appeals for the Fourth District, which reversed the dismissal of the medical malpractice action filed by plaintiff, the special administrator of a decedent's estate. The complaint, refiled after a voluntary dismissal, had been dismissed for failure to serve a 735 ILCS 5/2-622 (2002) certificate of merit with the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case turned on the question of whether 1997 Ill. Laws 579 (PA 90-579) had reenacted the 1995 version of &sect; 2-622, which had been struck down by the Best decision along with the rest of the 1995 Civil Justice Reform Amendments (CJRA). The 1995 version of &sect; 2-622 precluded a plaintiff from obtaining a 90-day extension for filing a certificate of merit if a case had previously been voluntarily dismissed. The pre-1995 version of &sect; 2-622 did not include that restriction The supreme court held that PA 90-579 did not reenact the 1995 version of &sect; 2-622. To the extent that Cargill v. Czelatdko, 353 Ill. App. 3d 654 (2004), Crull v. Sriratana, 376 Ill. App. 3d 803 (2007), and other cases held otherwise, they were overruled. Under 25 ILCS 10/10(f) (2004), 5 ILCS 70/5 (2004), new language amending a statute was to be underscored or italicized. The only such words in P.A. 90-579 were words adding naprapaths to the covered health professionals list. The legislative history of P.A. 90-579 also supported a finding that it was not intended to reenact the 1995 version of &sect; 2-622. Thus, the pre-1995 version of &sect; 2-622, as amended by P.A. 90-579 to include narapraths, applied to the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Treasurer of the State of Illinois and the Illinois Racing Board, challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois), which granted plaintiff casinos summary judgment in their action seeking a declaration that 2005 Ill. Laws 94--804 (the Act), which imposed a 3 percent surcharge on riverboat casinos that had adjusted gross receipts (AGR) of over $ 200 million, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the circuit court erred in holding that the Act violated the uniformity clause, Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970). The casinos failed to show that there was no real and substantial difference between all casinos and casinos with an AGR over $ 200 million. There was a reasonable relationship between the classification and object of the legislation. The legislature provided express findings regarding the necessity of the tax imposed on the casinos, and those findings had to be accorded great deference. The uniformity clause allowed subclassifications and exclusions as long as they were reasonable. Quantitative differences in AGR could be sufficient to justify a classification. The 3 percent surcharge was not subject to a takings challenge. It was not a taking of private property within the meaning of the constitutional takings clauses, U.S. Const. amend. V and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 (1970) because it was not tied to real property. The Act did not violate the public funds clause, Ill. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 (1970), because it served a public purpose. The surcharge would benefit the general well-being of society and the prosperity of the people of the State.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court vacated the dismissal and remanded the case. The State appealed. The court held that the plain language of Ill. Sup. Ct.

The court held that the appellate court erred in finding that appointed counsel did not comply with Rule 651(c) because he filed a certificate confirming his in-person consultation with the prisoner to ascertain the prisoner's contentions of constitutional deprivations, his examination of the record, and his conclusion that no amendment to the pro se petition was necessary for an adequate presentation of the prisoner's contentions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former prisoner filed a complaint for mandamus under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 381, seeking an order directing defendant Prisoner Review Board to eliminate the condition of electronic home confinement (EHC) during his mandatory supervised release (MSR). Prior to oral argument on his complaint, however, the prisoner's EHC was terminated, and the electronic monitoring device was removed. The Board then moved to dismiss the complaint as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner claimed that the Board  lacked statutory authority to impose EHC as a condition of MSR and that the Board lacked the authority to impose EHC at the time of the offenses and that any reliance on the legislature's subsequent grant of authority violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court applied the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine and reviewed the claim, finding that the Board had discretion to impose EHC as a condition of MSR. There was no ex post facto violation because 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-3-7(a) was in effect when the prisoner committed offense and when the Board imposed EHC. The prisoner was not unconstitutionally subject to EHC while on MSR because he was still in the Department of Corrections' custody and under sentence. MSR was a mandatory part of his sentence. He was not yet entitled to full freedom. EHC during MSR did not constitute continued incarceration. He was not denied the benefit of his plea bargain because the absence of a specific admonishment that EHC could be a potential MSR condition did not change the essential terms of his plea agreement.</SPAN></P>

The board therefore declared that the candidate's nomination papers were invalid and ordered that his name not be printed on the ballot for the election. On appeal, the state supreme court found that the appeal was not moot, even though the election had passed, pursuant to the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine Furthermore, pursuant to &sect; 3.1-10-5(b) of the Illinois Municipal Code, read in conjunction with &sect; 10-5 of the Illinois Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/10-5 (2006), the candidate was not eligible to run for the municipal office because he was in arrears of a debt owed to the municipality at the time he filed his nomination papers, even though after the objection was filed the candidate attempted to tender the payment of the debt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a circuit court found defendant guilty of violating 625 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/12-612 (2004), the Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) declared the statute unconstitutional as violative of substantive due process guarantees. Based on that opinion, the Circuit Court of Grundy County (Illinois) dismissed indictments against two other defendants. The State appealed all three cases, which were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 12-612 barred the possession or ownership of a vehicle that had a false or hidden compartment. The State claimed that nonconstitutional grounds that could have resolved the cases should have been addressed before &sect; 12-612 was declared unconstitutional. As to the first defendant, the court found that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction. The other circuit court had to follow the holding of the appellate court, whether or not it agreed with that holding. The statute required that the compartment be both intended &quot;and designed&quot; to be used to conceal, hide, and prevent discovery of the compartment or its contents. In each case, the compartment was designed to contain an air bag. Assuming that the purpose of the statute was the laudable goal of protecting police and punishing those who hid guns and illegal contraband from officers, the court held that the statute was not a reasonable method of accomplishing the desired objective. Because the intent of the legislature was to punish those who concealed firearms or contraband in false or secret compartments, the rational approach was to punish--via an additional felony offense--those who actually did that.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Illinois administratively adjudged and sought spousal support from the community spouses for their institutionalized spouses. Rather than proceeding with further administrative options, the community spouses alleged that art. X of the Illinois Public Aid Code, 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/10-1 through 10-28 (2006), and its implementing regulations conflicted with the MCCA, and thus were preempted pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. The state supreme court found that the community spouses were not required to exhaust administrative remedies before they sought declaratory and injunctive relief because their action was a constitutional challenge to a statute, falling within a recognized exception to the exhaustion doctrine. Moreover, the MCCA did not preempt art. X of the Illinois Public Aid Code because, while the MCCA addressed eligibility determinations and the post-eligibility income of a potentially impoverished spouse, it said nothing about the ability of the State of Illinois to seek reimbursement from an otherwise financially secure community spouse.</SPAN></P>

The trial court set aside that decision, but the appellate court upheld the electoral board. The state supreme court found that (1) the case was not moot even though the election had occurred because the public interest exception applied, (2) arguments regarding the weight of the evidence about payment of the debt and a constitutional issue were defaulted for failure to present them to the electoral board, and (3) though the statute was ambiguous about what the word &quot;eligible&quot; meant, when considered along with the Election Code, 10 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought further review after an Illinois appellate court affirmed a trial court's denial of defendant's motion to withdraw his open plea of guilty to a charge of residential burglary. Defendant argued that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to advise defendant of the possibility of pleading guilty but mentally ill (GBMI) pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/113-4(d) (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As there was no plea agreement, there could be no argument that any undue influence or force was involved. Thus, there was no basis to conclude defendant's plea was involuntary. Defendant's lack of information about a GBMI plea was not sufficient to render his plea of guilty unknowing or involuntary. Further, defendant was not prejudiced by the entry of his plea, and therefore, he could not satisfy the second prong of the Strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel. A GBMI plea would not have affected the length of defendant's sentence. Also, because the Department of Corrections was aware of defendant's mental health issues, there was virtually no difference in the treatment that defendant would receive under his guilty plea as opposed to a GBMI plea. The Eighth Amendment required that he receive adequate medical care. Likewise, under Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect;&sect; 415.40, 415.30 (2007), defendant was to have access to mental health services and was to be informed of the procedures for obtaining those services. While a GBMI adjudication required the Department to examine defendant periodically, those examinations did not guarantee treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile court found appellant juvenile guilty of aggravated battery and adjudicated her delinquent.

Ann. 5/5-4-3(a)(3.5) (2004) of the Illinois Unified Code of Corrections. The Court of Appeals of Illinois upheld the constitutionality of the DNA indexing statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile contended that the compulsory extraction of her saliva, its analysis for DNA genetic marker groupings, and the perpetual storage and open-ended potential for repeated searches of her genetic profile under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-4-3 (2004) violated her right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amends. IV and XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. She also contended that the statute, when applied to minors adjudicated delinquent, permitted an unreasonable invasion of privacy, in violation of the Privacy Clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The state supreme court found that the juvenile's right to be free from unreasonable searches under the Fourth Amendment was not violated by the DNA indexing statute. Further, the juvenile was not entitled to greater Fourth Amendment protections by reason of her minority or her status as a nonsexual felony offender. Moreover, there was no basis for interpreting the search and seizure provision of the Illinois Constitution as providing any greater rights to the juvenile than the Fourth Amendment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the dismissal of a prior suit, plaintiff relatives sued defendants, a city and a fire commissioner, alleging willful and wanton misconduct in providing emergency services to a decedent. The circuit court granted defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-619 (2006) based on res judicata. The Appellate Court for the First District (Illinois) affirmed. The relatives' petition for leave to appeal was allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The five-year-old decedent died from acute asthma exacerbation after his mother called 911. In the prior suit, the relatives' negligence count was dismissed and the relatives voluntarily dismissed the remaining willful and wanton misconduct count pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1009 (2000). The relatives refiled their wrongful-death action, setting forth only one count for willful and wanton misconduct. The supreme court determined that res judicata barred the refiled willful and wanton misconduct claim because (1) under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 273, the involuntary dismissal of the negligence claim constituted an adjudication on the merits for res judicata purposes, (2) the willful and wanton count arose out of the same set of operative facts as the negligence count and the relatives could have litigated and resolved the willful and wanton misconduct claim in the prior suit, (3) no exceptions were present, and (4) there was no basis for concluding that the legislature intended in 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1009 and 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-217 (1994) to give the relatives an absolute right to split their claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the circuit court to aggravated possession of a stolen motor vehicle. He was sentenced to a term of probation. Defendant's plea was withdrawn, and he was convicted of possession of a stolen motor vehicle and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. An appellate court (Illinois) ruled that the trial court should have considered granting defendant sentencing credit for his time on probation. The State of Illinois appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the entry of defendant's guilty plea, the State mistakenly advised the trial court that defendant had one prior felony conviction when defendant actually had two prior felony convictions. Defendant was thus ineligible for probation. Subsequently, defendant was convicted and sentenced to a term of prison. He contended that he was entitled to receive credit for the time he had spent on probation. The state supreme court found that the appellate court's order amounted to an unauthorized use of supervisory power under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615(b) and Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 16. Additionally, while 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-7(b) (2004) did confer a mandatory right to sentencing credit, it conferred that right only upon individuals who spent time either in custody, in home detention, in psychiatric confinement, or in substance abuse treatment. Therefore, defendant did not qualify for the mandatory credit. Furthermore, the court could not make laws under Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. Finally, neither defendant's equal protection rights, nor his double jeopardy rights under U.S. Const. amend. V and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 were violated by defendant not receiving the credit.</SPAN></P>

The State learned that defendant had two prior convictions and moved to vacate defendant's guilty plea, asserting that the sentence was void. Defendant was convicted at trial and was sentenced to eight years' incarceration. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court should have considered whether he should receive credit for the time he spent on probation. The appellate court agreed on grounds of fundamental fairness. The supreme court held that neither 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-8-7(b) (2004) nor 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-6-4(h) (2004) allowed for any discretion to award credit for time spent on probation when defendant was subsequently sentenced to incarceration when the original sentence was illegal.

The appellate court found that, although the grandmother testified, inter alia, that the child loved her, she presented no evidence that denial of visitation with her would harm the child's mental, physical, or emotional health. The only evidence relating to such harm came from the mother, who testified that the denial of visitation to the grandmother was not harmful to the child. The trial court found there was no &quot;direct emotional harm&quot; to the child in denying visitation to the grandmother. Neither denial of an opportunity for grandparent visitation, nor a child never knowing a grandparent was &quot;harm&quot; that rebutted the 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/607(a-5)(3) (2006) presumption that a fit parent's denial of a grandparent's visitation was not harmful to the child's mental, physical, or emotional health.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurance company (insurer), a Canadian corporation, challenged a judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court, affirming a circuit court judgment finding the Illinois retaliatory tax (215 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/444 (2006)) on alien corporations constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This appeal raised three issues: whether the retaliatory tax violated the uniformity clause of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970)); whether the U.S. Congress, through the McCarran-Ferguson Act (15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1012 (2000)), authorized Illinois to impose a retaliatory tax upon the insurer; and, if not, whether the tax violated the so-called Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution (U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3). The supreme court found the tax was not prohibited by the uniformity clause, as all foreign and alien insurance companies had to pay the tax, regardless of their origin, and its legitimate purpose of equalizing tax burdens between states barred the insurer's challenge. The plain language of the Act imposed no limitation on the imposition of the tax. The Act provided that there would not be any barrier on the regulation of every person involved in the &quot;business of insurance, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1011, 1012(a) (2000). The supreme court read this to mean that alien insurers were within the ambit of the Act. Congress removed all Commerce Clause limitations on states' authority to regulate and tax the insurance business when it passed the Act.</SPAN></P>

The State moved to dismiss the petition as untimely. Petitioner's counsel claimed that the time for filing the postconviction petition did not start running until after the appellate court's decision and essentially concluded that petitioner was not culpably negligent for the delay in filing the petition. The trial court, however, dismissed the petition as untimely filed. The appellate court vacated upon finding counsel failed to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c). On further review, the state supreme court found that petitioner's counsel complied with Ill. Sup. Ct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Attorney General of Illinois and a former wife, challenged a judgment of an appellate court (Illinois), which reversed a trial court judgment imposing statutory penalties under 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 28/35 (2004) against appellee, the employer of the wife's former husband, for failure to timely turn over child support payments withheld from the husband's wages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer argued that the Withholding Act was unconstitutional as applied to him, depriving him of his due process rights under both U.S. Const., amend. XIV and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970). The trial court applied the statutory $ 100-per-day penalty, resulting in a judgment for $ 1,172,100. The appellate court held that the statutory penalty, as applied in the instant case, was unconstitutionally severe. Reversing the appellate court's judgment, the court held that the statute did not violate the employer's substantive due process rights. A state's interest in the support of children was compelling. Further, as applied to the employer, the statute was not unconstitutional. During the two and a half year period relevant to the litigation, the employer violated the Withholding Act on 11,721 separate occasions. The employer was aware of his statutory obligations and of the penalty. Nonetheless, he repeatedly and knowingly violated the statute. Because the employer controlled the extent of the penalty, he could not complain that the penalty was harsh when compared to the amount of child support at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of two counts of first degree murder by the trial court. His conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Court (Illinois). He had argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred when it sua sponte raised a reverse-Batson challenge to his use of a peremptory challenge during jury selection and that the imposition of his extended-term sentence violated the rule announced in Apprendi. He again appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During jury selection, defense counsel questioned a juror who worked at a hospital which was known for treating gunshot victims. The judge prohibited defendant from using a peremptory challenge to reject the juror. The Illinois Supreme Court held the judge improperly used counsel's response to his command as a basis for finding a prima facie case of discrimination. The record did not support the action taken by the trial court. Since women outnumbered men on the venire two to one, it would not be unusual, from a statistical standpoint, that defendant had used peremptory challenges against two women and one man prior to consideration of the juror at issue. The fact that she had frequent contact with gunshot victims seemed to a valid reason why defense counsel might want to excuse her, and defense counsel's questioning revealed nothing of a discriminatory nature. However, the evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming, and the error in denying defendant's peremptory challenge was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The Apprendi violation was also harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower appellate court was affirmed, though not the entirety of its analysis, insofar as that judgment affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family resided in Michigan. The father obtained a riding lawn tractor from the retailer in Michigan. The retailer was a New York corporation domiciled in Illinois and made certain decisions regarding the design of the riding lawn tractor, product testing, distribution of that product, and investigations involving injuries caused by the product in Illinois. The father was mowing his lawn in Michigan using the riding lawn tractor. He did not see his minor son, who was less than four-years-old, walk up behind the riding lawn tractor. The father then backed up and ran over the minor son with the riding lawn tractor. The family sued the retailer in Illinois, alleged strict products liability and negligence claims, and moved to apply Illinois law to the liability and damages issues. The trial court ruled that Illinois law applied to those substantive issues and the appellate court agreed. On further review, the state supreme court found that Illinois' relationship to the case was not so pivotal as to overcome the presumption that Michigan, as the state where the injury occurred and the family resided, was the state with the most significant relationship to the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police officer applied for a disability pension with defendant City of North Chicago Police Pension Board. The officer's counsel requested limited consideration for a duty-related disability pension only under 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-114.1 (2002). The Board denied the officer a line-of-duty pension. The circuit court confirmed the Board's decision. The appellate court (Illinois) upheld the Board's decision. The officer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer, who had prior knee problems, suffered a new injury to his knee while transporting a prisoner. The evidence adduced in the instant case included testimony from five doctors, four of whom found the officer to be disabled such that the officer was unable to perform in a full-duty capacity as a police officer. Two of those doctors specifically found that the subject injury aggravated the officer's preexisting condition, rendering him disabled. The sole doctor who opined that the officer was not disabled for full duty as a police officer provided no factual basis for his conclusion that the tears to the officer's knee that were treated by another doctor were a preexisting disease and not traumatic tears caused by a new injury. Other than his opinion, there was no medical evidence whatsoever to support a finding that the officer was not disabled for full duty as a police officer, and there was abundant medical evidence that the officer was disabled. The supreme court further concluded that it was not necessary for all three of the Board-selected physicians to concur and that the credible assessments of two of three Board-appointed physicians supported a pension award.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments of the circuit and appellate courts were reversed, the decision of the Board was set aside, and the cause was remanded to the Board with directions that it grant the employee a line-of-duty pension in accordance with 40 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile was adjudicated delinquent for the unauthorized possession or storage of a weapon under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/21-6 (2004). The trial court accepted the juvenile's guilty plea and sentenced him to 12 months of probation and other conditions. Nearly one year later, the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) granted the juvenile's motion to vacate the delinquency finding. Petitioner State sought a writ of mandamus or prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court exceeded its authority when it vacated the delinquency finding over 11 months after the juvenile pled guilty and was sentenced for the offense. The supreme court held that the delinquency finding was not subject to modification 11 months after the juvenile was sentenced to probation. While the juvenile sentencing disposition was a final and appealable order and the trial court retained jurisdiction to modify the sentencing disposition and wardship, nothing in the Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987 gave the trial court the authority to modify the finding of delinquency once the disposition became final and appealable. The supreme court further noted that 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1401 (2004) petitions were applicable to juvenile cases and that Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d) strictly applied to juvenile cases. The juvenile did not file a petition under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-1401 (2004), nor did he file a motion to vacate his guilty plea under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d). In addition, the order vacating the delinquency finding interfered with the statutory scheme for expungement of juvenile law enforcement and court records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writ of prohibition was allowed and the trial court was directed to reinstate the finding of delinquency against the juvenile and to vacate the portion of its order that vacated the juvenile's delinquency finding.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court denied the parents' motion to dismiss and held the parents in indirect civil contempt for failing to follow the order.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother sought to enforce an order agreed to between the grandmother and the parents which allowed her to visit her granddaughter.

The state supreme court found that because the parents could no longer compel the daughter to visit the grandmother, the rationale for the civil contempt order in the case was lost. When such a situation occurred, the appropriate disposition of the case was to vacate the judgments of the lower courts and remand the cause with instructions to dismiss because the issues raised in the contempt proceedings were necessarily moot. Similarly, the issues presented by the circuit court's ruling on the grandmother's petition to enforce the agreed visitation order were also moot because the courts could not force the granddaughter, who was then an adult, to visit the grandmother. As with the contempt proceedings, the cause was to be remanded to the circuit court with instructions to dismiss the petition to enforce.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Act 89-685 (1997), amending the state's administrative review law, was unconstitutional. The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant applied to the retirement fund for temporary disability benefits; the retirement fund denied the application. The claimant appealed to the retirement fund's board of trustees, which adopted as its final decision its committee's recommendation that the application be denied. The claimant then filed a complaint for administrative review of the denial of her claim. The complaint named the retirement fund as the sole defendant. The retirement fund moved to dismiss because the claimant did not name the board of trustees as a defendant. The trial court dismissed the complaint based on its ruling that Ill. Pub. Act 89-685 (1997), amending the state's administrative review law, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the state supreme court found that it did not need to address the constitutional issue because dismissal was required pursuant to 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-103(2) (2004) and 735 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant failed to appear after positing bond on the 1990 murder charge. He was arrested in 2000 on an outstanding warrant. On appeal, defendant argued that the admission of the 1991 testimony of a deceased eyewitness, given in a codefendant's trial, violated defendant's Confrontation Clause rights. The trial court found the testimony admissible under 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/115-10.4 (2004). The appellate court reversed on the constitutional issue, holding that its decision rendered the issue of the admissibility under &sect; 115-10.4 moot. The supreme court vacated that judgment. Courts were to avoid reaching constitutional issues if rulings could be made on another basis. In the instant case, the appellate court should have first determined if the trial court's evidentiary ruling was erroneous. If so, the next question was whether the error was harmless. If the ruling was erroneous and was not harmless, the case would end and defendant would be entitled to a new trial. Only if the trial court's &sect; 115-10.4 ruling was not erroneous, or was erroneous but harmless as an evidentiary matter, should the appellate court have turned to the constitutional challenge to the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's judgment was vacated and the cause was remanded to the appellate court with directions that the court first consider the nonconstitutional issues raised, reaching the constitutional issues only if necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Court for the Second District (Illinois) entered a judgment that affirmed defendant's convictions for attempted murder, armed robbery, home invasion, and criminal damage to property, and the related sentences for home invasion and criminal damage to property, but vacated defendant's sentences for attempted murder and armed robbery. The state supreme court granted defendant's petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a codefendant broke into a residence, confronted a man and his wife, demanded a safe, and fired their weapons. Two shots hit the man. Defendant and the codefendant fled, and took a lockbox with them. The codefendant later pled guilty to charges against him and testified against defendant. Defendant was tried before a jury. He was convicted of attempted murder, armed robbery, home invasion, and criminal damage to property. On appeal, the appellate court vacated his nonenhanced sentenced for attempted murder and directed the trial court to add a mandatory 15-year enhancement for weapon possession. It also vacated his armed robbery sentence. On further review, the state supreme court found that in light of its recent Sharpe decision, which was decided while defendant's case was pending on review, the 15-year enhancement could be added to the attempted murder sentence, that such an enhancement to the armed robbery sentence would make that sentence disproportionate to the offense of armed violence predicated on robbery with a certain type of weapon, and that defendant's heavier sentence when compared with that of his codefendant was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's judgment vacating defendant's nonenhanced sentence for attempted murder and directing the trial court to add the mandated 15-year sentence to the new base sentence was affirmed. Its judgment vacating defendant's sentence for armed robbery was affirmed, but its resentencing directive on remand was reversed with directions. Otherwise, the appellate court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision of an appellate court (Illinois), which ruled that the Sex Offender Registration Act, 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/1 et seq. (2000) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Defendant had been convicted of aggravated kidnapping of a grandmother and granddaughter and had been required to register as a sex offender under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the definition of a sex offense in 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/2(B)(1.5) (2000) was unconstitutional as applied to him because the aggravated kidnapping of the granddaughter was not sexually motivated. The supreme court reversed,  finding first that amendments to the Act while the State's appeal was pending that, inter alia, changed the definition of &quot;sex offense&quot; to include only sexually motivated aggravated kidnappings of a minor by a non-parent, did not preclude review of the constitutional issue presented. The pre-amendment version of &sect; 2(B)(1.5) satisfied the rational basis test. The Act's purpose of assisting law enforcement and protecting the public was a legitimate state interest. The state legislature chose to include aggravated kidnapping of a minor by a non-parent in the definition of a sex offense, and, consequently, to impose a registration requirement under the Act on persons convicted of such an offense, regardless of whether their conduct was sexually motivated. The decision was a reasonable one that satisfied the second prong of the rational basis test. Thus, the Act was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court vacated a finding by the appellate court that the aggravated kidnapping was not sexually motivated. The supreme court then reversed the appellate court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for issuance of an Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 604(d) certificate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed as of right after an appellate court (Illinois) ruled that the 15-year mandatory sentencing enhancement for aggravated criminal sexual assault while armed with a firearm found in 720 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of eight counts of criminal sexual assault and two counts of home invasion. He was sentenced to consecutive terms of 21 years' imprisonment on four of the sexual assault convictions. Before reaching the proportionate penalties clause argument, the appellate court vacated defendant's convictions and remanded for determination of whether a Crawford violation occurred and whether defendant forfeited his right to confrontation by wrongdoing. The State's sole contention was that the appellate court erred in finding the sentencing provision unconstitutional. The supreme court agreed. Ruling on the sentencing provision's constitutionality was unnecessary as it could not be assumed that defendant would be convicted again on remand. If defendant was not convicted of the offenses, he would never be subject to sentencing under the 15-year firearm penalty enhancement. Thus, it was unnecessary for the appellate court to address the constitutional issue and declare &sect; 12-14(d)(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The appellate court should have declined to address the constitutional issue after vacating defendant's convictions and remanding for a hearing on forfeiture by wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court granted the State's petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was in prison serving a 28-year sentence for attempted murder of a police officer, a crime he committed in 1997 at the age of 16.

Years later, he filed a successive petition for post-conviction relief, which the trial court summarily denied. The appellate court reversed and remanded for a new transfer hearing in accordance with the law currently in effect. On further, the state supreme court found that the issue presented by his case was whether he should be granted postconviction relief on the grounds that the statute under which he was transferred from juvenile custody to criminal court, and subsequently sentenced, was declared invalid in Cervantes. The state supreme court found that he was entitled to relief because the invalidity of the statute meant that it was though the statute had never been enacted. The state supreme court then found that the law in effect at the time of the transfer decision, absent that statute because it was invalid, had to be applied and that defendant might be entitled to relief as a result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grandparents appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Peoria County (Illinois), which found that the statute governing grandparent visitation, &sect; 607(a-5) of the Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, 750 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/607(a-5) (Supp. 2005), was facially unconstitutional and dismissed a visitation petition. Appellee mother had sought dismissal of the petition under both 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-615 and 2-619 (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court allowed the Illinois Attorney General to intervene. The Attorney General argued that the trial court improperly ruled on the constitutionality of the statute when nonconstitutional grounds were available. The supreme court agreed. Illinois courts were to address constitutional issues only as a last resort. The trial court ruled on the 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-619 (2004) motion without first addressing the facial sufficiency of the grandparents' petition under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/2-615 (2004).  The supreme court rejected the mother's argument that there was a tacit denial of the &sect;&nbsp;2-615 motion. There was no support in the record for that argument, and the supreme court would not presume an implicit denial of the &sect;&nbsp;2-615 motion. The supreme court also rejected the notion that the mother's fundamental parental rights were infringed upon by the filing of the visitation petition by the grandparents. Nothing in the Lulay decision categorically forbid litigation requiring a parental response because it constituted a significant interference with the fundamental rights of parents.</SPAN></P>

The election board however concluded that 65 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3.1-10-5(b) was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate's first postconviction petition, alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel, was dismissed as untimely. The appellate court affirmed. The inmate filed a pro se petition, alleging that the statute under which he was sentenced violated Apprendi. The circuit court appointed counsel, who filed a supplemental petition. That petition was dismissed. The appellate court (Illinois) affirmed. The inmate was granted leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that the appellate court erred in finding that postconviction counsel's failure to comply with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c) constituted harmless error. The State argued that application of harmless error review was appropriate because counsel could do nothing to shape defendant's noncognizable Apprendi claim into a meritorious issue. The supreme court held that the appellate court erred in applying a harmless error analysis where no compliance with Rule 651(c) was shown. The supreme court noted that compliance had to be shown regardless of whether the claims made in the pro se or amended petition were viable. The supreme court's analysis was driven by the conviction that where postconviction counsel does not adequately complete the duties mandated by the rule, the limited right to counsel conferred by the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/122-1 et seq. (2000), could not be fully realized.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Existing car dealerships filed a protest against proposed dealerships with appellee State of Illinois Motor Vehicle Review Board, pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Franchise Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 710/1 et seq. (2004). Appellants, a manufacturer and a new dealership, appealed. The appellate court (Illinois) affirmed. The manufacturer and the new dealership appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer sought to add two dealerships within the existing dealerships' relevant market area. On appeal, the manufacturer argued that the Board did not apply the &quot;good cause&quot; standard correctly. The supreme court disagreed, noting that the legislature intended that the Board balance the dealer's interest in maintaining viable businesses, the manufacturer's interest in promoting sales, and the public's interest in adequate competition and convenient sales. The supreme court further concluded that the Board's decision was not clearly erroneous, noting that there was unrebutted testimony establishing that the existing dealerships had made substantial investments in the dealerships, the existing dealerships had adequate sales and service facilities, and there was no evidence that the existing dealerships had materially breached their franchise agreements. The manufacturer also argued, inter alia, that the Act violated the Commerce Clause by improperly favoring purely local interests. The supreme court found that the Act passed muster under the Pike test because any burden the Act placed on interstate commerce was not clearly excessive in relation to the local benefits.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court initially affirmed the circuit court's judgment, finding that although the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the out-of-court statements, the error was harmless in light of the other evidence offered in the case. Upon rehearing, the appellate court reversed the trial court's finding of delinquency, based on defendant's confrontation clause claim. It then went on to address the constitutionality of &sect; 115-10 under Crawford and the confrontation clause. The state supreme court found that not only did the appellate court's latter ruling violate the prohibition in Ill. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee juvenile admitted guilt to a probation violation, the Cook County Circuit Court (Illinois) sua sponte declared 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/5-710(1)(a)(iv) (2004) of the Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987 and 20 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/5(l) (2004) of the Illinois Children and Family Services Act unconstitutional under the Proportionate Penalties Clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The State appealed; appellee cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At appellee's dispositional hearing after his admission of guilt, the trial court determined that it could not place him with the county because, due a lack of funds, the county had ordered a freeze ordered on all further juvenile placements. Further, it could not order residential placement through the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) because 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/5-710(1)(a)(iv) and 20 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/5(l) did not allow DCFS to accept guardianship of delinquent minors over age 13. The trial court held that those provisions violated the Proportionate Penalties Clause due to their disparate treatment of delinquent minors under and over age 13. The high court disagreed. Because a petition for adjudication of wardship was not a direct action by the State to inflict punishment, neither the Proportionate Penalties Clause nor the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause applied. The county's failure to appropriate reasonable funds to care for delinquent minors might violate 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/6-7(1) (2004), but that did not mean that &sect; 6-7(1), 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 6-8(2) (2004), or 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. 405/5-710(1)(a)(iv) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court, which was free to fashion any disposition consistent with statutory directives. Appellee's request to terminate his wardship was denied, but the trial court was free to grant that relief since appellee was no longer a minor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State was granted an appeal as of right to challenge the judgment of the appellate court (Illinois), which held that the monetary charge assessed against defendant, pursuant to 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-9-1.1(c) (2004), was unconstitutional and that several other charges were satisfied by credit from presentencing incarceration. Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not challenge his conviction of his sentence of two years' imprisonment on appeal. As such, the court noted that the appeal only involved the issues arising from the monetary charges imposed by the trial court. The trial court relied directly on two case law precedents in holding that the Trauma Fund Spinal Cord charge under &sect; 5/5-9-1.1(c) was unconstitutional and that the drug assessment under 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 570/411.2(a)(4) (2004), was subject to offset by the presentencing incarceration credit. The trial court also held that defendant was entitled to credit against the $ 4 Criminal/Traffic Conviction Surcharge under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-9-1(c-9) (2004), and the $ 100 Trauma Fund charge under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-9-1.1(b) (2004), which the appellate court also found were fines. The court agreed that the various charges against defendant were fines subject to offset. The court disagreed that the $ 5 charge under 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-9-1.1(c) (2004) violated defendant's substantive due process since the fine was not grossly disproportionate and was rationally related to the offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, in part, the judgment of the appellate court as to its determination that the Traffic and Criminal Conviction Surcharge, the drug assessment, and the Trauma Fund charge were subject to offset for presentencing incarceration credit. Accordingly, defendant was entitled to a credit of $ 604. The court reversed the appellate court's determination that the Trauma Fund Spinal Cord statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a travel agency and its owner, were granted leave to appeal the judgment of the appellate court (Illinois), which affirmed a trial court judgment in their favor but also affirmed an order striking their fee petition. Plaintiff traveler cross-appealed. Plaintiff's suit alleged breach of contract and violations of the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/1 et seq. (2004).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suit arose from plaintiff's dissatisfaction with a safari trip to East Africa, which was arranged by defendants. The trip was befallen by heavy rains and, upon return, plaintiff demanded a refund from defendants, which defendants refused to do. After a bench trial, the judgment was entered in favor of defendants, but defendants' fee petition, seeking fees and costs over $ 30,000 was stricken upon the trial court determining that defendants failed to satisfy the requirements of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 137 in that defendant failed to allege any false statements by plaintiff and no bad faith was shown entitling them to an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party under 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 505/10a(c) (2004). The court held that where a prevailing defendant petitions the trial court for a reasonable attorney fee under &sect; 10a(c), only if the trial court makes a threshold finding that the plaintiff acted in bad faith should the trial court consider other circumstances relevant to its exercise of discretion. Further, defendants failed to demonstrate any bad faith under the requirements of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 137 to entitle them to an award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company filed suit against defendant union alleging that the union picketed a company's work site with placards containing false information. The trial court ruled in favor of the union and the appellate court, Illinois, reversed. On remand, the trial court awarded the company compensatory and punitive damages. The appellate court reduced the punitive damages award. The instant court granted the parties' petitions for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union argued that the appellate court erred in affirming the trial court's punitive damages award, as the damages imposed were unconstitutionally excessive in violation of due process. The company countered that the appellate court erred in reducing the punitive damages award and asserted that it was entitled to a greater amount of punitive damages. The instant court first found that the appellate court erred in finding that the company was financially vulnerable. The instant court reasoned that the record contained no evidence that the company lost other contracts or was unable to perform excavating work at other locations as a result of the union's conduct. The instant court also found that it agreed with the appellate court's conclusion that the union acted with intentional malice. The facts of this case demonstrated that a business agent for the union either knew that the statements contained on his picket signs were false or, at the very least, seriously doubted their veracity. Finally, the instant court found that a punitive damages award of $ 325,000, at a ratio of approximately 75 to 1, was unconstitutionally excessive in light of the union's conduct in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the appellate court was reversed. The judgment of the circuit court was affirmed as modified by a reduction in the award of punitive damages from $ 325,000 to $ 50,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant made threats of bodily harm against the police chief while in therapy, and the applicant was placed on disability leave. The applicant then sought duty-related disability pension benefits. Three medical experts found that the applicant was disabled due to psychological disorders. The fourth doctor, to whom the applicant was referred by the Board, found that the applicant was not disabled and that the applicant was exaggerating his symptoms. The factual determination of the Board, that the applicant failed to satisfy his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for a disability pension under 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-114.1, 3-114.2 (2002), was not against the manifest weight of the evidence under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-110 (2002). The expert opinions conflicted as to whether the applicant was disabled, creating an issue of fact for the Board to resolve. The Board's resolution was supported by evidence in the record. The fourth doctor's report was replete with expressions of doubt as to whether the applicant suffered from a psychological disturbance and whether he was disabled, and these expressions were supported by specific references to the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After separate bench trials, defendants were convicted of knowingly manufacturing more than 900 grams of a substance containing methamphetamine under 720 Ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Contrary to defendants' contention, the supreme court concluded that, for purposes of &sect; 401(a)(6.5)(D) of the Controlled Substances Act, codified at 720 Ill.

Accordingly, any byproduct containing traces of methamphetamine qualified as a &quot;substance containing methamphetamine.&quot; The supreme court further held that &sect; 401(a)(6.5)(D) did not violate the proportionate penalties clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, or the due process clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. Among other things, the supreme court noted that methamphetamine manufacturing was a dangerous process and thus, the sentencing category established by &sect;&nbsp;401(a)(6.5)(D) was not cruel or degrading or a shock to the moral sense of the community. In addition, that section was reasonably designed to remedy to particular evils the legislature was targeting. Finally, the supreme court hold that the search warrant at issue did not violate the warrant clause of the Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 or the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois appellate court entered a judgment that reversed appellant police pension board's (Board) denial of plaintiff former police officer's disability pension claim after the trial court had confirmed the Board's decision on administrative review. The appellate court also declared 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-115 (2002) unconstitutional as to him. The Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former police officer, who had problems with the police chief and who had been involved in a troubled relationship with a girlfriend, filed an application for a disability pension with the police pension board (Board). Following a hearing, the Board denied his application. The former police officer thereafter filed an action for administrative review in the trial court. The trial court ultimately confirmed the Board's decision. On appeal, the appellate court reversed the trial court's affirmance of the Board's decision to deny the former police officer a disability pension, and remanded the cause to the Board for further proceedings. In addition, the appellate court also declared 40 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/3-115 (2002), setting forth the procedure for obtaining a disability pension, unconstitutional as applied to the former police officer. On further review, the state supreme court disagreed with the appellate court's reversal of the Board's decision because it found the Board's decision denying the application not to be against the manifest weight of the evidence. As a result, it found that it was unnecessary to determine whether the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's judgment that reversed the Board's denial of the former police officer's disability pension claim was reversed. Also, the portion of the appellate court's judgment holding a section of the Pension Code unconstitutional as applied to the former police officer was vacated. Too, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Court of Illinois held that Chicago, Ill., Mun. Code &sect; 4-60-140(d) did not violate either the federal or the Illinois Constitution. The Court therefore reversed the circuit court's contrary judgment and remanded for further proceedings with respect to both appellant corporation's license revocation and the city's public nuisance claim. The court granted the corporation's petition for leave to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether this ordinance violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments and Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 4 (1970). The supreme court found that under the four-part test articulated in Ben's Bar, &sect; 4-60-140(d) did not offend the First Amendment, as it was directed toward the regulation of alcohol sales and consumption in inappropriate locations, a matter within the city's general police powers. The experience of the city and other jurisdictions showed that the secondary harms to which &sect; 4-60-140(d) were addressed were real and not merely conjectural. Section 4-60-140(d) was tailored precisely to its objective: combating the negative secondary effects flowing from the combination of nude or seminude dancing and alcohol sales. The corporation's argument that &sect; 14-60-140(d) was invalid under Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 4 was rejected. Because the ordinance did not violate either the U.S. or the Illinois Constitution, the circuit court erred in concluding that the ordinance could not serve as the predicate for revoking the corporation's liquor license revocation or enjoining its operation on the grounds that it constituted a public nuisance. The appellate court therefore acted properly.</SPAN></P>

That statute stated that the luring into a building of a child without parental consent was prima facie evidence of &quot;other than a lawful purpose.&quot; The indictments stated that defendant's conduct in luring them into his residence without the consent of the parents was unlawful given that the children were under 16 years old. The State later amended the indictments to include the statements that defendant acted &quot;for other than a lawful purpose.&quot; Defendant was convicted on all seven counts. On appeal, the appellate court reversed the convictions. On further review, the state supreme court found that the language that the luring shall be prima facie evidence of &quot;other than a lawful purpose&quot; was an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption but that the convictions were proper even absent the use of that presumption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault of a family member under the age of 18, was sentenced to four years' probation, and was required to register as a sex offender for 10 years. Defendant was charged with failure to register a change of address and giving a false address in his re-registration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was subject to the registration requirement of the Illinois Sex Offender Registration Act, the Act was amended such that any person subject to the registration requirement who failed to register a change of address within 10 days or failed to register annually was subject to an increase in his or her registration requirement of 10 years. Defendant argued that 730 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 150/7 (2004) and Ill. Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect; 1280.40 (2000) were unconstitutional because they did not require the state police to notify a registrant that he or she violated the Act, did not provide for notice of any proceeding where a registrant's period for reporting could be extended, did not provide a registrant with notice of the alleged reasons for the extension or with an opportunity to appear and contest the extension, and did not provide the registrant with notification that his or her registration period had been extended. The supreme court held that, as applied to defendant, the Act and Code satisfied due process. The Act and the Code clearly set forth defendant's duty to register, as well as defendant's responsibilities in the event defendant changed residence address.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the children of a decedent, filed a legal malpractice action against defendant attorney. The trial court granted the attorney's motion to dismiss the complaint. An Illinois appellate court reversed the dismissal and remanded the case. It held that 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-214.3(e) (2000) had not tolled the repose period for two plaintiffs, but found that there had been fraudulent concealment. The attorney appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's husband retained the attorney to pursue a medical malpractice/wrongful death action. The children were then minors. The court first held that &sect; 13-214.3(e) tolled the statutes of limitations and repose set forth in &sect; 13-214.3(b) and (c). Thus, the legal malpractice suit was timely filed as to two plaintiffs, but whether it had been timely filed as to the other two depended on fraudulent concealment under 735 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/13-215 (2000). There was no reason why &sect; 13-215 should not apply to statutes of repose. A fiduciary who failed to disclose material facts concerning the existence of a cause of action had fraudulently concealed that action. As the underlying action had been brought for the benefit of the children, the attorney had owed them a fiduciary duty. Here, the children alleged that the attorney had fraudulently concealed the facts supporting the legal malpractice cause of action by failing to advise of the true status of the case, by representing that the case was going very well, and by stating that there was no need to contact him more frequently about its status. These allegations, if proven, were sufficient to establish fraudulent concealment.</SPAN></P>

It reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Laws 94-727, which amended the Circuit Courts Act, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 35/1 et seq., unconstitutional. Appellant state elections board and its members appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two counties were divided into separate judicial circuits by the Illinois General Assembly. Thereafter, the state elections board decreed that five new judgeships were required, three in one county and two in the other. Appellant candidates seeking to fill the new judgeships filed for the primary election. Before the primary, the Illinois General Assembly passed a law, 2006 Ill. Laws 94-727, in which it erased three of the additional judgeships. The candidates sued, and claimed, inter alia, that the action of the Illinois General Assembly violated the state constitution's separation of powers clause because the state elections board, part of the executive branch, allegedly had the power to determine how many judges an area should have. The trial court found that the law, 2006 Ill. Laws 94-727, which amended the Circuit Courts Act, 705 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 35/1 et seq., was unconstitutional. On further review the state supreme court rejected the trial court's ruling. It found that the Illinois General Assembly had the constitutional authority to create a statute allowing for the creation of judgeships and, thus, likewise had the authority to rescind the creation of judgeships.</SPAN></P>

Ann. 200/23-10 (1998) of the Property Tax Code to various taxes, including a permanent road tax. Intervenor road district intervened and moved for summary judgment. The motion was granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the supreme court was whether 605 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-620 could be applied retroactively to validate the tax levy challenged by the taxpayers. If &sect;&nbsp;6-620 applied retroactively, the supreme court concluded that the authorization obtained in 1979 for the road tax levy did not expire and the challenged 1997 levy was not subject to challenge on the ground that it failed to comply with 60 Ill. Comp. stat. Ann. 1/30-20(b) (1998). The supreme court held that 605 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/6-620 could be applied retroactively. The statute cured the defects on which the taxpayers' challenge was based. No after-the-fact declaration of intent was made concerning the preamendatory law and no final judgment was disturbed. Prior to the instant action, the specific taxes at issue had been invalidated by a court of law. In addition, the taxes validated were not limited to plaintiff taxpayers. Thus, retroactive application of the curative statute was permissible and did not violate the principles of separation of powers or deprive the taxpayers of their rights to due process under the Illinois or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court reversed the appellate court's judgment because it no longer applied the cross-comparison analysis in proportionate penalties cases following its Sharpe decision. It also agreed with the appellate court that the statute applied equally to adult and juvenile offenders, and that the statute did not violate the minor's due process rights. Also, the state supreme court found that the minor had standing to raise the due process challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pike County Circuit Court (Illinois) denied the State's motion for admission of evidence, which effectively found that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/104-25(a) was unconstitutional, where defendant was charged with drug and alcohol-related crimes, he was found mentally unfit to stand trial and unlikely to be fit within one year, and the State moved for a discharge hearing under that statute to determine evidence sufficiency. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with various drug and alcohol-related offenses in four separate cases. Prior to trial, on his motion, the trial court found defendant mentally unfit to stand trial. It also found that there was no substantial probability that defendant would attain fitness within one year. The State moved for a discharge hearing pursuant to 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/104-25(a) (2004) to determine the sufficiency of the evidence against defendant. The State also moved, pursuant to that section, for the admission of certain evidence. The trial court denied the State's motion for admission of evidence, effectively finding 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/104-25(a) (2004) unconstitutional. On appeal, the state supreme court found that 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/104-25(a) (2004) was constitutional. It found that a discharge hearing was a civil proceeding, and, thus, defendant's confrontation clause rights were not implicated. It also found that due process in regard to a discharge proceeding did not protect him like it would in a criminal trial, and, thus, his constitutional rights were not violated by that statute allowing the admission of hearsay or affidavit evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the cause was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Illinois Highway Code, 605 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/4-510 (2004), authorized the state transportation agency to prepare and record maps that established the approximate locations and widths of rights of way for future state highway system additions. Pursuant to that statute, the state transportation agency prepared and recorded a map that set forth a right-of-way for a proposed highway. The property owners, whose property fell within the right-of-way, filed an action for declaratory judgment, seeking to have that statute declared unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the complaint, primarily because it believed that the property owners lacked standing. On appeal, the appellate court reversed the trial court's judgment that property owners lacked standing, but rejected their constitutional arguments on the merits. On further review and since the state transportation agency conceded that there was standing, the state supreme court found that only the constitutionality of the statute remained as an issue and further ruled that the statute did not violate the federal takings clause, state separation of powers principles, or substantive due process principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the U.S. Supreme Court, the court reconsidered issues related to defendant's case, in which he was convicted of cannabis trafficking by an Illinois circuit court after a trained dog alerted to the presence of marijuana in the trunk of defendant's car. The appellate court affirmed, and the instant court reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was asked to reconsider its long-standing position, known as the &quot;limited lockstep doctrine,&quot; that the search and seizure clause of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 (1970) should be interpreted in the same manner as the virtually identical search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment. The court reaffirmed its commitment to limited lockstep analysis not only because it felt constrained to do so by the doctrine of stare decisis, but because the limited lockstep approach continued to reflect the court's understanding of the intent of the framers of the Illinois Constitution of 1970. Defendant argued that, notwithstanding the United States Supreme Court's interpretation of the search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment, the court should consider a canine sniff to be a &quot;search,&quot; within the meaning of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. However, in light of the continued adherence to the lockstep doctrine, albeit with some room for flexibility, defendant had not made a case for an exception to the lockstep doctrine. Given the limited lockstep approach to search and seizure analysis, the sniff did not violate defendant's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
