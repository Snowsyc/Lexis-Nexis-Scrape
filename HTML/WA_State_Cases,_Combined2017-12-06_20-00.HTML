</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found to be a sexually violent predator under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 71.09 and committed to a special commitment center. Years later, he filed a pro se petition for unconditional discharge. The Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington) denied defendant's petition for unconditional discharge, concluding that the State presented proof that he continued to meet the requirement for commitment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090(2)(b) violated due process by allowing the State to rely solely on the annual report to show that he continued to meet the definition of a sexually violent predator. The appellate court disagreed, holding that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090(2)(b) permitted the State to rely on annual reports without presenting additional evidence at the show cause hearing. The statute did not violate due process because existing show cause hearing procedures sufficiently minimized the risk of an erroneous deprivation of defendant's liberty interest, and the probable value of cross-examination at a show cause hearing was minimal. Defendant had sufficient avenues at his disposal to gather evidence to show that his condition had &quot;so changed&quot; that total commitment was no longer warranted. While cross-examination of the State's experts at a show cause hearing could conceivably have elicited information helpful to defendant, he could do the same thing by using the civil discovery rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington, granted respondent school district summary dismissal, holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction in appellant tutors' action concerning their continuing contract rights with the school district. The trial court found that the tutors did not appeal the school district's decision on their contract rights within 30 days as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.645.010. The tutors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tutors claimed that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.645.010 did not apply to them, but even if it did, they substantially complied with it. In the alternative, they argued that the 30-day statute was unconstitutional. The appellate court noted that if the tutors were categorized as employees, they were entitled to a continuing contract. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.405.010 applied to actions styled as declaratory judgment suits in which the litigant sought a favorable construction of statutory terms involving their employment benefits. The tutors' filing on July 11, 2003 was untimely as the contracts were signed on June 9, 2003; the 30 days would expire on July 9. The statute did not treat district employees and non-employees differently. It was not unlike any appellate rule that limited the time for appeal. The tutors had no property interest at stake. The legislature did not provide a specific right to have notice of the appeal requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 28A.645.010. The school district's failure to notify the tutors that they had to appeal its decision within the 30-day period required by the statute did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Thurston County, Washington, convicted defendant, pursuant to a guilty plea, of first degree incest. The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court previously remanded for the sentencing court to supplement the record with the presentence investigation (PSI) report and to determine whether defendant's unscored misdemeanor convictions warranted an exceptional sentence. Defendant argued that his exceptional sentence was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the sentencing court relied on an unproven fact to support the exceptional sentence. Neither Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.090 nor Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.68A explicitly defined &quot;immoral purposes&quot; or &quot;communicates,&quot; but case law held that &quot;immoral purposes&quot; referred to sexual misconduct and &quot;communicates&quot; included conduct as well as words. Because defendant's conduct leading to the prior conviction could have involved a broad range of conduct, the sentencing court's finding that he had sex with a minor was never proven nor admitted. The sentence court improperly relied on facts not necessarily proven at the prior adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded for resentencing within the standard range.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which convicted him of child molestation in the first degree and sentenced him to life in prison with no parole under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act (POAA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.94A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of child molestation in the first degree and was sentenced to life in prison with no parole under the POAA. He had three prior convictions: two counts of indecent liberties and one count of assault in the second-degree with sexual motivation, all committed against boys. He alleged prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, and challenges the POAA on several constitutional bases, but the court affirmed on appeal. Assuming without deciding that the prosecutor's comments in question were improper, defendant failed to show that they likely affected the jury's verdict. In addition, he did not show that the comments about defense counsel &quot;confusing&quot; the child witness were so flagrant and ill-intentioned that a curative instruction would have been useless. Counsel was not ineffective pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. VI because the evidence sought to be admitted was properly excluded since it was irrelevant, improper, and beyond the scope of a detective's testimony. His sentence was neither cruel nor unusual because he was a repeat offender who had been convicted of indecent acts against four different young boys.</SPAN></P>

Date filed: 11/07/2003.  <BR>Bergen Indus. &amp; Fishing Corp. v. Joint Stock Holding Co., 126 Wn. App. 1039, 2005 Wash. App. LEXIS 1281 (2005)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent corporation, a judgment creditor, registered its foreign judgment and used procedures in Wash. Rev. Code ch. 6.27 to obtain several ex parte, post-judgment writs of garnishment. One of these was served on a Seattle bank that held funds for the judgment debtor in the name of a third party, appellant company. The Superior Court of King County, Washington, awarded half the frozen funds to the corporation. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the company contended, inter alia, that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.27.060 was unconstitutional and that the lower court impermissibly stayed an order and granted an injunction. The appellate court found that the company had no standing to make its constitutional challenge as it was not an aggrieved party. Although the trial court concluded that the company and the judgment debtor were not the same legal entity, it had the power to issue a stay of execution on its judgment. At the time the trial court granted the company's summary judgment motion, there was significant evidence in the record that some or all of the funds in the company's garnished accounts were actually the property of the judgment debtor. There was not &quot;judgment&quot; against the company in favor of the corporation as the corporation's claim was that the company was in possession of the judgment debtor's funds, and that the corporation was the judgment creditor. No alternative remedy of a suit at law was present because the corporation was not suing the company on the basis of the company's personal obligations to the corporation. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the injunction.</SPAN></P>

Respondent, the Department of Social and Health Services, was also involved in the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was required to pay monthly child support. Following his accumulation of past-due child support debt of over $ 50,000, the Department of Social and Health Services Division of Child Support notified the father of his noncompliance and the resulting suspension of his driver's license under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 74.20A. An administrative law judge heard his challenge to the suspension and entered an order concluding that the father failed to comply with the child support order and upholding the license suspension. Recognizing that the father did not dispute that the license was properly suspended under state law, the trial court affirmed, holding that the father's constitutional claims were barred under collateral estoppel and res judicata. The trial court noted the father's claims would also fail on the merits. The father appealed. The court affirmed. The court held that each of his constitutional claims had been addressed on the merits by other courts and there was no authority that the court had to review the trial court and appellate records before applying res judicata or collateral estoppel. In addition, the court noted that &sect; 74.20A provided procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's severance motions. The first child victim met all the factors for competency because she was able to (1) accurately testify as to her age, her living arrangements, and the city where she lived; (2) respond appropriately to a truth/lie example; and (3) understand her obligation to tell the truth; thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding her competent to testify. In addition, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of first degree child molestation of the second victim because she testified she was lying on the couch with her eyes closed when defendant put his hand under her shirt and touched her chest for a few seconds. Also, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for first degree child rape because the third victim testified at trial that she was six years old when he put his hands down her pants and felt around inside.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Kitsap County (Washington) convicted defendant, upon his guilty pleas, of two counts of first degree rape, one count of first degree burglary with sexual motivation, five counts of first degree kidnapping, and one count of second degree assault. Based on the aggravating factors, the trial court sentenced him to serve a maximum term of life with a determinate minimum term of 651 months. Defendant appealed from his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that defendant waived his right to have a jury determine his guilt by knowingly and voluntarily pleading guilty to the crimes with which he had been charged. Defendant's convictions were based on his unchallenged and constitutionally valid plea and he was sentenced to life as Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.712(3) specifically required. However, defendant was not otherwise eligible to receive a minimum sentence in excess of the standard range until a jury found the disputed aggravating facts on which the trial court relied beyond a reasonable doubt, specifically, deliberate cruelty, victim vulnerability, and criminal sophistication. Therefore, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.712(3) did not give the trial court the authority to impose a minimum term in excess of the 384 to 511 month standard range without satisfying Blakely's jury trial requirement. Because the jury did not find those aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and because defendant did not admit to those factors, under Blakely, the trial court's exceptional sentence imposing a minimum term sentence of 651 months on defendant had to be vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's plea-based convictions, but remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted in the Superior Court of King County, Washington, for third-degree domestic violence assault and the trial court entered a no-contact order pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.99.050. Thereafter, he was convicted for domestic violence fourth-degree assault and felony violation of the no-contact order and the trial court imposed another no-contact order. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the original no-contact order was based on a facially unconstitutional statute and that the second no-contact order based on a violation of that order was void. Specifically, he contended that the statute unconstitutionally allowed prohibition of direct and indirect contact between him and the victim, effectively cutting off his ability to have contact with his children. The appellate court noted that a statute was facially unconstitutional only if there was no set of circumstances in which it could be constitutionally applied. The appellate court found that the no-contact order did not restrict contact between defendant and his children, and that defendant did not maintain that there was no set of circumstances in which the statute could be constitutionally applied. The appellate court held that the prohibition of all other contact was reasonably related to the goal of preventing further harm to the victim and the original order on which the no-contact order was based was issued pursuant to a valid statute and was not void; therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the no-contact order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, granting partial summary judgment in favor of respondent, Pierce County, Washington, concerning a lease agreement of tidelands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company contacted the Pierce County Department of Parks and Recreation concerning an interest in leasing tidelands the County owned. The company engaged in aquaculture and wanted to lease approximately 47 acres of submerged tidelands. The tidelands at issue were considered a public resource because they were one of a few places where the public could go to recreate and take shellfish for personal consumption. Eight months after the company began its operations on the leased property, the County began to question the validity of the lease and filed a complaint for declaratory relief declaring the lease null and void. The appellate court ruled that the lease was not ultra vires and the County could enter into such a contract for the first five-year period. However, the renewal clause that would have extended the contract for 30 years was prohibited by county ordinances requiring county council approval. Instead of invalidating the entire contract, the trial court should have severed the ultra vires portion. By exempting itself from Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.34, the County also exempted itself from Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.68, dealing with the management of county owned park lands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed in part, striking the renewal clause, and the case was remanded for trial as to whether the lease for the five-year term was a gift of public funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of first degree child rape.

Defendant argued that his guilty plea was invalid and should be withdrawn because the plea form and the trial court erroneously identified the standard sentencing range for his convictions. The State responded that defendant's challenge to his guilty plea was an untimely collateral attack that was procedurally barred under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090(1). Defendant's appeal was filed more than one year after the judgment and sentence became final, and challenged his plea's validity only after his SSOSA was revoked. The appellate court ruled that defendant's collateral attack was procedurally barred under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090(1) and not subject to any exception under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the King County Superior Court, Washington, which convicted him of felony violation of a domestic violence no-contact order. The State cross-appealed the determination of defendant's offender score.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued for the first time on appeal that the order prohibiting his contact with the child's mother had a consequence of precluding contact with his child, thus impermissibly interfering with his fundamental right to parent. Defendant claimed the statute authorizing the order, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.99.050, was unconstitutional on its face and that the resulting order was invalid. The instant court concluded that the order did not prohibit defendant from having contact with his child; it only prohibited contact with the child's mother. Therefore, defendant could not show that the statute would interfere with his right to parent, at least as constitutionally recognized. While the order may have been an inconvenience, any interference was not substantial or beyond that which was justified by the need to protect the mother. There was no violation of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial on whether the crime was a domestic violence offense. With respect to the State's cross-appeal, the sentencing court erred in determining that defendant's juvenile conviction for second degree assault &quot;washed-out,&quot; thereby reducing his offender score from four to three.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed. However, on the State's cross-appeal of the determination of defendant's offender score, the instant court reversed and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the exceptional sentencing statute was facially unconstitutional, that his waiver of a jury trial was not knowing and voluntary, that the trial court erred by considering acts unrelated to the charged offense in setting the sentence, and that the State violated its plea agreement by changing its sentencing recommendation. The appellate court noted that any argument concerning provisions relating to exceptional sentences as facially unconstitutional had been rejected. The plea agreement entered by defendant did not restrict consideration of the stipulated facts only for purposes of a standard range sentence. The trial court did not err by imposing an exceptional sentence upward based on the severity of the victim's injuries. The language of the plea agreement pointed to four triggers for withdrawal of the sentencing recommendation. The second trigger advised the defendant that criminal conduct resulting in arrest would jeopardize the sentencing recommendation, even if charges were not filed or a conviction had not been entered. Defendant's alleged criminal conduct was sufficient to relieve the State of the obligation to recommend the agreed sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the victim testified to multiple incidents but the trial court ruled that only one incident merited submission to the jury for child molestation, defendant argued that the jury could have convicted him based on one of the incidents dismissed by the trial court. During closing argument, the State elected the acts on which it relied, leaving no doubt that the jury's unanimous verdict was based on incidents supported by the evidence. Also, although the jury asked a question that seemingly signaled confusion as to which incidents the State elected, the appellate court could not assume that the confusion was not cleared up during the remainder of the jury's deliberations. Thus, his molestation conviction was not reversed. The appellate court found that sexual gratification was not an essential element of third degree child molestation. Thus, the trial court did not omit any essential element from the &quot;to convict&quot; jury instructions. Also, given the quantity and subject matter of the victim's testimony conceding her difficulties with defendant, even if the trial court erred in not permitting defendant to further cross-examine her on that subject, it was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his motion to suppress evidence was denied, defendant was convicted of unlawful manufacturing of methamphetamine in the Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington. Defendant appealed, asserting that the evidence used in support of his conviction was illegally obtained in a pretextual traffic stop. In that respect, the arresting officer stopped his vehicle for a cracked windshield.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court cited numerous statutes which provided that operating a vehicle with faulty equipment was a traffic infraction. Further, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.021(2) provided, in part, that whenever any person was stopped for a traffic infraction, the officer could detain that person for a reasonable period of time necessary to identify the person, check for outstanding warrants, and check the status of the person's license. The appellate court found that the findings of fact and underlying testimony established that the officer saw a cracked windshield, believed that it posed a safety hazard and, thus, had an objective basis for stopping defendant to investigate. Once he learned that defendant was driving with a suspended license, he had probable cause for a custodial arrest and grounds to search incident to a valid arrest. Further, the officer testified that over the years he had stopped dozens of cars with cracked windshields, and would normally give either a warning or a citation. Thus, under those circumstances, the appellate court held the stop was not an unlawful pretextual stop with the intention of circumventing the warrant requirement.</SPAN></P>

They claimed that their payment of assessments guaranteed them the right to a sewer hookup when they developed their properties in the future. The appellate court determined that assuming that a contractual right to a sewer connection was the special benefit the residents obtained when they paid their assessments for the original Utility Local Improvement District (ULID), there was no basis for their claim that the city promised them priority in the event of a shortage. The city's ordinances did not require the residents to perform any additional act as a new condition to receiving sewer service. They were not being denied a right to a connection until they satisfied a new condition. The ordinance creating the original ULID did not promise to reserve capacity for the ULID properties. The ordinance did not anticipate shortages and did not provide a method for dealing with them. The residents did not demonstrate that the special benefit conferred by their payment of assessments included an ongoing right to priority over the non-ULID property owners who received the 850 units.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Kitsap County (Washington) that convicted him of multiple crimes involving first-degree rape, kidnapping, and unlawful possession of a firearm stemming from an attack on his wife, and that imposed an exceptional sentence based on defendant's extensive criminal history and the existence of his current convictions as authorized by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.712.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the exceptional sentences violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial because they were imposed based on facts not submitted to the jury and must be vacated under the Apprendi/Blakely rule. The court noted that the trial court identified three aggravating factors: deliberate cruelty; domestic violence; and that the standard range sentence was clearly too lenient under the multiple offense policy. The court held that the question of whether defendant manifested deliberate cruelty and engaged in domestic violence were questions of fact, which required a jury determination, and thus were not valid under the Blakely rule. However the court found that the trial court's imposition of an exceptional sentence was justified under the &quot;free crimes&quot; doctrine because, without the additional time, defendant's second-degree rape conviction would have gone unpunished, which was an unjust result and clearly too lenient as provided in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.535.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed after he was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver arguing that the prosecutor committed misconduct in closing argument. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction, stating that the prosecutor's remarks that defendant had been employed as a brush picker for only $400 a week were not flagrant or ill-intentioned. Defendant argued that the reference was made for the jury to determine that he was guilty by inferring that someone in his financial state would only purchase a lot of cocaine if he was acting as an agent for an unnamed financier and that his intent was to improve his financial condition. The court stated that the trial court instructed the jury that the prosecutor's argument was not evidence and that they were to rely only on the evidence produced at trial during their deliberations. Considering the other evidence suggesting that defendant was acting with or for others in the transaction and that he intended to deliver the cocaine either to the others participating in the deal or the public, the court could not say that the misstatement and the prosecutor's brief focus on defendant's economic status influenced the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to first degree theft in the Superior Court of Clark County, Washington. His crime regarded the embezzlement of money form his stepmother, for whom he had been appointed guardian of her person and estate. The trial court imposed an exceptional sentence, based on two aggravating factors. Defendant appealed as to his sentence because said aggravating factors were not submitted to a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The uncontroverted evidence established that defendant took more than $ 200,000 from his stepmother's estate. That was 133 times greater than the minimum threshold for first degree theft. Thus, the trial court made the very common sense determination that an exceptional sentence was supported by the fact that defendant's crime was facilitated by a breach of fiduciary duty and was a &quot;major economic offense.&quot; However, those facts did not suffice for the appellate court. It concluded that per the United States Supreme Court's holding in Blakely v. Washington, such findings could not support an exceptional sentence because they were not made by a jury or admitted by defendant. The appellate court also concluded that Blakely errors were not subject to a harmless error analysis. Thus, even though defendant did admit to loaning himself money from his stepmother while he was her guardian and using it for his own personal gain, because he did not actually admit to the precise amount, and because he did not technically admit that his action constituted a breach of fiduciary duty, the appellate court held he was entitled to resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the matter was remanded for resentencing within the standard range.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sentence on remand, arguing that (1) the court on remand was prohibited from considering a prior Oregon sex offense when determining his offender score; (2) the court on remand failed to properly classify the prior Oregon offense; and (3) his exceptional sentence was improper under Blakely. The court held that on remand, the trial court properly considered his prior Oregon sex offense. The trial court also rightfully relied on the initial classification of that offense and offender score calculation because the issues were not addressed in his prior appeal. But the court vacated the exceptional sentence and remanded for resentencing in accordance with Blakely. A complete reading of the court's opinion showed that it did not hold that the Oregon offense was no longer part of defendant's offender score. The trial court made the findings supporting the enhancement and defendant did not admit the facts supporting the exceptional sentence. Thus, the case clearly fell under Blakely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant appeal challenged defendant city's approach to regulating commercial solid waste collection which required a city contract. Plaintiffs, two companies, sued defendant, and also defendant waste management company, alleging constitutional and statutory violations. The Superior Court of King County, Washington, granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. The companies sought review, alleging constitutional violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies argued that the city's ordinances violated the privileges and immunities clause of the Washington Constitution because they made it illegal for anyone other than the waste management company it contracted to be in the business of hauling construction, demolition and land clearing waste (CDL). However, the appellate court noted that Washington courts had repeatedly held that the regulation of solid waste was a valid exercise of local police power. The city had articulated important public health objectives to maintain the environmental standards established in its long-haul disposal contract with the waste management company. Thus, there was no constitutional violation. Secondly, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 81.77.020 did not state, as the companies argued, that once a city contracted with one vender, other venders who wished to collect solid waste no longer needed a state certificate. Because the companies (a construction company and a waste hauling company), did not have a certificate, they did not have a valid contract between themselves for hauling such waste. Finally, the companies did not show that they were wrongfully excluded from bidding on a city contract per state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charge was filed more than three years after the alleged domestic violence occurred. Defendant, who was a police officer, argued that the statute of limitations had run. The State responded that under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.080(1)(b)(i), a ten-year statute of limitations applied when a public officer committed a felony in breach of duty or in violation of the oath of office. The trial court, in denying defendant's motion to dismiss, ruled that the statute of limitations was ten years because the alleged assault would be a violation of defendant's oath of office, which prohibited violation of any law. The court held that the extended statute of limitations for felonies for public officers was applicable to police officers even when they were off duty. Defendant was a public officer, as defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.110(13), when he allegedly assaulted his wife, and he was thus subject to the extended statute of limitations regardless of whether he was acting in his official capacity. The court declined to consider a constitutional challenge to defendant's oath of office on religious freedom grounds, holding that defendant lacked standing to raise this argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury of the Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, convicted defendant, a police officer, of official-misconduct under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.80.010, based on the allegation that he took money from a citizen during a traffic stop without legal justification. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the terms &quot;unauthorized acts&quot; and &quot;duty imposed by law&quot; in &sect; 9A.80.010 failed to give notice and did not prevent arbitrary enforcement. The court disagreed because people of common intelligence could understand the meaning of the statute. The statute also was not vague within the context of the case because people of common intelligence could understand that taking money from a citizen during a traffic stop was conducting an &quot;unauthorized act&quot; and that an officer conducting a search had &quot;duty imposed by law&quot; to return any money to the owner of the wallet. The statute did not invite arbitrary enforcement. The court agreed with defendant, however, that the trial court committed reversible error by omitting the element of intention to commit an unauthorized act from the &quot;to convict&quot; instruction. The error was not harmless, even though the jury found that defendant intentionally obtained a benefit under color of law, because there was an argument that defendant found the citizen's money, rather than taking it. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant, in an official capacity, took the money from the wallet and kept it &quot;under color of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>

As a result, several CCOs visited defendant and searched his home and computer; they did not have a warrant. Based on what they found, they contacted the police and arrested defendant. Relying on information obtained from the CCOs, police officers obtained a warrant to search defendant's home, computer, and media storage devices. As a result, defendant was convicted of numerous sexual crimes. On appeal, the court reversed, stating that the trial court lacked authority to extend his community placement under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.120(10)(c) (1998). When his term expired in April 1999, he was no longer a probationer with a lessened expectation of privacy. The 1999 order was invalid and the initial search made pursuant to the order but without a warrant violated Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed, finding that the 2003 legislative amendment that included assault as a predicate crime for second degree felony murder was not retroactive because retroactive application would violate the ex post facto clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction as an accomplice to first degree robbery and for attempted second degree intentional murder where the jury was entitled to disbelieve defendant's testimony that he was unaware of the knife until he saw his accomplice throw it into the river ten minutes after the robbery, and that he thought the accomplice was merely punching the clerk in the back. The trial court gave the exact accomplice instruction proposed by defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accused father appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Thurston County (Washington) that denied his motion for reconsideration of the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants, Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and three social workers, on their statute of limitations and qualified immunity defenses in the father's action alleging violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and negligent investigation in a child abuse case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father claimed the trial court erred in finding that his claims were barred by the statute of limitations; that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.16.190 was constitutional; and that he was collaterally estopped from relitigating those issues because of his prior federal action against law enforcement officials. The father was convicted of child abuse in 1995, but the State dismissed the charges in 2000. The father claimed the statute of limitations began to run when his conviction was invalidated in 2000. The court noted that under &sect; 4.16.190, the statute of limitations began to run when the factual basis for the action became known to the father, and that he admitted that he knew at the time of his sentencing in 1995 that the investigation techniques used could have led the children to allege abuse that never occurred. The court also noted that &sect; 4.16.190 only tolled the statute of limitations during his incarceration before sentencing and that the federal court had already decided the constitutionality issue. The court held that the father's claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 failed because the DSHS workers did not make the decision to arrest and prosecute him and they had qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developers sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington), which found in favor of respondent city and dismissed the developers' lawsuit challenging the city's imposition of a storm water general facilities charge (GFC) and an obligation to upgrade a storm water pipe in order to gain approval of commercial development plans for their property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a finding against them, the developers appealed. The court stated that given liberal notice pleading requirements, the developers' complaint had provided the city adequate notice of its challenge to the upgrade obligation's legality. Thus, the trial court erred in refusing to consider the claims. Further, given the substance of the summary judgment motion and hearing, and that all of the developers' claims were based on the same circumstances and very similar facts and evidence, the developers provided the city adequate notice of the constitutional claims. The trial court also abused its discretion in denying the developers' motion to amend the complaint to clarify the challenges to the constitutionality of the city's storm water pipe upgrade obligation. The trial court failed to evaluate whether the developers' amendments prejudiced the city. There was no evidence of prejudice to the city from the amendments when proposed by the developers and the amendment was not so untimely as to dictate denial on that basis alone. The law of the case doctrine precluded review of the developers' challenge to the GFC's legality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded for trial only on the developers' challenge to the upgrade obligation's legality and to allow the developers to amend the complaint to clarify the constitutional claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.024. Defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress all evidence obtained following his detention by a police officer; namely, his admission. The Superior Court of Snohomish County, Washington, convicted defendant, sentenced him to 75 days confinement, and required him to submit a biological sample for DNA testing. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to justify the warrantless seizure. The evidence established that another officer attempted to stop a vehicle because it had no rear license plate, but the vehicle drove off at a high rate of speed instead of stopping. The vehicle contained four individuals and was speeding north. The court found that these facts established reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The officer was also informed that a vehicle was sighted. The officer made contact with the four individuals, who admitted they were associated with the vehicle. The officer had reasonable suspicion that defendant and his companions were involved in criminal activity. It was not error to deny defendant's motion to suppress. The late entry of Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.6 findings did not require reversal because the belated findings and conclusions were consistent with the oral ruling and there was no showing that defendant suffered any other prejudice. Finally, the argument that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.43.754 authorized a warrantless search without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the Washington Constitution, was rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1991, defendant was convicted of first degree murder. Defendant was sentenced to 250 months of incarceration. Three months later, defendant's sentence was modified to add two years of community placement. The judgment and sentence were affirmed. Over eight years later, defendant filed pro se a Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8(b) motion for relief from judgment. The Superior Court Benton County, Washington, denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over eight years passed between when the mandate was filed in defendant's first appeal and when he filed the Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8(b) motion. Consequently, the instant court found that his motion was untimely unless it qualified as an exception under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100. Defendant's motion was not &quot;based solely&quot; on the grounds specified in &sect; 10.73.100. A &quot;mixed&quot; motion was subject to the one-year limit of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090. Consequently, the motion was properly dismissed. Defendant knew of the mandatory two-year community placement in his modified judgment and sentence before he argued his first appeal, decided in 1994. That first appeal also settled the issue of insufficiency of the evidence. The remaining issues raised in the motion involved a purported amended information charging defendant with second degree murder. However, the amended information was never filed and defendant was never charged with second degree murder. Equitable tolling of the time limit was not justified because defendant did not show material mistakes, prejudice, or that he did not know all the necessary facts within one year after his amended judgment became final.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Grays Harbor County (Washington), which convicted him of attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle, second-degree assault with a deadly weapon in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.021(1)(c), and two counts of first-degree malicious mischief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions, which stemmed from his fleeing from pursuing police vehicles. On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that under the apprehension of harm definition of assault, his intent to inflict the apprehended harm was clearly irrelevant. In defendant's statement to he police, he admitted that he intentionally struck one of the victim's car in an attempt to push through the stopped vehicles and elude the pursuing officers. The trial court could have reasonably concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's act of driving into the stopped vehicles was intended, at least in part, to scare the drivers of those vehicles into moving in order to avoid being harmed. Further, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.36.021(1)(c) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied in his case because the court could not otherwise conclude that the statute failed to provide adequate notice and standards to prevent arbitrary enforcement. However, prior convictions could not alone support an exceptional sentence. Because they were the only basis for defendant's exceptional consecutive sentence, resentencing was required.</SPAN></P>

Mun. Code &sect; 11.19.143(D), which provided an amortization period of one year for nonconforming adult stores to relocate or change the nature of their businesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The video company operated adult stores in buildings leased from the property manager. The issues were whether regulating the location of adult stores violated constitutional rights and whether the administrative hearings followed proper procedures. The court affirmed and held that Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 did not justify extending greater state constitutional protection to adult stores. Nothing in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.080 prevented the city from raising a collateral estoppel defense regarding the ordinances' constitutionality in its response brief to the land use petition. The state constitutional issue was resolved in the video company's federal action; thus, the manager was estopped from raising that issue. The manager was also collaterally estopped from arguing additional prior restraint, and the ordinance did not qualify as a bill of attainder. As the parties entered into the leases subject to further regulation by ordinance, former Spokane, Wash. Mun. Code &sect; 11.19.143(D) did not unconstitutionally impair the leases. The record supported the hearing examiner's conclusion that extension of the amortization period was not necessary beyond what was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1996, defendant requested and received a deferred prosecution for DUI. In 1999, after finding that defendant had successfully completed the deferred prosecution conditions, the DUI charge was dismissed, entering a no conviction on his record. In 2002, defendant was charged with another DUI, and defendant pled guilty as charged. The trial court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence for a DUI offender with one &quot;prior offense,&quot; based on defendant's previous deferred DUI prosecution. The appellate court ruled that defendant failed to show lack of notice or any due process violation when the trial court used his prior deferred DUI prosecution to enhance his sentence under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.5055(11)(a)(vii) (2002). Former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.5055(11)(a)(vii) did not violate due process by increasing the penalty for a second DUI where defendant had previously admitted to having committed a prior DUI under a deferred prosecution. Defendant knew that if he drove again while under the influence, his penalty for the new DUI would be more severe than it would have been had the new DUI been his first offense.</SPAN></P>

After he was convicted, defendant sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the State was unable to show the age of the persons involved. However, the not guilty verdict on some of the charges did not bar his conviction for the attempted possession of constitutionally unprotected materials under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.28.010(1). The court noted that impossibility was not a defense to attempt; therefore, it was irrelevant that the pictures possessed by defendant did not depict actual minors. Next, the court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.070 was not constitutionally overbroad. The crime was not expanded to images that appeared to depict minors because minor was defined under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.011(4) as someone under the age of 18. Further, the State was required to make a showing that defendant was aware of the nature and content of the materials possessed. Finally, the court determined that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction because the record showed that defendant intended to obtain the materials and took a substantial step towards obtaining them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by not granting his motion to extend juvenile jurisdiction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.300, in anticipation that he might be acquitted of the first degree assault charge. The appellate court noted that defendant's arguments concerning &sect; 13.40.300 were based on his assumption that jurisdiction was defeated under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.04.030 when the jury acquitted him of first degree assault.  The statutory criteria for original jurisdiction under &sect; 13.04.030(1)(e)(v) were met. The State did not amend the charges against defendant. He was found not guilty of assault in the first degree. Use of the word &quot;alleged&quot; indicated that the legislature intended the charge, not the final outcome, to dictate the proper jurisdiction. The silence regarding alternative procedures upon acquittal of all automatic-transfer charges also indicated that the outcome of the prosecution had no affect on jurisdiction. Jurisdiction attached when certain enumerated offenses were charged. Because defendant was properly tried in adult court under &sect; 13.04.030(1)(e)(v), he was not entitled to a declination hearing under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 13.40.110.</SPAN></P>

Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 43.88.110(6), because the option to purchase set a price in excess of $ 9,000,000, the Office of Financial Management was obligated to review and approve the purchase. Because the GA never obtained the necessary approvals, which were set out in the option agreement, the documents did not bind the State.

Defendant was originally charged with first degree robbery and first degree rape, but the State was permitted to amend the information to the charges for which defendant was convicted.

The court held that the amendment of the indictment was proper; no prejudice to defendant was shown. The prosecutor also properly referred to the sexual assault. The robbery counts encompassed the sexual assault. The elicitation of defendant's testimony that he stopped speaking to police and asked for an attorney was not a violation of defendant's rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father fell at least six months behind in his child support payments, owing $ 16,255. The prosecutor filed a petition for modification of child support on the father's behalf, requesting a reduction in his monthly obligation. The request was rejected and the father's obligation was increased. Soon after, a license suspension action was initiated. The father argued that revocation of his driver's license was a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment substantive right to a livelihood. The appellate court ruled that the father failed to prove that any of his rights were violated. The sanction and the underlying conduct need not be directly related, but instead must only be rationally related. The State had satisfied this burden by providing evidence that license suspension, or the threat of license suspension, had proven an effective support enforcement tool. Because the threat of license suspension was an effective tool, it was rationally related to the problem of delinquent obligors. Also, since the father did not claim a personal infringement of his privacy, he did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 74.20A.360 and 26.23.120.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, King County (Washington) convicted defendant of two counts of second degree rape and imposed indeterminate sentences under the nonpersistent offender statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.712. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the indeterminate sentences imposed under the nonpersistent offender statute violated the Sixth Amendment. The presumptive range for a minimum term was between 102 and 136 months pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.20.021(1)(a). Defendant argued the sentence imposed was not an indeterminate sentence but a determinate sentence under the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) that was invalid under Blakely. Sentences under the nonpersistent offender statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.712, were not determinate sentences, and the focus of Blakely was on the maximum sentence a judge could impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. The jury verdict for the crime of second degree rape mandated a maximum term of life as part of the indeterminate sentence. Thus, Blakely was not implicated to the extent of the maximum term of the sentences the court imposed. The maximum term of the sentences was life. The minimum term imposed was 204 months. The verdicts authorized the maximum term, and the minimum term did not exceed that maximum. There is no violation of the Sixth Amendment under Blakely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court unconstitutionally interfered with his right to parent his children. The court disagreed, explaining that until the time of trial, the grandmother, at the father's request, had custody of and parented the children for four years, over half of each child's life. Thus, she had essentially become a de facto or psychological parent. The court rejected the assertion that, as a matter of law, a nonparent could not bring a third party visitation action. United States Supreme Court precedent, although limiting court interference with parental decisions, did not preclude court-ordered visitation where the nonparent seeking visitation brought a petition during the pendency of marriage dissolution proceedings between the children's parents, the nonparent had had legal custody of the children for a significant portion of their lives, and the parent objecting to visitation had failed to show a likelihood that such visitation would be detrimental to the children. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.240 did not have the problems that had been discussed by the United States Supreme Court with regard to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.10.160.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff American Indian appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington), which dismissed his declaratory action claiming that he should be exempt from all Washington excise taxes and regulation contending that he was an Indian doing business on Indian trust land, entitled to exemptions under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 82.24.260, 82.24.900, and 82.26.040.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sold tobacco products at a smokeshop on a tribe reservation where he was not a tribal member. The trial court granted the State's Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the majority of plaintiff's claims. The court held that the relevant law provided the tax exemption only for Indians who were members of the tribe on whose land they were operating. Wash. Admin. Code 458-20-192(5) included only those persons who were enrolled with the tribe upon whose territory the activity took place and did not include members of other tribes. The court also noted that the definition of &quot;Indian&quot; in 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1301 pertained solely to criminal jurisdiction. Also, the existence of a consensual business relationship with the tribe did not give plaintiff the same benefits as a member of the tribe. As to plaintiff's claim that a compact existed, the claim involved no justiciable controversy because he is concerned only with a hypothetical compact between the State and the tribe. He did not show that such a compact currently existed or is under consideration such that it would adversely affect him. Therefore, plaintiff failed to present a justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>

The county permitted the individual to operate a road across the property for logging purposes only. The individual then proposed a subdivision of the property. The county rejected the proposal contending that it was incomplete for noncompliance with the Critical Areas Ordinance (CAO) and other environmental regulations. The individual sought judicial review of the decision contending that the county misinterpreted the CAO, substantial evidence did not support the decision, the decision was clearly erroneous, and the CAO was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court affirmed the county's decision, and the individual appealed. The court noted that the county was vested with discretion to interpret the provisions of the CAO, and the interpretation it gave the particular provisions was supported by substantial evidence, was not clearly erroneous, and thus was proper. Furthermore, the CAO was not vague or unambiguous and did not tread upon an individual's constitutional rights. Therefore, since the individual failed to show entitlement to relief under Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant placed sexually explicit notes on a fence at a day care where it was likely that children would see them and at various places where it was likely that young women would find the notes. The court affirmed and held that the fact that defendant placed notes on his neighbor's lawn that described the neighbor's daughter, even though the daughter did not read the notes, was sufficient to fulfill the communication element of CMIP. As to the day care notes, the court stated that it would be absurd to require that a minor understand the prurient nature of the communication. Further, the attempted CMIP was supported by defendant's act of placing a pair of underwear in the day care parking lot because it was a substantial step toward the commission of the crime. The court also upheld the harassment conviction because it was not required that the speaker actually intended to carry out the threat. Finally, the court held that notwithstanding an expert's conclusion that defendant authored the notes, the court had probable cause to issue an affidavit to obtain samples of defendant's handwriting from his residence.</SPAN></P>

Concluding that &quot;judgment&quot; under Rule 4.2(f) meant the date the judgment and sentence were filed with the clerk, the court held that the trial court erred by not considering the merits of defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Because the determination of whether defendant's plea of guilty was voluntary and intelligent was a question of fact peculiarly within the province of the trial court, the court remanded the issue and defendant was entitled to representation by counsel on the motion because it was an essential stage of his prosecution.

Respondent, Washington Department of Labor and Industries, entered a final order requiring the claimant to reimburse it for workers' compensation payments the claimant had received.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant injured himself while working. The claimant applied for and received workers compensation, and also filed a third party lawsuit. The claimant informed the Department that he had recovered $ 37,000 in settlement, and upon being informed of the settlement, the Department closed the claim and issued the final order. The claimant sought to invalidate the portion of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 51.24.060 that required the offset. The claimant argued that the Department should not be permitted to reimburse itself from any funds recovered in the tort action for noneconomic injuries such as pain and suffering for which industrial insurance did not compensate. The appellate court ruled that the claimant had not shown how the constitutional principles he asserted related to the workers' compensation statute. The claimant provided no authority to support his claim of a fundamental right to a tort remedy, did not adequately rebut the Department's authority to the contrary, and he provided only a theoretical discussion of each constitutional protection he argued the statute violated, without tethering his theory to case law or the facts of his case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Washington voters approved initiative 655, codified at Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 77.15.245, which made it unlawful to hunt black bear with the aid of bait or to hunt black bear, cougar, bobcat, or lynx with the aid of dogs. Washington voters approved initiative 713, codified at Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 77.15.192, .194, .196, and .198, which prohibited the use of body-gripping traps and other devices to capture animals and banned the use of two poisons, sodium fluoroacetate and sodium cyanide. At issue was the jus publicum, or public authority interest. The initiatives' bans were also subject to important exceptions. The initiatives did not interfere with a State grant of authority to a local government. In passing the initiatives, Washington voters did not give up control over the State's natural resources in violation of the public trust doctrine. Rather, the initiatives as implemented provided specific restrictions on techniques for hunting and trapping certain wild animals. If anything, this was an assumption of greater rather than lesser control. The nonprofits' challenge failed, because the State did not relinquish control over the public's interest in the State's natural resources.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Clark County (Washington) convicted defendant of first degree burglary and first degree assault under an accomplice liability theory. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.08.020(3), to show accomplice liability, the State had to prove defendant knew about the crimes the principal committed. There was no abuse of discretion in allowing a qualified expert to explain the slang term &quot;tax.&quot; No evidence supported a finding that defendant acted as a principal. The only way the jury could find him guilty was if they found accomplice liability. The jury instructions properly stated the law and required the jury to find defendant, whether as accomplice or principal, committed each element of the crimes. The jury instructions correctly informed the jury that when one accomplice was deemed armed, other accomplices could be considered armed. It was harmless error to include the word &quot;possession&quot; in the special verdict form, as the verdict would have been the same. The prosecutor's comments in closing argument did not warrant reversal. As the record supported the State's reference in closing argument to defendant's knowledge that the principal was armed, counsel's failure to object during closing argument did not fall below an objective standard of performance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of methamphetamine and use of drug paraphernalia in the Superior Court of Lewis County, Washington. Defendant appealed, asserted the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress the evidence seized without a warrant. She argued that the officer's reason for the initial traffic stop, obstructing the roadway, was invalid. She also asserted that the statute authorizing a strip search was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record established that the officer observed defendant's car in a cul-de-sac. The officer testified that he found the dome light suspicious. The officer asserted he was not sure whether a large vehicle would have been able to pass the car. The evidence was contradictory as to whether the car was one foot or two feet away from the curb. Even though neither the officer or the trial court could determine what if any law was being violated, the trial court concluded that some law must have been violated. The appellate court concluded that defendant must have violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.575, which required a car to be parked within 12 inches of the curb. The appellate court also concluded that the officer had an objective, reasonable suspicion that the car was improperly parked on a public street. Consequently, where defendant's passenger was arrested on an outstanding warrant, and a search of the car was done incident to his arrest, the methamphetamine found was admissible. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.79.130, allowing for a strip search, was unconstitutional, where there was reasonable suspicion that defendant had contraband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence, and her conviction, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether a county ordinance banning social card rooms constituted either a taking or a denial of due process, whether the County was estopped from enforcing the ordinance, and whether it either violated equal protection or was in conflict with and thus preempted by state statute. The threshold questions were whether it destroyed or derogated any fundamental attribute of property ownership. If the property owner claimed less than a total taking and if a fundamental attribute of ownership was not otherwise implicated, then the second threshold question was whether the challenged regulation safeguarded the public interest in health, safety, the environment, or the fiscal integrity of an area. Because the answer to both threshold questions was no, there was no taking. There was no destruction or derogation of any fundamental attribute of ownership - no total taking or denial of due process, the County was not estopped from enforcing the ordinance, and the ordinance did not violate equal protection and was not in conflict with and thus preempted by state statute.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 79.96.080 declared invalid under the public trust doctrine and equal protection principles, and generally challenged the department of natural resources' right to manage resources on aquatic lands. The Superior Court of Thurston County, Washington, granted summary judgment in favor of the department. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the association argued that the department had no authority to regulate geoduck harvesting and that its regulations for auctioning geoduck harvesting rights: (1) violated the public trust doctrine; (2) violated equal protection safeguards; and (3) were inconsistent with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 77.04.012. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the department could manage and sell geoducks on public lands, which included state-owned aquatic lands, under Wash. Rev. Code chs. 79.02, 79.90. Further, the department had a continuing obligation under the public trust doctrine to manage the use of the resources on the land for the public interest, and shellfish embedded on public property were resources that invoked a public right under the public trust doctrine. The department's procedures and regulation of commercial geoduck harvesting served the public, satisfied the public trust doctrine's requirements, and was not an unconstitutional infringement on the public's rights. The challenged statute applied only to geoduck harvesting, did not create classes of harvesters, and, thus, did not trigger equal protection principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company had pipes underneath the owner's land. When the owners sought to revoke their permission to use the property, the company filed a condemnation action. The trial court condemned a portion of the property and dismissed an inverse condemnation and trespass claim. The owners then sought review. In affirming, the court determined that it was entitled to review whether or not the company's statutory authority was constitutional. However, the challenge under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 8.20.160 was meritless since damages were favored over an injunction after a taking under Washington law. Further, the dismissal of the inverse condemnation claim was proper because the damages were the same as those in condemnation cases. However, the owners were not precluded from bringing their claims for an additional trespass in a separate tort action. The owners were entitled to interest under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 19.52.010(1) from the date that the company's possession became non-permissive until compensation was paid into the trial court. But, the owners failed to satisfy the necessary criteria for attorney fees under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 8.25.070(1) on appeal or at trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted of second-degree child rape and unlawful delivery of a controlled substance.

He argued that his attorney was ineffective for failing to interview a potential witness and that he could bring the motion, more than a year after his judgment was final, because he did so within a reasonable time.

The permit allowed the tribe to access its property and an amphitheater from a state route. The organization's challenge to the agency action was based on allegations of inadequate traffic impact analysis contained in an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) jointly prepared by the department and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Because a federal court found the EIS to be adequate under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 4321 et seq., the organization was estopped from relitigating the issue in state court. Thus, the superior court's decision was affirmed. The issue upon which all of the organization's claims rested, whether the jointly prepared and issued EIS traffic impact analysis was adequate, was a crucial issue or determinative fact that was previously litigated and decided in federal court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had filed a civil lawsuit concerning the value of coins that he owned. Opposing counsel filed interrogatories for which defendant provided answers. When opposing counsel asked for more in-depth answers, defendant stated that he could not provide them. Counsel then filed a motion to compel and defendant filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. Soon after, defendant called and left the judge's bailiff six telephone messages. The judge believed that the messages were threatening and hostile and defendant was subsequently convicted of intimidation of a judge. On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that, considering the purpose of the statute and the narrow class of persons to whom it applied, the prohibitions contained in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.72.160, relating to threats defined by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.04.110(25)(e) and (j) were not overbroad. Further, the admissions in defendant's brief and his testimony at trial were both sufficient to satisfy two elements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.72.160(1), that the threats be directed to a judge because of a ruling or decision of the judge in an official proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Grant County Disability Board, determined that cross-appellant firefighter was no longer disabled and could return to work. The firefighter wanted to return to work. However, appellant City claimed the firefighter could not return to work because he was over the age of 50 when his disability ceased. The Grant County Superior Court, Washington, entered summary judgment in favor of the firefighter. The City appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board determined on July 11, 2001, the firefighter's 50th birthday, that he was no longer disabled. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 41.26.130(3) provided that, if at the time that a disability ceased, the member was over the age of 50, he or she would then receive either disability retirement allowance or retirement for service allowance, whichever was greater. The City claimed the firefighter could not return to work because he was over 50 on the date of the Board's decision. Thus, the issue was whether the firefighter could be reinstated given the provisions of &sect; 41.26.130(3). The appellate court held that, as the Board's findings of fact stated its decision was based upon medical opinions from May 2001, indicating the firefighter could return to work without restrictions, the latter date was the relevant date. Thus, at the time his disability ceased, the firefighter was not over the age of 50. Finally, no law prohibited the Board from determining the firefighter's reinstatement was effective July 11, 2001. The City's argument that the Board exceeded its authority by reinstating the firefighter as of July 11, 2001, when it did not enter its order until September 2001, was rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Snohomish County, Washington, convicted defendant of second degree possession of stolen property and one count of attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle. The trial court ruled that the presumptive sentence was too lenient and imposed an exceptional sentence of 29 months on each count, to be served consecutively. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the United States Supreme Court had declared Washington's exceptional sentence provisions facially unconstitutional. The court noted that the only relevant fact was defendant's offender score, which was based exclusively on the jury's finding that he committed the current offenses and on his prior convictions, to which he stipulated and which were expressly excluded from the prohibition against improper judicial fact-finding. Based solely on defendant's undisputed criminal history, the offender scores were extremely high. A standard range concurrent sentence would have meant he received no punishment for one of his crimes. A judge could, consistent with the Sixth Amendment and due process, impose an enhanced sentence based on the fact of a prior conviction. Defendant's exceptional sentence fell squarely within the narrow exception for prior convictions. Prior convictions did not need be proved to a jury. The trial court merely fixed the punishment within the authorized range. Exercising judicial discretion within the range authorized by law was not fact-finding. The exercise of sentencing jurisdiction was not a fact that had to be submitted to a jury.</SPAN></P>

The trial court ordered extensive discovery of financial documentation from all parties, including documentation from other adults residing with the respective parents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved a challenge to an election result by way of a purported declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of Washington's former blanket primary system.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother of an eight-year-old victim notified police after discovering that her son had been sexually molested and raped by defendant and shown pornographic images on the Internet. Police obtained a warrant and seized defendant's computer. Defendant appealed his conviction, claiming there was no probable cause for the warrant as the affidavit contained no corroboration of the victim's statements. The court held that probable cause for the warrant was not based on an informant's tip but on the direct report of the crime victim's mother and the police investigation. Unlike a third party informant, a victim was presumed to be reliable. The court held there was no need for an unanimity jury instruction on the counts alleging a single act of rape because a general verdict reflected unanimous agreement that the one violation occurred, and that the lack of the unanimity instruction on counts involving multiple acts was harmless. The court held that the required evidence under Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county enacted ordinances regarding storm water control. Plaintiff corporations filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief from the ordinances. The corporations moved for summary judgment, claiming the ordinances were for land use control and the county did not follow the statutory procedure for enacting them. The Superior Court for Spokane County, Washington, agreed and granted the motion. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county argued that the corporations' assertion that they did not comply with Washington Growth Management Act (GMA) procedure when it enacted the ordinances brought the issue under the jurisdiction of Washington Growth Management Hearings Board (GMHB). The corporations countered that GMHB did not have jurisdiction because neither ordinance was a developmental regulation. The court held that pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70A.280(1)(a), a developmental regulation had to be adopted under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70A.040 in order for the GMHB to have jurisdiction. Because that requirement was not met, the GMHB did not have jurisdiction. Consequently, the corporations were neither required to bring the action to the GMHB, nor did they have any administrative remedies to exhaust. Finally, the court noted that storm water drainage ordinances were land use control ordinances. Because the ordinances were &quot;official controls,&quot; the county had to follow Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 36.70.570 to 36.70.650 when adopting them. The latter statutes required specific procedures and a public hearing, which the county did not follow. Thus, the trial court properly declared the ordinances invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After convicting defendant of first-degree child molestation on stipulated facts, the superior court sua sponte imposed an exceptional sentence above the standard range based on findings it made at sentencing. Defendant appealed and the court reversed the sentence, stating that the exceptional sentence statutes were not facially invalid, but that defendant's stipulation at trial did not admit the facts the superior court relied on to support the exceptional sentence. On remand, the superior court had authority to empanel a jury to consider aggravating factors. The superior court made no findings following the bench trial that would have supported aggravating factors. The aggravating factors it relied on for the exceptional sentence were based on facts found outside the trial record. Defendant's trial stipulation could not be used to support the aggravating factors for that reason as well. Accordingly, his exceptional sentence violated U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court further stated that double jeopardy principles did not apply to his sentencing and that the invalid procedures were severable from the remainder of the exceptional sentence provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband pointed out apparent inconsistencies between the trial court's oral ruling and its written ruling, where it appeared to have made contradictory statements in its oral ruling indicating that the husband could be present at church or a child's sporting event at the same time as the wife. The appellate court found that the husband's attorney did not seek revision of the written order under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.24.050. The appellate court had to rely on the written ruling and had to assume that the court modified its oral decision before entering its protection order. The trial court had the authority to grant a second protection order, as it had been informed of the earlier temporary order of protection. The husband's rights were properly restricted, when his presence interfered with the wife's right to be free of invasive, oppressive, and harmful behavior. The wife failed to file an affidavit of financial need and, in any event, the order was entered under Wash. Rev. Code ch. 26.50; therefore, the wife's request for attorney fees was denied.</SPAN></P>

Those factors were calculations based on defendant's criminal history and were not findings of disputed fact that required jury resolution.

Appellant property owner's motion to reconsider the permit approvals was denied, and respondent county board of commissioners affirmed. The Superior Court of Skagit County, Washington, dismissed the owner's appeal. The owner sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the property owner raised several issues challenging the dismissal of his claim for failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the Washington Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70C.005 et seq., arguing that the LUPA did not apply to his action. The appellate court found that because the owner's challenge to the LUD formation issue was not a land use decision, it could not be brought as part of a LUPA appeal. Further, the trial court had no authority to review the owner's growth management claims regardless of his compliance with LUPA procedures; thus, any of the owner's that were subject to review by the growth management hearings board would have been dismissed in any event. Because the owner failed to comply with LUPA's procedural requirements, it was impossible for him to succeed on his LUPA appeal, and therefore impossible to succeed in a claim for monetary damages or compensation. Although some of the owner's arguments were excluded from LUPA review, this action was brought as a LUPA petition, and those issues not properly included in a LUPA appeal should have been brought in separate actions or before different tribunals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a marina association, two nonresident tenants, and an association officer, sued appellant city for adopting an ordinance to increase moorage rates. The Superior Court of King County (Washington) decided the ordinance violated the federal Equal Protection Clause, the association did not have standing to sue, and the city had authority to increase moorage rates. The association and the tenants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance increasing moorage rates did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The imposition of the leasehold excise tax (LET) was justified as an effort to compensate municipalities for services to lessees of publicly owned property. As it was paid for by both residents and nonresidents, it did not provide a basis to differentiate between the two regarding the amount paid for city services. It did not undermine the rational basis that justified the city's decision to charge nonresidents higher moorage rates, and the trial court erred in holding the city violated the Equal Protection Clause. Because there was no evidence that any association members were nonresidents, the association did not show it had standing to sue on behalf of its members. Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 35.22.280 and 35.23.440 allowed the city to set rates for the use of its marina. Neither statute limited the city's authority to increase moorage rates for marina tenants. The trial court's dismissal of the two nonresident tenants' Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 claim was not error as they presented no argument regarding whether residents could be treated differently than nonresidents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decisions to dismiss the association for lack of standing, that the city had authority to charge market rates for moorage, and the dismissal of the state constitutional claim were affirmed. The decision that charging nonresidents a higher moorage rate than residents violated the Equal Protection Clause was reversed. The judgment was reversed and entered in favor of the nonresident tenants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married in 1987, and had two children before their marriage was dissolved in 2000. The father did not appeal from the underlying support modification order. The father argued that the trial court erred in imputing income to him because it made no finding that he was voluntarily unemployed. The appellate court found that the trial court did not impute income to the father, but rather based its findings on the father's income on his actual income for the year 2001. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in doing so, nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in denying the father's motion to vacate on this basis. The father also argued that Wash. Rev. Code ch. 26.19 was unconstitutional, because it required parents to pay support in an amount that exceeded the child's basics needs. The appellate court ruled that the father failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the statute was unconstitutional. Furthermore, the mother's request for attorney fees on appeal was denied, because the mother presented no authority for the proposition that a non-attorney appearing pro se could be awarded attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant doctor appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington), which affirmed an order by the presiding officer (PO) of respondent Washington State Department of Health Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery, imposing sanctions against the doctor for engaging in unprofessional conduct. The sanctions required the doctor to receive psychological evaluation and to provide his patients with written estimates.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor argued that the PO's findings of fact did not support the conclusion that his conduct constituted moral turpitude. The court held that there was clear and convincing evidence that the doctor's conduct rose to the level of acts indicating his unfitness to practice the profession and undermined the purposes of the Washington Uniform Discipline Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 18.130, of protecting the public and the standing of osteopathic physicians, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.130.180(1). The doctor had intimidated his patients, harassed colleagues, made unwarranted threats to end treatment of patients who did not comply with his demands, and failed to disclose uninsured treatment expenses. He had failed to comply with the Washington Uniform Health Care Information Act, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 18.130, by failing to send records to patients even though they had paid for them. The doctor's conduct also constituted negligence under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 18.130.180(4). Patients experienced psychological distress as a result of his screaming, yelling, and name-calling. The sanctions imposed directly related to the PO's duty to protect the public and were supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

Appellant stated that the injured driver, whom he knew, got into the car of a friend, who instructed appellant not to tell anyone what he had witnessed. The State charged appellant, who was 17 years old, with obstructing a law enforcement officer. The evidence was sufficient to support the juvenile court's finding of guilt. The act of giving false information to a law enforcement officer could support a conviction under either Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.020 or Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.175.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grandfather motioned to intervene for visitation with his granddaughter, where appellee grandmother had legal custody of the child. The Superior Court of Cowlitz County, Washington, ruled that the grandmother's court-ordered legal custody conferred on her the constitutional rights of a fit parent and denied the grandfather visitation. The grandfather appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandfather argued the trial judge at the hearing lacked the authority to reverse the first judge's order allowing him to intervene. The appellate court noted that the grandfather was a necessary party to the visitation issue in the original custody action pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 19(a). The order restraining the child's parents and grandmother from allowing the child to have contact with the grandfather was improper and the first judge correctly provided the grandfather a remedy by granting his motion to intervene. Accordingly, the hearing judge's post-trial denial of the grandfather's intervention motion was error. The appellate court held that the trial court erred by concluding as a matter of law that a non-parent cannot bring a third party visitation action under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.240. Court-appointed custodians, such as the grandmother, did not have the right to control visitation of their wards. Absent legislative action, non-parents, e.g., legal guardians, grandparents, and persons acting in an in loco parentis capacity, did not have the same constitutional rights as a parent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with crimes related to possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia.

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted the State was relieved of its burden to disprove the statutory defense to bail jumping because the defense of &quot;uncontrollable circumstances,&quot; &quot;negated&quot; the knowledge element. That argument failed, however, because there was no law supporting the contention that the State had to disprove the affirmative defense to bail jumping. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that she presented sufficient evidence to show uncontrollable circumstances. The testimony of her friends, that she was sick, did not meet the statutory definition of &quot;uncontrollable circumstances.&quot; She presented no evidence that she was in the hospital because of illness or any other similar barrier to her attendance. The appellate court held that because the knowledge element of bail jumping did not implicate the statutory affirmative defenses to bail jumping, the defenses did not unconstitutionally shift the burden to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sewer district challenged a decision from the Superior Court of Island County (Washington), which granted respondent owner's motion for summary judgment and determined that the district's utility charges on unimproved lots amounted to a tax rather than a regulatory fee. The owner appealed the portion of the decision that determined that the district would have been able to charge a fee to unimproved lots.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner held title to unimproved lots. The district sent bills to the owner for sewer services. When the owner refused to pay, the district instituted foreclosure proceedings. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the owner's motion, determined that the charge was an unconstitutional tax, but also held that the district was allowed to charge the fee to unimproved lots. Both parties then sought review. In reversing, the court held that the district was permitted to charge rates to vacant lots where service was available, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 57.08.081(1). An actual connection to the sewer was not required. Next, the court applied a three-part test to determine whether the district was taxing the lots or merely charging a regulatory fee. The primary purpose of the district was to collect revenue to finance the public improvement. Further, the money collected was allocated exclusively to the operation of the sewer system. Finally, there was a direct relationship between the rate charged and the service received. Each lot had a right to use the sewer system. Based on the three-part test, the charge was not a tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision that the charge was a tax was reversed. The court remanded the case for entry of judgment in favor of the district. The issue raised by the owner on appeal was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 7.48.010 and 7.48.120, and that the city took the corporation's property in violation of Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 for the benefit of private persons. The trial court dismissed the action and the court affirmed, stating that the trial court did not err in dismissing the claim of nuisance per se because the corporation did not show that the market was a use of property that was not permissible under any circumstances. Further, the street use permits were all that was required to make the market lawful for purposes of nuisance analysis. The takings claim failed because the corporation was not denied access to its property and there was no tortious interference with a business expectancy because there was no evidence that the market affected the corporation's business relationships, either current or prospective, or caused it any other injury or damage.</SPAN></P>

The court stayed defendant's appeal pending the decision of the Washington Supreme Court in another case, which held that the statutory prohibition in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.090 against considering LRAs during commitment hearings and delaying consideration until the first annual review did not violate equal protection principles, as protection of the public and the treatment of SVPs were rational bases for the restriction. The court found that, because at the point of the annual review, the trial court did have authority to order conditions of release, there was no further need for the instruction which informed the jury that the trial court had no authority to order a defendant into an LRA or to undergo treatment in an LRA. That instruction was given in defendant's trial, therefore the court vacated the verdict in the LRA phase of his trial, and held his arguments concerning it were moot. The court rejected defendant's other claims of error and affirmed his commitment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for two counts of first-degree kidnapping, two counts of first-degree robbery, one count of first-degree burglary, and one count of first-degree possession of stolen property. He filed a personal restraint petition, asserting that his due process rights were violated when the jury received erroneous accomplice liability instructions. The Superior Court of Clark County, Washington, denied his petition, and he sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted the instructions used in his trial were found erroneous by a Washington Appellate Court, and that the two Washington Supreme Court cases that appellate court relied on were significant changes in the law, exempting him from the one-year limit for filing personal restraint petitions under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090(1). However, as to one of the subject cases, the subject appellate court had relied on a dissenting opinion. In the second case, the Washington Supreme Court had not announced a significant change in the law with respect to accomplice liability, but had merely stated, &quot;in part,&quot; that knowledge by the accomplice that a principal intended to commit &quot;a crime&quot; did not impose strict liability for any and all offenses that followed. Because the aforementioned cases did not set forth a significant change in the law, defendant's petition for personal restraint was untimely. Finally, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court's accomplice liability instruction did not contribute to the jury's verdict and any error was harmless. The evidence showed defendant was a willing participant in the crimes and did not withdraw.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court, denying defendant's personal restraint petition as untimely, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the superior court erred in denying his motion to strike the restitution order based on the limitation period in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090. He argued that the statute did not apply, as the restitution order was not entered within 60 days, and, therefore, was facially invalid. The appellate court noted that it had rejected a similar argument in a prior case and that the restitution order appeared valid on its face. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090(1) barred collateral attacks brought more than one year after the judgment and sentence became final. Motions like the one brought by defendant under Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8 were subject to the statutory limitations period. There was no showing that the judgment and sentence was invalid on its face. Defendant did not show that any exceptions to the statute of limitations applied. Nothing indicated that defendant was ever affirmatively misinformed regarding his eligibility for good time credit. Defendant did not establish a violation of his constitutional right to appeal under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.585(1). Defendant's other claims were without merit.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court initially noted that a charge underlying an allegation of bail jumping did not have to be valid to support a bail-jumping conviction, so it was immaterial whether the motor vehicle regulation at issue was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The appellate court held that defendant's proposed jury instruction was a misstatement of the law and the trial court properly refused to give the instruction. The appellate court concluded that there was not a substantial likelihood that the error prompting the motion for a mistrial affected the jury's verdict, and because the challenged question did not pertain to the bail-jumping conviction, the issue was moot.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed the trial court violated his due process rights by considering the likelihood that he would re-offend over his entire lifetime rather than in the foreseeable future.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the trial court's decision committing him as an SVP. The court held that it did not need to address the hypothetical constitutional due process question, as appellant's argument that the trial court's decision was based on an improper time frame was contrary to the record. The court held that there was no reversible error regarding the admission of evidence. The court found that the alleged hearsay evidence were statements from appellant's counselors, supervisors, and corrections officers that were not admitted for the truth of the matter, but were admitted to show that appellant needed particular supervision or that he had been warned that certain behaviors were inappropriate. The court also found that the prison warning log testimony was admissible under the business records exception in Wash. R. Evid. 803(a)(6), because the entries were not based on the observation of others, but were based on the observation of the recording officer. The court also held that the actuarial assessment evidence was admissible under Wash. R. Evid. 702, 703, and 403 and that appellant's claims went to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility.</SPAN></P>

The inmate appealed. The State cross-appealed the order denying its motion for a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to former Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had been convicted repeatedly for committing sex offenses.

However, the appellate court found that former &sect; 71.09.094 did not violate defendant's rights to due process or equal protection. Additionally, pursuant to Wash. Rev.

The Superior Court of Grays Harbor County (Washington) granted the owners' summary judgment motion. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city imposed a per lot charge for each lot that could be, but was not, connected to the municipal services. The city contended that the trial court erred in determining as a matter of law that the water and sewer availability charges were constitutionally invalid taxes rather than valid regulatory fees. The city admitted that its purpose in imposing the challenged user fee was to raise revenue because charging rates only to the property owners who chose to connect to the city's water and sewer systems would not generate sufficient revenue. The appellate court found that there was no direct benefit or identified regulatory use of the funds collected from the owners who were required to pay the charges. Instead, the city used the money raised by the charges to operate a free public recreational vehicles (RV) dump for use by all RVs in the area and to reduce the water and sewer charges paid by permanent residents of the developed land. Thus, the appellate court found that the charges were a revenue-generating method that was illegal, and the owners who paid the unauthorized availability charges were entitled to recover with interest the charges paid after April 8, 1996.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denying defendant's motion to suppress, the Superior Court of Snohomish County, Washington, found defendant guilty on one count of possession of a controlled substance (cocaine). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the State failed to prove that the officers had probable cause to stop him and, even assuming that the officers had probable cause to believe a traffic infraction had occurred, the stop was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that the officers stopped defendant's car because the left brake light was not adequately illuminated; as the brake light was barely visible right behind the car, it was logical to infer that the light was not visible from 300 feet away, as required by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.37.200. Thus, the officers had probable cause to make a warrantless arrest. Contrary to defendant's assertion, nothing in the record indicated that the officers were suspicious of defendant and were looking for an excuse to stop him. Therefore, the trial court did not err in ruling that the evidence seized in the search incident to arrest was admissible.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, permitted appellee mother to relocate to Indiana with the parties' child, under the parental relocation statutes, Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the mother was the parent entitled to the presumption in favor of relocation. The appellate court noted that the trial court carefully addressed the Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.520 factors on the record. But the father disputed the court's finding that the mother was the parent entitled to the presumption of relocation under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.430. Sufficient evidence supported the finding that the child resided a majority of the time with the mother. Based on the mother's trial testimony, there was evidence supporting the finding that she was the primary caregiver in California. The father had not met his burden of showing that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.520 violated his substantive due process rights. He cited no authority directly supporting his claim. The State's ability to prevent the relocation of the custodial parent was limited by the right of the relocating parent to care for the child in the manner in which he or she saw fit. The trial court was required to intervene and necessarily choose between the parents' competing interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Yakima County, Washington, granted judgment in favor of appellees, Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) and utilities corporations, by affirming an ordinance adopted by a tribal council imposing a franchise fee from utilities operating within the boundaries of its reservation. The cost of the fees was passed on to all customers within the reservation. Appellant citizens' group appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group argued that the fee was presumptively invalid and discriminatory against nonmembers. They also argued that the WUTC erroneously concluded that the fee should be recovered only from customers within the reservation rather than from the utilities' customers statewide. The appellate court noted that, because the WUTC lacked the authority to determine whether the franchise fee was valid, the additional declarations were not material to either the agency or the superior court proceedings. The group provided no authority suggesting the WUTC had the jurisdiction to determine the validity of any tax. The tribe's franchise ordinance resolved disputes over the utilities' alleged trespasses on tribal land; the utilities thus may have chosen to pay the fee rather than to challenge its validity and still face the tribe's trespassing allegations. The group established that the validity of the franchise fee was questionable; however, it was not possible to conclude that the fee was clearly invalid. The revised tariffs did not violate Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 80.280.090. The portion of the ordinance exacting a tax was a unilateral exaction; the utilities received nothing in return.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, convicting him of unlawful manufacture of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motor home defendant was driving had been reported stolen and was stopped by police. Following standard operating procedure with stolen vehicles, the officer looked inside the motor home and noticed the disabled ignition replaced with a toggle switch to start the vehicle, and a strong odor that he recognized as toluene, a solvent used in manufacturing methamphetamine. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient. The appellate court ruled that the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant had been engaged in the manufacturing of methamphetamine, and there was substantial evidence to support the jury's conclusion that defendant was in possession of pseudoephedrine. An officer found evidence of all three stages of methamphetamine manufacturing, and testified that he could &quot;absolutely&quot; say that methamphetamine had been manufactured using the items in the motor home. Defendant had been the sole driver and the sole occupant of the motor home containing the meth lab. The bottle containing pseudoephedrine and the pill bottles containing pseudoephedrine were located in the motor home and were in defendant's exclusive control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to vehicular homicide in the Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington. The trial court sentenced defendant to 113 months in prison. The trial court imposed a standard 41 month sentence, plus an additional 72 months based on three consecutive 24 month sentence enhancements for each of his three prior offenses of driving while under the influence of intoxicants (DUI). Defendant appealed in regard to his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to modify his sentence. On appeal, defendant specifically attacked only one of his prior DUIs that was used to enhance his sentence. For that prior DUI, he had received a deferred prosecution. In State v. Shaffer, the court of appeals had held that former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.5055(11)(a)(v) (1999) was unconstitutional. Former &sect; 46.61.5055(11)(a)(v) violated due process because it allowed the trial court to impose a sentence enhancement based entirely on an unproven DUI charge. However, defendant's sentence enhancement for a prior DUI deferred prosecution involved former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.5055(11)(a)(vii) (1999). Consequently, Shaffer's holding did not apply to defendant's sentence. Finally, pursuant to precedent, defendant's sentence could be enhanced for a prior DUI deferred prosecution under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 46.61.5055(11)(a)(vii). It was the &quot;granting&quot; of the prior deferred prosecution that triggered its treatment as a prior offense under former &sect; 46.61.5055(11)(a)(vii). Thus, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to modify his sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which convicted him of first-degree kidnapping in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.40.020(1)(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer noticed a vehicle parked without its lights on the side of road. The vehicle's lights then illuminated and it pulled away from the curb. He thought that the driver could potentially be a prowler and stopped the vehicle. The officer noticed that a young woman in the vehicle was crying and she told him that the men in the vehicle had kidnapped her and would have killed her but for the officer's intervention. Defendant was subsequently convicted of first-degree kidnapping and the court affirmed. The officer's suspicion, based on the late hour, the recent presence of car prowlers in the neighborhood, and the odd movement of the vehicle, became sufficiently reasonable and individualized to justify the stop when he discovered the vehicle's connection to a rental agency with a known history of irregular transactions. Also, the fact that the car had been rented in another city suggested that its occupants were not residents of the neighborhood, and intensified the officer's suspicion that he may have interrupted a car prowler or burglar. Thus, the officer was justified in making the investigative stop. Further, Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9A.46.020 was neither vague nor overbroad.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that the Act did not state that proof that the residency information was available from the Internet domain registrant was the exclusive means of proving knowledge under Wash.

The citizen had reason to know that his spam would be directed to Washington residents. The Act, as applied to him, did not violate the Commerce Clause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant pleaded guilty to first- and second-degree child molestation so he could receive a special sex offender sentencing alternative, he obtained new counsel and filed a motion to withdraw his plea. The Superior Court of Pierce County, Washington, denied defendant's motion and imposed a sentence prohibition forbidding contact with the victim and defendant's minor children. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court should have granted his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, because he received ineffective assistance of counsel and his plea was involuntary. Defendant also challenged the sentencing prohibition forbidding contact with all minors as unconstitutional. The appellate court found that defendant's counsel's tactical advice to seek a special sex offender sentencing alternative (SSOSA) was objectively reasonable, because the SSOSA sentence shortened defendant's sentence and imprisonment. Counsel's other decisions demonstrated effective assistance of counsel, as a fourth count against defendant was dropped and counsel successfully requested a competency evaluation for defendant. Counsel's failure to interview the victim was a reasonable strategy decision. The appellate court also found that defendant's plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. However, the appellate court agreed that the sentencing prohibition was error, as there was no evidence that defendant ever molested his biological children or that he violated the pretrial release condition allowing only supervised contact with them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington), which convicted him of unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree, first-degree burglary with a deadly weapon allegation, and first-degree robbery with deadly weapon allegations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on the grounds that the trial court erred in instructing the jury. Defendant claimed that the instructions amounted to unconstitutional comments on the evidence, as the challenged instructions contained &quot;to wit&quot; language that had been condemned by prior case law as constituting a comment on the evidence in violation of Wash. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. The court held that, under the unique circumstances presented by the case, the instructions either did not amount to a comment on the evidence, or the improper instructions were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court noted that, although it found the erroneous jury instructions harmless, the use of &quot;to wit&quot; language in jury instructions often amounted to an improper comment on the evidence and advised counsel to avoid the use of &quot;to wit&quot; language in future &quot;to convict&quot; instructions. The court rejected defendant's ineffective assistance claims, because he had not shown deficient performance or resulting prejudice. The court also rejected defendant's claim that it was improper for a co-defendant's attorney to assert his client's Fifth Amendment rights on her behalf.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant neighbor sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of King County (Washington), which found in favor of respondents, corporation, residents, and administrator, and held that the neighbor was in contempt of court for persistently posting the residents' and administrator's names and addresses on the Internet. The administrator sought attorney fees on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court issued an order restraining the neighbor from harassing his neighbors in a high rise apartment building for senior citizens, and then jailed him for contempt of court when he persistently posted their names and addresses on the Internet. Although the neighbor vigorously put forth the First Amendment as a shield, the trial court focused on his conduct rather than his speech. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, stating that the trial court appropriately used the civil anti-harassment statute,&nbsp;Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.14.010 et seq., to protect the residents from having to endure aggressive and hostile personal confrontations and surveillance while in the privacy of home. The trial court also appropriately concluded that the public posting of personal information violated the no-surveillance provision of the order. Because the anti-harassment orders were not void as a prior restraint, they could not be collaterally attacked and did not furnish a basis for vacating the contempt findings. Since the court affirmed the contempt findings and orders, there was no basis upon which to grant the neighbor's request to reverse the trial court's award of attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed and fees were awarded to the administrator on appeal in connection with the contempt proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the State's petition, a jury determined that appellant prisoner: (1) had been convicted of a crime of sexual violence; (2) suffered from a mental abnormality or personality disorder; and (3) the mental abnormality or personality disorder made him likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence. The Superior Court of Snohomish County, Washington, then ordered the prisoner's commitment. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner argued that the trial court violated his right to due process when it declined to instruct the jury that the State had to prove he lacked volitional control over his behavior pursuant to Kansas v. Crane. However, the Washington Supreme Court had not read Crane as requiring a specific lack of control determination by the jury. Thus, the trial court properly declined to instruct separately on the volitional element. The prisoner was 74 years old. He contended that the actuarial instruments used by the expert in his case lacked proper foundation under Wash. R. Evid. 703, because they were not cross-validated on men 60 years or older. The appellate court noted that the assessment of such actuarial instruments went to the weight the jury would give such instruments and not their admissibility. The expert testified that he used four actuarial instruments to assess the prisoner's risk to re-offend. Even though the expert testified that he did not know whether the actuarial instruments had been cross-validated on men over age 60, the appellate court held their admission was not improper, where those actuarial instruments were generally accepted in the scientific community.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's order for the prisoner's commitment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the POAA violated the state and federal constitutions, because it did not require a jury determination of the fact of defendant's prior convictions. The Court of Appeals of Washington held that, where a prior conviction was used to increase a sentence, the fact of the prior conviction did not need not to be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of a superior court (Washington), which resentenced him to 300 months for each of three counts together with 60-month firearm enhancements, all to run consecutively, on his convictions for five counts of first-degree murder and one count of first-degree assault. His previous sentence was overturned by a federal court on the ground that the sentencing scheme of former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.040 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the resentencing court abused its discretion in declining to revisit the original trial judge's determination that the sentences should run consecutively. He also claimed that the federal court mandate for resentencing did not have any language of limitation and that he was entitled to a full resentencing on every issue. In affirming, the court held that the resentencing court had the discretion not to revisit the consecutive sentence issue, because the issue was never a part of any of defendant's reviews or requests for collateral relief. The resentencing court was not required to consider issues never raised on appeal. The resentencing court applied the most current ranges under the Washington Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 to resentence defendant, and, under the law in effect at the time of his resentencing, the crimes for which he was convicted were not the same criminal conduct. The resentencing court was not required to apply pre-1986 law. The court concluded that the jury instructions and verdicts were sufficient to impose firearm enhancements and that the resentencing court did not err in imposing firearm enhancements and running them consecutively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in imposing an exceptional sentence greater than the standard range. He contended that former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.390(2)(b) was unconstitutionally vague, and the Washington sentencing scheme violated due process. The appellate court noted that the part of the finding regarding the timing of the blood draw and the inference of a higher blood alcohol level (BAC) was erroneous, but the finding that defendant's BAC was one and one-half times the legal limit was supported by the evidence. The record supported the trial court's other findings. Basing the exceptional sentence on the victim's particular vulnerability was proper where the victim could not take evasive action. Defendant ignored her pleas to slow down and drove faster and more recklessly increasing her vulnerability. No constitutional right to sentencing guidelines existed. Defendant's vagueness challenge was not well taken. Finding aggravating factors neither increased the maximum sentence nor defined a separate offense. The trial court did not err in imposing the exceptional sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group submitted an initiative to the city and the city, along with the other respondents, filed an action to enjoin placement of the initiative on the ballot. The city moved for a declaratory judgment stating that the initiative exceeded the initiative power and the trial court granted the city's motion. The group sought direct review with the supreme court, which denied direct review and transferred the case to the court, which affirmed the decision. The trial court's review of the initiative was not premature because there would not have been time after the election for the trial court to review the initiative before it took effect. Under those circumstances, pre-election review, limited to whether the initiative was beyond the initiative power, was appropriate. Further, because citizens could not use the initiative process to enact development regulations under the Growth Management Act (GMA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 36.70A, the issue was whether the initiative was a GMA development regulation, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.70A.030(7). The court concluded that because the initiative placed control on development and land use, the initiative, as a whole, was a development regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in ruling that the prosecutor retained the power to decide whether a defendant should be referred to drug court. Defendant contended that the trial court's ruling that the prosecutor retained the power to decide drug court referrals violated the separation of powers doctrine. The appellate court found that while defendant met the eligibility requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 2.28.170(3)(b), the prosecutor denied referral to drug court on his possession and theft charges because the Department of Corrections had a hold on him and he did not demonstrate that he had a Spokane area residence; both justifiable reasons from the drug court manual. The drug statute did not create a &quot;court&quot; to which all state citizens had a right of access. Drug court referrals had been treated in Spokane County as part of the plea bargaining process. Plea bargaining was contractual in nature. The trial court did not engage in the plea bargain process, and was not bound by the parties' negotiations or agreements. Drug court was not analogous to deferred prosecution. The drug manual was used for guidance and was not officially adopted.</SPAN></P>

Substitute counsel moved for a new trial, arguing a previous juvenile determination of incompetence raised a rebuttable presumption of incompetence that required a hearing before trial. The trial court found defendant competent to stand trial and sentencing and denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and convicted of one count of attempted second degree rape (Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.050(1)(a)) and one count of unlawful imprisonment (Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.40.040). Defendant contended the trial court failed to comply with the competency statute, Wash. Rev. Code ch. 10.77, that there were errors in the court's jury instructions, and that that his trial counsel failed by not seeking an intoxication defense. The appellate court held that all proper competency procedures were followed, and there was no abuse of discretion. As defense counsel raised the issue of incompetence, defendant's argument that he was ineffective for failing to do so failed. Also, the competency commission's report supported the trial judge's determination of defendant's competence to assist counsel at sentencing. The appellate court also held that defendant's proposed instruction on fourth degree assault with sexual motivation was properly excluded. Finally, because the trial court's reasonable doubt instruction was judicially recognized as helpful to the jury and did not reduce the State's burden of proof, the instruction was not constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation and subsidiary were contractors that performed road and highway construction all over the State.

The Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals determined that the Department could not prove that a violation had occurred and the corporation and subsidiary then filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the Department, claiming that &sect; 296-155-305(2) was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Department, stating that the challenge was not yet ripe because the corporation had not been cited for a violation of &sect; 296-155-305 and because the subsidiary had not requested that the reviewing court consider the facts surrounding the issuance of its citation, which had already been vacated. The appellate court affirmed, stating that the corporation lacked standing to challenge the regulation and that the facts surrounding the issuance of the original citation were not contested; thus, no justiciable controversy existed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code ch. 26.26 (2002), or (2) the woman's right to visitation. The mother requested the court to adjudicate her husband as the child's biological father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The woman sought to establish her co-parentage of or at least secure visitation to the mother's child, who was conceived by artificial insemination during the parties' 12-year intimate domestic relationship. The trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed in part. The court agreed that the plain language of the Act did not give the woman a cause of action. While the previous Act might have provided a cause of action for a same sex unmarried individual to pursue parentage based on artificial insemination, the court concluded that the current Act clearly did not. However, the court held that a common law claim of de facto or psychological parentage existed in Washington. The court concluded that the woman had stated an action for recognition as a de facto or psychological parent under the common law, and the court reversed the trial court's decision to the contrary. The court further concluded that the action for visitation under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.10.160(3) was not barred by case law. The court refused to direct that the husband be declared the child's legal father. On remand, a guardian ad litem was to be appointed for the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling that the woman had no cause of action under the Act. However, the court recognized a common law claim of de facto or psychological parentage existed in the state, and the court reversed the ruling to the contrary, as well as the ruling that the visitation claim was barred. The court declined to grant the mother's request to name her husband as the biological father. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the inmate argued that recent Washington Supreme Court precedent mandated remand for consideration of less restrictive alternatives (LRAs). Further, he claimed that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.030 was unconstitutional as it allowed the State to file a SVP petition shortly before his release, and that the State violated his right to substantive due process by delaying the filing of the petition and by denying him treatment during his imprisonment. The inmate also contended that there was a lack of sufficient evidence showing he was a risk to re-offend, and that the trial court erred in admitting certain evidence. In affirming, the court found that LRAs were not considered until the first annual review after commitment. Also, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 71.09.030 did not violate due process and was not unconstitutional because it provided for filing of the SVP petition near the time of release. The inmate failed to show he was prejudiced by the filing of the petition as he was about to be released. Moreover, the evidence was sufficient to show defendant was likely to re-offend. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a psychologist's expert testimony.</SPAN></P>

The State argued that defendant's claim was time barred, because he did not make the motion to modify his sentence at the superior court until two years after the appellate court decided the original appeal. The appellate court noted that DOC's application of former &sect; 9.94A.120(4) did not affect the validity of defendant's judgment and sentence. Therefore, Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant driver sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Thurston County (Washington), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendant corporation, and otherwise found in favor of defendants, State and contractor, in the driver's action for injuries sustained in a vehicle accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver sued defendants for injuries sustained when his car rear-ended the corporation's truck near a construction zone. The trial court found in favor of defendants, but the appellate court reversed, stating that a rational trier of fact could have found that the corporation's driver breached his duty of ordinary care. A jury could rationally have found that a reasonable person in the corporation's driver's shoes would have activated his four-way flashers while slowing, and that the corporation's driver was negligent when he did not do that. Thus, the trial court erred by granting the corporation's motion for summary judgment. To apply the principles of statutory construction was to give Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.44.180(2) (2002) its plain meaning, and to give the statute its plain meaning was to conclude that the driver had the right to challenge a juror for cause. Under &sect; 4.44.180(2), the employee of an adverse party, including the State, could be challenged for cause in a civil case. The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the driver was following the corporation's driver, and the trial court did not err by giving the following-driver instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Snohomish County Superior Court, Washington, affirmed the decision of appellee Washington State Boundary Review Board for Snohomish County (BRB) approving the annexation by appellee city of certain property. Appellant county fire protection district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district challenged the constitutionality of the property owner petition method of annexation and the timeliness of the city's notice to the BRB. The first step of annexation required a petition signed by owners of at least 10 percent of the assessed value of the property. If accepted, the next step was to circulate the annexation petition, which required the signatures of at least 75 percent of the owners. The appellate court found that this did not violate Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. Although the exact filing date of the 75 percent petition was unclear from the record, it was stamped &quot;received&quot; by the city on November 3, 1999, and was submitted to the county assessor on the same date. Even assuming a filing date of October 31, 1999, the notice of intention, which was filed 116 days later, was timely filed under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 36.93.090. Compliance with the 180-day filing deadline was a jurisdictional prerequisite. The district's argument that the petition did not comply with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 35.13.130 had to be raised before the BRB in order to be preserved for appeal because it was within the scope of the BRB's authority and was not jurisdictional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.570.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that evidence of a prior crime was properly admitted under Wash. R. Evid. 404(b), because similarities in the prior crime were relevant to identity a common scheme or plan. The prior robbery took place within an hour and eight miles of the robbery for which defendant was convicted, and another robbery that was charged occurred four days later in the same general geographic area. All were committed with a knife and all of the victims gave similar descriptions. All three robberies were also relevant to a common scheme or plan of robbing small businesses unprotected by security, staffed by one or two female employees, towards the close of business day. The court also held that: (1) time that defendant was in custody was properly excluded from the speedy trial and arraignment calculation; (2) the State's late decision to use evidence of an uncharged robbery did not constitute mismanagement requiring dismissal; (3) a ruling denying defendant's Batson challenge was proper as to jurors who refused to state that they would convict a person based on the testimony of only one eyewitness; and (4) the life sentence was supported under the POAA and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal trespass. He was found incompetent to stand trial and ordered placed for mental competency restoration treatment at the hospital. Because the hospital lacked bed space, he was not transported from the jail to the hospital until 15 days after treatment was ordered. Defense counsel's motion to dismiss for failure to comply with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.77.090(1)(d)(i)(C) was denied. Defendant's petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking immediate release and dismissal of the charges was denied. Fourteen days after he was admitted to the hospital he was returned to jail. He renewed his motion to dismiss the criminal charges for violation of &sect; 10.77.090(1)(d)(i)(C). It was again denied. He was convicted. The issue on appeal was whether the trial court erred in denying his application for a writ of habeas corpus. Because defendant's detention at the hospital did not exceed 14 days, there was no violation of &sect; 10.77.090(1)(d)(i)(C). Time spent in jail waiting for open bed space did not qualify as placement in a secure mental health facility. Defendant's detention was not unconstitutional and he was not entitled to habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of one count of second-degree robbery. The Superior Court of King Count, Washington, sentenced him as a persistent offender based upon a 1994 Washington conviction and a 1992 California conviction. He appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a fast food restaurant, told the clerk that he had a gun, and stole approximately $ 150.

The maximum sentence for second-degree robbery was 10 years, but the trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole under the Persistent Offender Accountability Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.555 et seq. The trial court based the sentence on two of defendant's previous convictions: a 1992 no contest plea to second-degree robbery in California and a 1994 guilty plea to first-degree attempted assault in Pierce County, Washington. The appellate court reviewed his sentencing and upheld the use of defendant's prior Washington conviction as a sentencing consideration. However, because the relevant California and Washington statutes differed, the appellate court remanded to allow the trial court to determine whether defendant's California conduct constituted a &quot;most serious offense&quot; in Washington.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grandmother petitioned for visitation before the Superior Court County of Snohomish, Washington. Respondent father moved to dismiss the petition. The trial court specifically found that the child's parents were not unfit and that under these facts there was no basis to grant visitation to the grandparents. The trial court granted the father's motion to dismiss the petition. The grandmother sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child moved to Germany with her father, where she lived for over two years. She was cared for by her paternal grandparents while her father worked. The father returned to the United States, but the child remained in Germany to live with her grandparents. When the child visited Washington to attend her father's wedding, the father filed a parentage action. Here, the grandmother functioned as the primary caregiver for five years and had a significant relationship with the child. In fact, the trial court order dismissing her custody action found her relationship with the child to be beneficial and significant. Thus, the state had an interest in providing a continuing relationship between a child's primary caregiver and the child. The appellate court held that Troxel did not invalidate Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.240, and that the statute was constitutional. But although the statute applied in this case, it was impossible for the appellate court to determine its specific application to the facts of this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchasers appealed the county's ruling that applied wetland regulations to an &quot;area&quot; of their property and denied them an agricultural exemption.

The superior court then gave the county a reasonable period of time to conduct a wetland determination, stating that it would vacate the cease and desist orders if the county did not act. On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that, based on the intent of Title 18E and the substantial weight given to an agency's interpretation of regulations within its area of expertise, the court could not say that the examiner made an erroneous interpretation of the law. Nor did the purchasers show that the word &quot;area,&quot; as the ordinance used that word and as the hearing examiner applied it, was so vague as to have denied them fair warning that they could lose the agricultural exemption on a portion of their land if they allowed that portion to lie idle for five years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Lincoln County (Washington), which granted custody of the mother's child to his stepmother, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.10.100, after the child's father died. The trial court reinstated the mother's visitation rights under the parenting plan that was set up after the mother and father's divorce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's parents divorced when he was three years old, and the child was placed with his father. The mother was granted liberal visitation rights. When the child was five years old, his mother moved to Oregon, and his father remarried. The father later adopted the stepmother's daughter, and the couple had a child of their own. The day after the father's funeral, when the child was 11 years old, the mother, accompanied by a sheriff's deputy, took the child from the stepmother's home. The court held that, where placing the child with an otherwise fit parent would be detrimental to the child, the parent's right to custody was outweighed by the state's interest in the child's welfare. The trial court's finding that the mother was not &quot;unfit&quot; did not deprive the stepmother of standing to bring the action. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding custody of the child to the stepmother. The trial court's finding of detriment to the child if he was placed with his mother was supported by evidence of actual detriment, including the showing that the stepmother was the child's psychological parent and that the child was integrated into her family.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued the trial court erred in (1) failing to give a unanimity instruction on alternative means of committing first degree assault; (2) allowing testimony about his past drug use; (3) failing to give an inferior degree instruction; (4) admitting prejudicial evidence; and (5) improperly commenting on the evidence. His failure to object to the testimony below regarding his drug use precluded him from raising it for the first time on appeal. The court admitted a letter he had written his girlfriend advising her how to testify at trial. It was relevant to her credibility and her possible motive to recant. The trial court did not impermissibly comment on the evidence. The trial court instructed the jury on alternative means of committing first and second degree assault. It did not, however, instruct the jury that it must be unanimous. The instruction was not necessary because the State presented sufficient evidence supporting each of the alternative means. Because there was no evidence that defendant acted merely negligently or recklessly, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on the inferior degree offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree unlawful possession of a firearm in the Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington. Defendant appealed, asserting that due process precluded prosecution for the offenses, because the sentencing court, in a 1995 underlying predicate conviction, failed to give him statutorily-required notice under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.047(1)(a) (1994), that he was ineligible to possess any firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon his prison release in 1989, defendant was instructed that, under the version of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040 in effect at that time, that he could not possess &quot;pistols or short firearms.&quot; The statute was expanded in 1994 to prohibit persons previously convicted of a serious offense from possessing &quot;any firearm.&quot; Former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040 (1994). A notification requirement was also added pursuant to former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.047(1) (1994). In 1995, defendant pled guilty to second-degree burglary. It was undisputed that the sentencing court at that time did not comply with the notification requirement of former &sect; 9.41.047(1). Then, in 2001, the State charged defendant with the instant crimes. On appeal, defendant asserted he was unaware of the 1994 change in the law and that he reasonably believed he could own or possess &quot;rifles.&quot; However, the appellate court held defendant was on notice of the 1994 change in the law and that due process did not require any court to tell him that he had lost all firearm privileges. Defendant's reliance on State v. Leavitt was misplaced, because, in that case, a defendant was affirmatively misled about the firearm prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1998, the taxpayers applied for sales and use tax deferrals and business and occupation (B&amp;O) tax credits for projects from 1994 through 1997.

The taxpayers sought judicial review and the superior court reversed the decision. The department appealed and one of the taxpayer's cross-appealed the denial of its request for credit for B&amp;O taxes paid. The court reversed and reinstated the decision of the board. Because the taxpayers did not meet the statutory requirements, the department properly denied their requests for a refund for the overpayment of taxes; they were not entitled to the deferrals or credits, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 82.60.03, 82.62.020. Applications for deferrals and credits must have been met before the qualified project began. The court further stated that this was not the rare situation where the futility exception should have been applied and that the department's position that the taxpayers were not entitled to the tax benefits could not have been the basis for the claim of equitable estoppel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 82.02.050(3) of the Growth Management Act, 1990 Wash. Laws ch. 17, the city imposed an impact fee on the permittee to address the traffic impact of the permittee's new building, calculating the fee by averaging the cumulative traffic-related impacts of all new office buildings. The permittee paid the fee under protest and appealed. The court construed &sect; 82.02.050(3) and held that it required impact fees to be reasonably related to the individualized impacts of the particular project. A review of the legislative history of the statute supported the court's interpretation, as did the wording of the statute. The use of &quot;the&quot; before &quot;new development&quot; in the statute indicated a particular new development, not all new development. The court further noted that such a construction assured the constitutionality of the statute, because the exaction of an impact fee had to be reasonably related to the public problem, increased traffic, that was expected to result from the new building. Therefore, &sect; 82.02.050(3) capped the impact fee based on the impact of the permittee's particular project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court and remanded the case for the city to impose an impact fee using any of the methods provided by statute, provided that such fee was not to exceed the individualized impacts of the permittee's specific project.</SPAN></P>

After a jury trial the Superior Court of Clark County (Washington) entered judgment for the buyers on the contract claim and for defendants on the Act claim and dismissed the corporation's counterclaim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before trial one of the principals gave deposition testimony on behalf of the corporation pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 30(b)(6). The principal did not prepare extensively for the deposition and failed to bring the requested documentation. The corporation subsequently failed to produce such documentation as ordered so the trial court bound the corporation to the deposition non-answers at trial on the issues raised by the documentation that was not produced. On appeal the court affirmed the discovery sanction. Based on the court's refusal to dismiss the counterclaims as requested by the buyers, its binding of the corporation to the deposition answers, and its comment that such was the best sanction for the corporation's failure to comply with the discovery requests, the court found that the trial court properly considered lesser sanctions. The trial court's comments that the principal's actions made discovery useless and its frustrations with his failure to comply with discovery orders showed that the trial court found the failure to comply was willful and that the buyers were substantially prejudiced by the failure. Therefore, the sanction was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pled guilty per a plea agreement. The trial court denied defendant's request for a sentence below the standard range, and sentenced defendant to a standard range DOSA sentence of 50.75 months of total confinement, and 50.75 months in community custody. The trial court also provided in its judgment and sentence that the department of corrections (DOC) would have to provide defendant with effective drug treatment, and interpretation and educational services. The appellate court noted that as a general rule, a defendant could not appeal a standard range sentence. Moreover, a DOSA sentence was always within the standard range because it was always based on the midpoint of the standard range. Secondly, defendant failed to demonstrate that the ADA applied in the context of his sentencing. If, in time, defendant believed the DOC violated the special conditions of his sentence, his remedy was to file a civil claim, file for an injunction, or file a personal restraint petition.

The instant court, however, concluded that defendant's actions were sufficient to prove that he obtained property through use of or threatened use of immediate force, violence, or fear of injury. In both instances, defendant approached bank tellers and gave them a note communicating that he intended a robbery. One teller was alone, and defendant leaned over him, prevented him from pressing the alarm, motioned into his jacket, and asked for more money. The teller stated that he was fearful. With respect to the second incident, the note also informed the teller not to engage in any action that would draw attention to her and not to make a scene. The teller testified that she feared he would hurt someone. Further, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of first-degree theft, as the evidence did not affirmatively establish defendant's theory that he did not threaten either teller.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proceeding under the Act, the foundation sent a notice to the attorney general and county prosecutors alleging that the association violated the Act. The attorney general referred the notice to a particular commission for a review and investigation. Later, the foundation sent another letter to the attorney general and county prosecutors stating that it intended to commence a citizen's action lawsuit in ten days if they did not initiate an action against the association. The trial court dismissed the action based on case law interpreting Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The L&amp;I cited the business for failing to ensure its employees' safety on a construction site. The L&amp;I's board of appeals upheld the citation, the superior court affirmed that decision, and the business appealed. The business argued a partial panel of the board could not review the citation, the board improperly declined to apply the unpreventable employee misconduct defense under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.17.120(5), and the offense was improperly designated as a repeat serious violation. The court found that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.17.140 permitted partial panel review. The court also found that the unpreventable misconduct defense was inapplicable, because the business had been cited for prior similar misconduct and had not met the requirements under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.17.120(5)(iv) of effective enforcement of corrective procedures. Also, L&amp;I made a prima facie showing of a repeat serious violation as required under Wash. Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed two financial institutions. He was charged with one count of first-degree robbery while armed with a firearm and one count of second-degree robbery while armed with a firearm. He pled guilty to both counts. His total sentence was 140 months. The judgment and sentence informed defendant that any collateral attack would be subject to Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 10.73.090 and 10.73.100. Defendant filed a pro se motion to vacate his judgment and sentence and withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8 and Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 4.2. He acknowledged in his motion that it was not timely, but argued that it could be considered under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100(5) or (6) because the trial court either exceeded its jurisdiction in sentencing him or there had been a substantial change in the law. He also alleged that his attorney gave him erroneous advice that rendered his plea involuntary. The motion was denied. The State contended for the first time on appeal that the motion was time barred. The appellate court agreed with the State. Defendant's ineffective assistance claim was time barred at the outset by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions by the Superior Court, Spokane County (Washington), for first degree murder, first degree attempted murder, and first degree assault, all with the use of a firearm. Defendant asserted several errors including, inter alia, the trial court's admission of gang affiliation evidence, its excusal of a juror, and its denial of a manslaughter instruction. Finally, he challenged his sentence on double jeopardy grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed a child and injured one of seven other occupants when he fired into a home which housed a man who had recently robbed defendant in regard to a drug deal. The appellate court held gang evidence was admissible to prove ongoing gang rivalry between the victims and defendant and the fact that perceived disrespect was accepted as grounds for retaliatory murder. As a juror stopped showing up, and a doctor advised against his continuing, the circumstances justified his replacement. There was no basis for a manslaughter instruction as the actions could not be found to be reckless. Nothing in the record suggested a prosecutor's remark was flagrant and ill intentioned and the error was easily curable. There was sufficient evidence to support a finding that defendant was present at the scene. That was enough to establish premeditation. The trial court did not abuse its discretion refusing to dismiss the case based on a search of defendant's prison cell as the State's security concerns were acute. Absent a showing that the State would not likely have discovered a witness independently, the trial court correctly rejected the new trial motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death for murder. Upon remand, the Kitsap County Superior Court, Washington, ordered that defendant's sentence run consecutive to a separate conviction for murder in a different county and recommended a minimum term of 600 months. The Washington Sentence Review Board set a 600 month minimum term. The trial court denied defendant's Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 7.8 motion and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being convicted of murder and sentenced to death in the instant case, defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in a different murder case. The federal court of appeals ruled that defendant's life sentence without parole was unconstitutional; thus, in 1991, the trial court recommended a minimum sentence of 600 months, and also ordered that the sentence run consecutive to a sentence for a murder defendant had committed in the other county. In 1993, the sentencing board ordered that defendant's minimum sentence be 600 months. Defendant filed a Rule 7.8 motion in 2001 challenging the 1991 and the 1993 rulings. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the Rule 7.8 motion was untimely as defendant filed it many years after the challenged sentences and the exceptions in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100(3), (5) did not apply. Also, the trial court had power to set the minimum sentence under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.011. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that the sentences be served consecutively as under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.080(3), the sentences were to run consecutively unless specifically ordered to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consecutive sentences and the minimum term of the sentence imposed were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury trial, the Superior Court of Grays Harbor County (Washington) entered judgment on a verdict that convicted defendant of stalking and found him not guilty of unlawful imprisonment. By special verdict, the jury found that defendant had violated a domestic violence protection order, thereby making his offense a class C felony under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46.110(5). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.46-110 for stalking his former girlfriend. On appeal the court rejected defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. Defendant intentionally and repeatedly harassed his former girlfriend by contacting her numerous times after he learned of the restraining order she had obtained against him. The girlfriend stated that she was afraid of defendant, and defendant knew she did not want contact with him based on the restraining order and the girlfriend's statements to him to leave her alone. Such evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The court also found no abuse of discretion in the limited admission of opinion testimony about the cycle of domestic violence. After the State's witness was qualified as an expert on domestic violence and before the witness testified about the meaning of his wagon wheel on domestic violence or on whether the girlfriend was a victim of domestic violence, the trial court sustained defendant's objection because the witness had not been identified as an expert before trial. A limiting instruction to the jury sufficed to prevent any prejudice to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed for the first time that the information to which he pleaded guilty lacked an essential element of the offense. He asserted that the information should have included an element related to his prior felony drug offenses. The existence of prior felony drug offenses led to a doubling of his maximum penalty, altering the standard range and thus changing his time of incarceration from 57 months to 63 months. The court affirmed however, stating that sentencing enhancements imposed by a court based on the fact of prior convictions were not unconstitutional. They did not pose a due process problem under the United States Constitution. Further, the federal constitution did not require that prior convictions be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In the face of that clear precedent, defendant's challenge failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One day prior to the committed person's release from prison for his 1985 rape conviction, the State filed a petition alleging that he was a sexually violent predator.

On review, the court of appeals resolved several issues: (1) &sect; 71.09.070 did not provide a deadline for the State's filing an annual report or conducting show cause hearings; (2) the term &quot;safe&quot; as used in &sect; 71.09.090(2) was not unconstitutionally vague; (3) the committed person's 1994 trial was properly limited to the consideration of LRAs; (4) &sect; 71.09.090 was not invalidated by poor confinement conditions; (5) Wash.

On January 31, 2002, defendant assaulted the victim during an argument. After he was convicted for violating the no-contact order, he challenged the validity of the no-contact order. The court of appeals held that the pretrial order was itself sufficient proof of a valid order. Defendant also testified that he was aware of the no-contact order. The prosecutor's comments during closing argument did not deny defendant his right to a fair trial. The comments concerned the credibility of witnesses and were valid inferences supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer, after noticing an odor of marijuana coming from a building on defendant's property, contacted a judge by telephone to obtain a search warrant for defendant's property. The officer was placed under oath and gave a telephonic statement of grounds for the search. The judge found probable cause and authorized a search, but neither the judge nor the officer executed a written warrant. Marijuana was found growing inside the building. The trial court denied a suppression motion, reasoning that defendant failed to show actual prejudice resulting from the failure to prepare a written warrant as required by Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 2.3(c). The court reversed, holding that a telephonic procedure without the issuance of a written warrant violated defendant's rights under Wash. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Douglas County (Washington) convicted defendant of first degree burglary and fourth degree assault. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim told the deputy she had been assaulted. The victim was hit in the face with a rock by the assailant and blacked out. Witnesses testified that defendant and the victim had prior incidents with each other and that he had accompanied the assailant to the house when the victim was assaulted. On appeal, defendant alleged that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence that he threatened a witness because the evidence was inadmissible character evidence. However, because defendant's attempt to induce the witness to avoid testifying at the trial was analogous to concealing evidence, which was admissible as circumstantial evidence of guilty knowledge, the evidence was relevant and admissible. Additionally, the prejudicial effect of the evidence did not substantially outweigh its probative value. Because the trial court's jury instruction regarding a burglary inference was unconstitutional and the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the remedy was reversal of the burglary conviction. Finally, in the event of a future sentencing hearing, the appellate court instructed that defendant's juvenile offenses should not be counted in his offender score.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's assault conviction, but reversed defendant's conviction for burglary and remanded that cause of action for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother argued that the trial court erred by denying her a hearing and by overruling her objection to the relocation of the child. The court of appeals agreed. Rather than contravening the traditional presumption that a fit parent would act in the best interests of the child, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.520 established a rebuttable presumption that the relocation of the child would be allowed. Thus, &sect; 26.09.520 both incorporated and gave substantial weight to the traditional presumption that a fit parent would act in the best interests of her child. The burden of overcoming that presumption was on the objecting party, who could only prevail by demonstrating that the detrimental effect of the relocation upon the child outweighed the benefit of the change. Section 26.09.520 contained 11 specific factors for the trial court to consider at a hearing to determine whether relocation of the child would be permitted. Because the grandmother met the requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.09.540, the trial court should have held a hearing to determine whether or not the mother was permitted to remove the child over the grandmother's objection.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 9A.76.170 informed defendant of the elements of the crime and the penalty. Thus, while the information arguably did not track the track the penalty portion of the statute, it was sufficient. The court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(1)(b)(iv)&nbsp;unconstitutionally infringed on one's right to bear arms under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 24 by criminalizing firearm ownership for persons merely charged with a serious offense regardless of whether they had relinquished possession.

In the alternative, defendant argued that the telephone harassment statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, his conviction should be reversed and remanded for adequate findings, and his lawyer was ineffective. On review, the court of appeals found that &sect; 9.61.230(2) primarily regulated conduct rather than speech. Section 9.61.230 had a specific criminal intent requirement: the intent to harass, intimidate, torment, or embarrass. The court of appeals held the municipal court did not use the correct legal standard to determine whether defendant had the requisite criminal intent; therefore, substantial evidence did not support his conviction for telephone harassment.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the Grant County Superior Court, Washington, convicted defendant of third-degree child molestation, third-degree child rape, first-degree kidnapping, first-degree rape, and attempted second-degree rape, among others. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised several issues on appeal. The appellate court found that the first-degree rape and the attempted second-degree rape convictions did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy, as defendant's penetration of the victim's vagina with his penis was one unit of prosecution, and his attempt to contact her mouth with his penis was a separate unit of prosecution, independent of the other. Although the acts involved the same victim, were committed at the same place, and occurred only a few minutes apart, they were not continuous and uninterrupted, and defendant's pattern of conduct changed from one act to the next. Thus, the evidence supported the trial court's determination that the two acts did not encompass the same criminal conduct. As the evidence of defendant's prior crimes showed that at least three of the acts occurred in different places, the trial court did not abuse its discretion during sentencing by failing to find that the prior crimes encompassed the same criminal conduct. As defendant opened the door for the State to articulate a doctor's opinion that the victim had been sexually assaulted, defendant waived any objection to the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother brought suit against the employers for damages allegedly caused by knowing failure to use due care, failure to supervise her daughter, and knowingly allowing her daughter to operate dangerous machinery with certainty of injury. The trial court dismissed, finding that the daughter was limited to recovery under workers' compensation and did not meet the requirements for the &quot;deliberate intent&quot; exception of Wash.

The appellate court disagreed, holding that the statute satisfied all three prongs of the rational relationship test. Summary judgment in the employers' favor was proper, as they presented evidence that they had a license to employ children as ice baggers, their machine containing the ice auger exhibited numerous warning signs, and nothing in the record indicated that the machine had injured anyone else.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When plaintiff citizen sought to enforce a trust's language prohibiting the sale of property, the Superior Court of Pierce County (Washington) ruled that the language in the deed that respondent, a non-profit corporation, was to hold the property in question for the perpetual use of certain churches was an unreasonable and discriminatory restraint on alienation and void under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.224. The citizen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-profit owned the property on which its church building sat and wanted to sell the property and build new facilities. The trial court found that the non-profit held the property in a charitable trust in accordance with the deed. The non-profit was the trust's primary beneficiary but not the only one. The deed containing the language at issue was a written instrument, related to real property, and seemed to filter sales by creed.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.224 passed constitutional muster as not being a burden on freedom of religion. The non-profit persuasively concluded that the deed language forbade sale to many different people, even many who fell within the classes protected by Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.224; therefore, the statute applied and mandated that the restrictive deed language be void. The trial court did not err in making its conclusions regarding the application of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 49.60.224 to the charitable trust and that the non-profit could sell the property to any person or entity without regard to the restrictions in the deed. The trial court's findings supported the intent of the trust and the application of cy pres and equitable deviation doctrines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owners challenged a decision from the Superior Court of Clallam County (Washington), which granted respondent county's motion for summary judgment in an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 64.40.020. The owners also challenged the denial of their petition under the Washington Land Use Petition Act (LUPA), Wash. Rev. Code 36.70C.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners sought final plat application for a subdivision. They were required to meet certain conditions before getting final approval. Instead, they chose to submit a bond. However, the bond was never forwarded to the proper authorities. The owners were not given notice of the hearing on their application. After the application was denied, the owners filed a petition to set the decision aside under LUPA. They also filed claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 64.40.020. After the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the county, the owners sought review. On appeal, the court determined that summary judgment was improper. The owners were entitled to actual notice of the hearing. Published notice of the hearing was inadequate because the evidence showed that the county had the owners' address. Therefore, the owners' due process rights had been violated. Further, the plat application had not expired. Former Clallam County, Wash., Code &sect; 29.19.300 (1996) improperly conflicted with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 58.17.140, which gave the owners five years from the date of the preliminary plat approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that summary judgment was improperly granted. The case was remanded with directions to rehear the owners' final plat application. The trial court was also ordered to determine whether the owners were entitled to any relief on their statutory claims.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the claimant's conviction was reversed and the restitution order was vacated. The claimant moved in the trial court for an award of attorney fees. The trial court denied the motion, vacated the restitution order, and ordered the clerk's office to refund the restitution the claimant had already paid. Later, when it learned that the clerk's office no longer had the claimant's money, the trial court modified the order by deleting the refund order. The appellate court ruled that the trial court had no grounds to award the claimant attorney fees and did not err in denying them. The claimant prevailed because of a procedural defect in the State's case, not because a jury found that he acted in self-defense, and the one-day delay in bringing the case to trial did not demonstrate frivolous or malicious action; there simply were no courtrooms available. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in vacating the restitution order and allowing the claimant to seek reimbursement from the county risk management office.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant purchaser sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Clark County (Washington), which confirmed the sale of property in a wrongful death suit brought by respondent judgment creditor against respondent judgment debtor, who sold the property to the purchaser. The purchaser also appealed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the creditor in the purchaser's action to quiet title.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a wrongful death action, the creditor attached the debtor's property by an ex parte process based on an allegation of injuries arising from felonious conduct. After the debtor was acquitted, the purchaser sought to intervene in the wrongful death suit and, after being denied, instituted a quiet title action to remove the attachment. Meanwhile, the creditor received a judgment from the wrongful death suit and forced a sale of the property. The court held that the purchaser had standing because he suffered harm in the violation of his right to due process in the ex parte proceeding and he stood in the shoes of the debtor. Moreover, as a third party, the purchaser could bring an outside action to challenge an attachment because he did not have an opportunity in the tort suit. The ex parte attachment procedure of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 6.25.070(2) violated due process. The property owner had significant interest in keeping clear title; there was a relatively high risk of an erroneous decision based on an unrebutted, low burden; the claimant's prejudgment interest in the property was minimal (without showing exigent circumstances); and the government's interest could not be any greater.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the ex parte attachment and remanded to quiet title to the property, free and clear of the creditor's interest.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained from his car, as the officers' reasonable belief that the car's contents posed a danger to the public, in addition to the vehicle's potential mobility, met the exigent circumstances factors. Further, defendant was not entitled to assert a marital privilege, because defendant and his alleged wife married each other while she was married to another. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of second-degree assault, because the evidence did not establish that defendant committed only second-degree assault.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of unlawful possession of a firearm in the first degree in the Superior Court of King County, Washington. He appealed, arguing, among other things, a violation of his speedy trial rights, that the jury instruction on constructive possession was erroneous, and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two days before a second speedy-trial expiration date, the trial court granted a four-day continuance to allow the state crime lab to test-fire the gun. Defendant cited a case under which foreseeable administrative congestion was an insufficient basis for a continuance. The court found that rule inapplicable, however, because the lab's congestion was caused by an unusual circumstance that required extraordinary resources. There was no problem the State could be induced to remedy, and defendant's speedy trial right was not violated. The court also held that defendant was not entitled to a constructive possession instruction requiring that dominion and control could be immediately exercised. That instruction applied to sentence enhancement, but was not accurate for unlawful possession of a firearm under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(1)(a). The failure to object to a detective's testimony was not ineffective assistance of counsel because the failure to object could have been sound trial strategy. The defense that the police were biased was arguably strengthened by the testimony that the detective would have referred the case to the prosecutor even in the face of exculpatory evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and his friends were involved in an altercation at a mall with another group. A police officer requested the groups to either shop or move along. Appellant began using profane language against the officer. Ultimately the officer escorted appellant to the mall's north entrance and told him he was prohibited from returning to the mall for the rest of the day. The officer informed appellant that he would be arrested if he returned. Shortly thereafter, the officer saw appellant approaching the mall's south entrance. Appellant was arrested, charged, and convicted of criminal trespass. The court affirmed on appeal. The evidence was sufficient to support appellant's conviction. There was sufficient evidence, under Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.08.010(1)(b)(I), 9A.52.010(3), to show that appellant knowingly remained on mall property. The court rejected appellant's public premises defense under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.090(2) and his claim that the mall's policy unlawfully restricted his access to mall property based on his profane speech. Appellant's use of vulgar language lacked constitutional protection, and this served as a proper basis to deny appellant mall access.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was committed as a sexually violent predator. Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington) that he remain in custody at the special commitment center (SCC) based on an adverse jury verdict following an evidentiary hearing on his petition for conditional release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion for judgment as a matter of law. The court of appeals disagreed. The State introduced evidence, through an expert witness, that defendant suffered from a mental abnormality, including five paraphilias: rape, sexual sadism, exhibitionism, voyeurism, and telephone scatalogia. He also had antisocial personality disorder traits. The expert testified that past behavior was the single best predictor of future sexual behavior. Defendant had admitted to at least eight rapes, and several attempted rapes. Despite treatment for alcohol and drug abuse, defendant used marijuana six to 10 times in 1997 and 1998, even though he was confined in the SCC at that time. Another risk factor for defendant was rejection by the community. If defendant was unable to find work, that would be another risk factor. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation owned an adult cabaret club that featured erotic dancing and a variety of private booths. A county sheriff's department conducted numerous undercover investigations at the club. During their investigations, the officers saw dancers engage in various types of sexual conduct in exchange for money, perform at a distance of fewer than four feet from the audience, and make improper physical contact with customers. The city gave the corporation notice of its intent to revoke its business and adult cabaret license and to declare the club a public nuisance. The trial court upheld the revocation of the license on the ground that it was a public nuisance. On appeal, the court found that the city's restrictions were not a prior restraint triggering greater state constitutional protection. Revoking the club's license was not an impermissible public restraint. The court further found that the city's adult cabaret code provisions, read as a whole, did not sweep any protected expressions within their prohibitions. They were not overbroad or vague. Finally, the court determined that state law did not preempt the city's adult cabaret code provisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought judicial review of a order entered by the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington) granting respondent property owners' motion for summary judgment on liability and dismissing the city's affirmative defenses of the business judgment rule, discretionary governmental immunity, and that the property owners' claims under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 64.40 and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 were barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court rejected the city's claim that the property owners were required to personally serve the amended complaint since it stated a new and different cause of action. The property owners' original complaint was for a writ of mandamus. The amended complaint made claims for damages. The trial court ruled that the damage claims in the amended complaint were based on the same set of facts set forth in the original mandamus action and that personal service was not required. Since the trial court had jurisdiction, the property owners' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim was not barred by the three year statute of limitations. However, the property owners' claim for damages under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 64.40 was barred because the amended complaint was filed more than 30 days after they had exhausted their administrative remedies. The 30-day period in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 64.40.030 had to be strictly complied with. The fact that the amended complaint related back to the original complaint did not save the &sect; 64.40 claim since the property owners had not exhausted their administrative remedies when the original complaint was filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order was affirmed in all respects, except the appellate court reversed the denial of summary judgment on the property owners' state law claim and common law breach of contract claim. The appellate court adhered to its decision in the first appeal and remanded for a trial on damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession of cocaine, and her sentence included a financial obligation. At sentencing, she sought a waiver of all legal financial obligations on grounds that she was disabled, had never been employed, and was unlikely ever to have the means to satisfy any such obligations. The Superior Court, King County, Washington, waived all obligations except the victim's penalty assessment, which was mandatory. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the statute and regulations governing violation hearings did not provide adequate procedural safeguards to ensure she would not be punished if she was unable to pay and that therefore her due process rights were violated. Because she had not yet failed to pay her legal financial obligations, nor been incarcerated or otherwise sanctioned for violating the terms of her community custody, the court held that her due process rights had not been violated and her argument was not yet ripe for review. The court nevertheless noted that, if the defendant was accused of violating the terms of her community custody, she would be entitled to the procedural due process safeguards due in parole revocation hearings and that the regulations governing community custody violation hearings appeared to meet these requirements. The court disagreed with the argument that a hearing officer could invoke sanctions without considering ability to pay, noting that imposition of sanctions without such an inquiry would violate due process and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The regulation permitted a hearing officer to elicit any facts necessary and was consistent with due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two female officers were posing as prostitutes as part of an undercover operation for the police department. According to the two female officers, they had a lengthy discussion with defendant during which he allegedly offered to find them customers, provide them with clothing, and other logistical aide in exchange for a 50-50 split of the profits. Defendant argued that the statutes prohibiting the promotion of prostitution were overbroad, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.88.080 and 9A.88.060. The appellate court ruled that defendant's argument was without merit, as the statutes could only be overbroad if they swept within their grasp constitutionally protected speech, and the Washington Supreme Court had previously held that the promotion of prostitution statutes did not prohibit any constitutionally protected speech. Furthermore, a rational trier of fact could have found that the testimony of the two female officers was sufficient evidence to convict defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant paternal grandmother challenged a judgment of the King County Superior Court (Washington), which granted custody of the child to respondent godmother as being in the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child lived with the paternal grandmother for six years until the grandmother was arrested for growing a large quantity of marijuana. The child was removed from the grandmother's home, and custody of the child was granted to the godmother. The grandmother appealed, arguing that, because she was the child's effective parent, the court was required to find actual detriment to the child before removing her from the grandmother's household. Although the child resided with the grandmother, she was not a parent under any statutory definition, so she was not afforded the presumption of parental fitness under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.10.030. Next, the grandmother claimed that, even under a best interest of the child standard, there was insufficient nonhearsay evidence to change the child's residential placement. However, the court properly determined placement based on the preponderance of the evidence. Continuing to reside with the grandmother was not in the child's best interest because the grandmother consistently used poor judgment when making decisions regarding the child by allowing boarders with untreated mental disorders and alcohol problems to reside in her home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates argued that their sentences violated due process and their right to a jury trial. The appellate court found that the imposition of an exceptional sentence by a judge based on facts not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt was constitutional. The inmates had no procedural due process rights to a standard range sentence, as their liberty interest was qualified. They could not assert that their procedural due process rights were violated by operation of the statute. The inmates had petitions that were time barred under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.090(1), where none of the inmates contested any increase in the mandatory minimum of their sentencing ranges. All of the inmates, except one, filed their petitions more than one year after their direct appeals were mandated. No precedents existed for the claim that the exceptional sentence itself amounted to another crime, preventing the time bar of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.73.100 from applying. There was no basis to equitably toll the time bar, where the inmates failed to produce evidence of bad faith, deception, or false assurances by the State or of lack of due diligence on the part of their appellate counsel.</SPAN></P>

The issue on appeal was that the accomplice liability instruction erroneously stated that a person was liable as an accomplice, if the person had knowledge that his actions would facilitate commission of &quot;a&quot; crime (as opposed to &quot;the&quot; crime). The appellate court held that defendant did not establish that the error had any actual substantial influence on the jury's verdict. The State presented overwhelming evidence that defendant was a principal in each of the crimes charged. While defendant testified at trial that he was merely present while the crimes took place, wearing, as he put it, &quot;mental blinders,&quot; he effectively confessed to active participation in several phases of the ongoing kidnappings and robberies with which he was charged.</SPAN></P>

The State filed writs of certiorari with the superior court, which denied the writs, ruling that Washington statutes and court rules did not grant the State the right to demand a jury trial over a defendant's objection. The court reversed, stating that Washington statutes unambiguously required district courts to hold a jury trial when the State demanded one, Wash. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3.66.010, 10.04.050. And those statutes were not unconstitutional because the Washington Constitution only guaranteed defendants a jury trial, not the right to demand a bench trial. The district court acted contrary to the procedures authorized by the State Legislature, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 10.04.050, 3.66.010.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant reasserted his contention that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94.070 was unconstitutional. The appellate court found that, although &sect; 9.94.070 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 72.09.130 did not require the department of corrections to follow the rulemaking procedures under the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 34.05.010 et seq., the department did so when it repromulgated its disciplinary code. Because of the presence of the procedural safeguards, defendant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating the Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94.070's unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, treating inmates who could not be motivated to obey internal prison rules by the possible loss of early release credit differently from inmates who had potential earned early release credits was justified. Because the latter faced the loss of credit if they committed infractions, they had an incentive to follow prison rules and were less in need of the additional motivation of felony criminal sanctions. Thus, &sect; 9.94.070 was rationally related to maintaining prison discipline despite its inability to deter inmates serving mandatory life sentences from disobeying prison rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to enforce a child support order against defendant father. A court commissioner found the father in contempt for failing to pay support arrearages and ordered him to report to jail unless he paid toward the arrearage. The father appealed, and the Superior Court, King County (Washington) found that absent a continuing obligation, incarceration was not available for enforcing payment of child support arrearages. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State unsuccessfully sought to enforce a child support order against the father before the child reached the age of majority. However, the contempt finding was entered after the child had entered the age of majority. The superior court held that incarceration was not an available remedy under the court's contempt powers to enforce the payment of child support arrearages because there was no current, ongoing support obligation. On appeal, the court disagreed. The court noted that U.S. Const. amend. XIII, &sect; 1, and Wash. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, prohibited incarceration for failure to pay a debt in actions at law in personam. However, the court held that the child support order was an equitable remedy in which the father was ordered to do an act: to pay child support. Because the child support order was an equitable remedy, the constitutional provisions did not bar incarceration as an enforcement tool. The court also noted that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 26.18.040 and 26.18.050(5) jurisdiction over the father was retained even though the child had reached the age of majority. Therefore, the court reversed the superior court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first-degree rape. The child victim blacked out during the attack and was uncertain whether penetration occurred. Thus, at trial, at the close of the evidence, the State amended the charge to attempted rape in the first degree. A jury in the Superior Court of Spokane County, Washington, convicted defendant on the latter offense. Defendant appealed, attacking the amended information, and his sentencing conditions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that, in the case of rape, the definition of attempt included an essential element, intent, that the completed crime did not. He asserted that amending the information in the middle of the trial denied him notice of the intent element, in violation of due process. He contended that denied him the opportunity to present a voluntary intoxication diminished capacity defense to negate the essential element of intent. The appellate court agreed with the State that, because of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.61.003, making attempt a lesser-included offense of every crime, the information put defendant on notice that a jury could convict him of any lesser-included offense of first-degree rape, including attempted first-degree rape. Further, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.61.010, either the State or defendant could have requested a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of attempted rape under the original information. It could not be said that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the amendment. However, the trial court imposed conditions of community custody not authorized by the Washington Sentencing Reform Act of 1981 (SRA), Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.94A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed. However, his sentence was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1998, plaintiff retired state employees sued defendant Washington Department of Retirement Systems, alleging that the Department denied them the opportunity to elect to receive cost-of-living benefits under the old cost-of-living statute, which had been amended in 1995. The Thurston County Superior Court, Washington, dismissed the action, as it was filed more than three years after the 1995 statute became law. The retirees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1995, the legislature repealed all existing cost-of-living adjustment statutes for certain retired employees and enacted a new law, which took effect in July 1995. The 1995 law allowed the Department to pay cost-of-living raises under the repealed statute. The retirees argued that the three-year statute of limitations did not start to run until they were harmed, sometime after 1996 when they first would have received more benefits under the old cost-of-living statute than the new one. They also contended that the discovery rule applied and that the limitations statute did not start to run until they learned, again after 1996, that the Department denied them the right to elect their cost-of-living benefits. The instant court held that the three-year statute of limitations started to run no later than July 1995. Thus, the retirees' claims were barred. All elements of the retirees' claims, including harm, existed at the time the new statute took effect in July 1995. Even if the discovery rule applied, it would not have delayed the running of the statute of limitations, because the retirees knew all the essential facts of their claims in 1995 when the statute took effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action, plaintiffs, a limited partnership, a restaurant, and the owners of the restaurant, appealed a summary judgment of the Snohomish County Superior Court, Washington, granted substantially in favor of defendant city concerning its adoption of an ordinance banning card rooms. The city cross-appealed the trial court's ruling that certain portions of the ordinance were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 1 of the ordinance prohibited the conduct or operation of social card games as commercial stimulants. Section 2 of the ordinance regulated existing social card games and provided that all such games had to cease operation five years after the enactment of the ordinance. The restaurant owners operated a restaurant, bar, and card room facility located in the city. The restaurant had a gambling permit from the Washington Gambling Commission. The owners argued, inter alia, that the ordinance conflicted with Wash. Const. art. XI, &sect; 11, because it was not a reasonable exercise of the city's police power. The instant court concluded that &sect; 1 was a proper exercise of the city's police power. The city's exercise of its police power divested the owners of the claimed vested right to operate a card room. The ordinance did not operate to take property in the constitutional sense, and there were no violations of substantive or procedural due process rights. However, state law preempted the entirety of &sect; 2 because it regulated, rather than prohibited gambling outright. Any regulation pertaining to the scope of gambling activities was under the sole authority of the Gambling Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court affirmed the summary judgment order in part and reversed in part. The instant court affirmed the trial court's decision as to the first section of the ordinance, but it reversed the decision to the extent that it validated portions of the second section.</SPAN></P>

There was direct and circumstantial evidence that defendant acted with specific intent. Defendant lured the victim to the home, turned up the volume on his stereo, and had rope, duct tape, and a bandana handy. Moreover, the evidence showed that defendant was mentally aware. The court determined that defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel. There was no reason to argue merger, as the doctrine did not apply to kidnapping and robbery. Finally, the court determined that the trial court was not required to submit defendant's prior offenses to a jury before using them to enhance his sentence. Prior offenses were specifically excluded from facts that required submission to a jury.</SPAN></P>

Instead, &quot;unwitting possession&quot; was an affirmative defense that defendants must prove by a preponderance of the evidence.

The Thurston County Superior Court, Washington, dismissed plaintiff's suit on summary judgment. The Washington Supreme Court denied plaintiff's petition for direct review and transferred his appeal to the instant court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the State took steps toward suspending plaintiff's driver's license for failure to pay child support, plaintiff filed this action. Plaintiff argued that the bill violated constitutional requirements that a bill contain only one subject and that its title express that subject. He contended that the bill included multiple subjects and that these subjects did not share a rational unity. The instant court noted that the bill, when read in its entirety, broadly encompassed the topic of implementing a specific piece of federal legislation dealing with public assistance. Thus, the bill had a general title. The provisions of the bill were germane to its title and to one another in that they all concerned implementing the federal legislation. Even if the instant court were to view the bill's title as restrictive, it was enforceable because its provisions were &quot;fairly within&quot; the subject of the title. The title's subject referred to the implementation of the legislation and each of the bill's provisions operated to accomplish that purpose. The bill did not violate the single subject requirement. The bill's title also sufficiently stated the single subject matter of the bill.</SPAN></P>

Further, counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a manslaughter instruction, Wash. Rev.

From that evidence alone, no rational jury could have determined that defendant was reckless or negligent.

Code &sect; 10.77.090. Defendant argued that the commitment was improper because the State did not prove the need for civil commitment by clear cogent, and convincing evidence. The appellate court considered the case even though the civil commitment had ended and the charge had been dismissed, because the statutory scheme governing civil commitment was a matter of continuing and substantial public interest. The appellate court then held that the State had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant had committed a violent act sufficient to justify a civil commitment under the statute. Defendant's actions in threatening the bus driver for no apparent reason was sufficient to show the commission of a violent act. The term &quot;violent act&quot; in Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court for Grant County (Washington) of possession of a firearm, maintaining a drug house, a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.402(a)(6), and use of drug paraphernalia, a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.412. He was sentenced to 10 months on each of the 2 felony counts, with the sentences to run concurrently, and a 90-day suspended sentence on the misdemeanor count. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that defendant unlawfully kept or maintained a dwelling for the purpose of storing controlled substances. Inter alia, defendant was renting the residence and no one else was living there, letters addressed to defendant were found, and he admitted that he owned three of the four vehicles parked there. However, the appellate court held that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he maintained the dwelling for the purpose of selling controlled substances. During their search of the dwelling and its surroundings, officers uncovered all of the items necessary to produce methamphetamine, the presence of methamphetamine and the 151 compound consistent with the production of methamphetamine, an electronic scale, and baggies. Officers detected the odor associated with manufacturing methamphetamine. In short, the evidence was sufficient to establish that drugs were kept and measured on the premises, but not that they were sold. Because the record contained insufficient evidence that defendant maintained the residence to sell drugs, the jury was not entitled to convict under that prong of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction for maintaining a drug house was reversed. The case was remanded for retrial on whether defendant maintained or kept the residence for illegal drug activity. The convictions for possession of a firearm and use of drug paraphernalia were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Lewis County, Washington, convicted defendant of vehicular homicide upon defendant's guilty plea. Defendant appealed his enhanced sentence, which was based on prior driving while under the influence convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the State did not present sufficient evidence for the trial court to conclude that he had the three prior driving under the influence (DUI) convictions used as enhancements. The appellate court disagreed, finding the State's evidence bore minimum indicia of reliability, which, especially in the absence of any challenge, proved defendant's three prior DUIs. Thus, the facts proven by the State were deemed acknowledged by defendant. As the purpose of defendant's sentencing hearing was to establish his prior convictions, not to make any factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the vehicular homicide, the trial court did not improperly infringe on defendant's right to remain silent by summarizing the evidence and noting defendant's failure to challenge it. Nor did Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.370(2) (recodified at Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.94A.530(2)), the statute allowing the trial court to infer such acknowledgment, infringe on defendant's right to remain silent. Rather, it simply allowed unchallenged, minimally reliable evidence of prior convictions to preponderate toward proof of a prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

The county moved for summary judgment dismissing all defendants, and the Superior Court of King County, Washington, granted the motion. The individual appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the individual was being arrested, after assaulting two deputies, he was dragged out of his home in handcuffs because he refused to walk. The individual's naked lower body was exposed because his sweatpants came down. The individual subsequently was convicted of assaulting the deputies. The trial court granted the county's summary judgment motion on the grounds that the individual's claims were barred by the individual's conviction and the statute of limitations. The appellate court affirmed the grant of summary judgment. The appellate court held that the findings in the underlying criminal action that the police had not acted with excessive force barred the individual's civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and barred his claims for the tort of outrage. The individual's claims for false arrest, defamation and assault or excessive force were barred by the two year limitation in Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington), which convicted him of two counts of first-degree murder in violation of Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of two counts of first degree murder under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human life in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.32.030(1)(b), and one count of second-degree unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.41.040(1)(b). He claimed that the murder by extreme indifference statute was unconstitutionally void as applied to him, but the court disagreed and affirmed. Defendant argued that the statute must have been found to be unconstitutionally vague as applied to him because it gave no guidance to one deciding whether to shoot, or if he had to let another shoot at him and others. Defendant claimed that he was subjectively unaware of the alleged aggravated recklessness of his acts, but the court stated that defendant's argument was one for the trier of fact. He ignored the fact that he was arguing specific defenses to specific charges and that it was an issue for the jury to resolve. Further, the amended information was not defective because it inferred that more than mere conduct was required; it inferred that there was a mental element as well.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued on appeal that the jury was improperly instructed as to accomplice liability, that the judge made improper comments to the jury, and the 24 month sentence enhancement under Wash.

The appellate court held that (1) although the accomplice liability instruction was improper, it was a harmless error as it did not affect the outcome as the State did not argue that the accomplice liability for delivery could be based on defendant's possession; (2) the judge's response to the jury's inquiry was not improper was it was a correct statement of the law; and (3) &sect; 69.50.435 was not unconstitutional as defendant could have learned the location of the school bus stop before his drug transaction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient filed suit against respondents, doctor and clinic, after experiencing an allergic reaction to a prescription.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the patient failed to produce expert testimony supporting her informed consent claim. On appeal, the patient argued that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.70.050(3)(d) was unconstitutional because the statute required the patient to prove the scope and breach of a duty to obtain informed consent by expert testimony. The patient contended that requiring her to present expert testimony to determine whether a patient had a right to receive a warning about the potential risks associated with taking a drug undermined her constitutional right to determine his or her own treatment. The appellate court rejected the argument. The statute did not govern the private relations between a doctor and patient, or the right of the patient to receive information about the known risks of medical procedures specifically. It merely addressed the necessary elements of proof in an action for damages. It was patient's failure to provide expert testimony, and not any constitutional infirmity of the statute, that required dismissal of her claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant told his former girlfriend he was going to kill her, burned her with a cigarette, and stuffed plastic bags down her throat until she passed out.

The appellate court held that letting the assault conviction stand violated double jeopardy. It was not enough to merge the offenses for sentencing purposes. As to defendant's other claims of error, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the attempted murder conviction. The prosecutor's reference to the testimony of the victim and her son was not a personal opinion and did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct. The victim's statements to police on the date of the incident were properly admitted under Wash. R. Evid. 803 as excited utterances. The Persistent Offender Accountability Act did not violate defendant's right to due process or trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denying defendant's motion to suppress, the Superior Court of Clark County, Washington, convicted defendant of two counts of possessing a controlled substance with intent to deliver.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that the police unlawfully searched his home, as there was no probable cause to believe that methamphetamine would be found in his home, there was no probable cause to believe that evidence of methamphetamine dealing would be found in his home, and the warrant purported to authorize a search for books and records not related to methamphetamine dealing, and, thus, was &quot;overbroad.&quot; Given both the informant's track record and independent corroboration by the police, the appellate court determined that the magistrate had discretion to credit the informant's assertions, to find that defendant probably had methamphetamine in his house, and to issue a warrant for the house. However, the appellate court agreed with defendant that the warrant was overbroad, as it authorized the police to search for items for which there was no probable cause. Nonetheless, in applying the severability doctrine, the appellate court determined that the warrant's overbreadth did not require suppression of the items admitted at trial. Although defendant said he was out of methamphetamine, the police were not required to return to the magistrate to redetermine probable cause.</SPAN></P>

Allegedly, defendant pushed the victim over a balcony, broke a picture frame over her head, and threatened to cut her throat with a piece of glass. He also forced her to ride in her car, which he had permission to use in the past. After defendant was convicted of various crimes, he filed an appeal. On review, the court reversed defendant's second-degree assault conviction. The court determined that defense counsel improperly requested a jury instruction that contained the words &quot;to wit.&quot; Moreover, the failure to object prejudiced defendant, as it caused the trial court to impermissibly comment on the evidence. Moreover, it effectively removed an essential element of the crime from the jury's consideration. As a result, defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel. However, there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.56.070, as the evidence showed that defendant no longer had permission to use the victim's car. Defendant only had permission to use the car during the parties' relationship, which had just ended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was 14 years old, lured a 5 year old girl into a secluded place, choked her until she lost consciousness, and sexually assaulted her by sticking his finger into her vagina. Defendant and the State reached a plea agreement, which defendant alleged required the State to recommend that defendant be eligible for release when he was between 20 and 21. At the dispositional hearing, the State indicated it concurred with the probation report's recommendation that defendant be confined until age 21. Defendant argued on appeal that the State breached the plea agreement. The appellate court held that the agreement was ambiguous and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to conduct a hearing to determine the exact terms of the agreement and whether the State breached it or not. If the trial court determined that the agreement had been breached, defendant was to receive a new dispositional hearing in front of a different judge. If the agreement was not breached, the original sentence could be affirmed. The &quot;unusually cruel&quot; aggravator applied by the trial court was not unconstitutionally vague and was properly applied to defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient sued appellees, her doctors, for operating on her without her informed consent. The Superior Court for King County (Washington) granted the doctors' motion for summary judgment, finding that the patient failed to comply with former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.96.010, which required plaintiffs suing local government entities to have first filed a claim with the entity's governing body. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first issue was whether the clinic that employed the doctors was a &quot;local government entity&quot; as defined by former &sect; 4.96.010. The appellate court held that it was. The statute defined &quot;local government entity&quot; as including &quot;quasi-municipal corporations,&quot; and the clinic fell squarely within the common-law definition of that term. As a quasi-municipal corporation, the clinic was a local government entity subject to the claim filing requirements of former &sect; 4.96.010. Therefore, the patient was required to file a claim before suing sued the entity or its employees acting within the scope of their employment. The appellate court also held that the application of the claim-filing statute did not violate due process in the case at bar, as the patient was on inquiry notice of the clinic's status as a local government entity and the proper claim filing procedure. Finally, the appellate court concluded that statutory amendments requiring local government entities to have appointed agents to have received claims should not have been applied retroactively to the case at bar, because, to have done so, would not have furthered their remedial purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from his entry into a home that was under a decontamination order as a suspected methamphetamine lab. A notice of a decontamination order was posted on the home prohibiting its use and occupancy. Defendant argued that his presence in the home did not furnish probable cause for the arrest. The appellate court ruled that, because the police informed defendant that the order meant he was not to be in the home, and they observed defendant in the basement, the police had probable cause to believe a misdemeanor was being committed in their presence. As there was probable cause to arrest defendant, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant also argued that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that he used or occupied the home in violation of the notice and order. To convict, the jury had to determine whether defendant knowingly entered or remained unlawfully in the home. There was evidence that a detective told defendant the order meant he had to stay out of the home and that defendant admitted he knew he was not supposed to be there.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that his conviction should be reversed due to the trial court's failure to timely enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred in admitting a gun and defendant's statements about the gun and its use, because the evidence was improper as propensity evidence under Wash. R. Evid. 404(b). The appellate court rejected defendant's arguments. The court found that the trial court issued a clear and comprehensive oral opinion that permitted the appellate court to determine how or whether the dispositive factual issues were decided by the trial court. Although the findings and conclusions were entered after defendant's appellate brief was filed, those findings and conclusions mirrored the rulings of the trial court. The court found that the evidence of the gun and defendant's statements was admitted for a showing of intent and plan, not flight. Defendant's statements and the use of a gun indicated his approach or method used for bank robbery and was highly relevant. Therefore, it was more relevant than prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basic ruling on appeal was the trial court's judgment of dismissal entered after a jury verdict for the city. The dismissal encompassed the individuals' and corporation's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief under both the federal and state constitutions. The court previously reversed the judgment of dismissal and remanded for a new trial on the individuals' and corporation's claims for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court had held that the United States Constitution required police to obtain a warrant before arresting nude dancers for violation of the city's standards of conduct ordinance. The supreme court remanded the claim for equitable relief to the court and the court declined the invitation to make a substantive determination about the availability of equitable relief. It remained an open question whether the individuals and corporation were entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief under the state constitution, independently of what the result could be under the federal constitution. The trial court could consider the argument that the warrantless arrests of nude dancers constituted a prior restraint that was invalid under Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of three counts of intimidating a judge. On appeal, his convictions were affirmed. The Superior Court of Walla Walla County (Washington) denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, seeking relief from his convictions. Petitioner appealed, asserting in-part, that he had no &quot;criminal intent&quot; in filing the subject administrative claims, and therefore, was not guilty of intimidating a judge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basis of petitioner's convictions was that he filed a document entitled &quot;certification of administrative foreign judgment&quot; with a county auditor's office. The document named individuals, including three judges, and claimed that defendant was entitled to make a claim against them for over $ 500,000 in damages. Several of petitioner's claims were raised on direct appeal, and therefore, the appellate court declined to revisit those issues. Petitioner contended that the prosecutor improperly charged him with a crime in retaliation for exercising his First Amendment right to redress his grievances. The appellate court disagreed. Petitioner failed to demonstrate that the First Amendment gave him the right to file false liens and &quot;certifications of administrative foreign judgment,&quot; as a means of threatening a judge. Nor did petitioner point to anything in the record showing that the prosecutor's motive in filing the charges was to retaliate against him for engaging in lawful conduct. Petitioner's claims that he had no &quot;criminal intent&quot; to intimidate a judge was rejected, as any rational trier of fact could have inferred that petitioner intended to communicate a threat to his victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, that petitioner was not entitled to habeas corpus relief, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with rape of a child in the first degree, and, in the alternative, attempted rape of a child in the first degree. Following a bench trial in the Superior Court of King County (Washington), defendant was found guilty of attempted rape of a child in the first degree, Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 9A.44.073(1) and 9A.28.020. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court improperly admitted child hearsay statements to, inter alia, the victim's mother, as the statements did not describe any act or attempted act of sexual contact, as required in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.44.120. Before trial, he argued that the child hearsay statements did not describe sexual contact, as there was no evidence that defendant touched the victim with his penis or touched her mouth for the purpose of gratifying sexual desire. The appellate court held that, given the victim's description of the taste test, the discovery of the condoms, defendant's admissions regarding his actions and purpose, and the lack of any other reasonable purpose besides sexual gratification, even with his version that he filled condoms with shampoo and placed them in the mouth of a blindfolded 9-year-old child, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the statements involved an act or attempted act of sexual contact and admitting the hearsay statements. The appellate court also held that a rational fact finder could have found from the evidence that defendant had taken a substantial step toward committing first degree child rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife argued that the trial court erred when it issued an anti-harassment protection order against her, and punished her for violating the &quot;no investigation&quot; order. Former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.14.020(1) (1999) defined unlawful harassment as knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person which seriously alarmed, annoyed, harassed, or was detrimental, and which served no legitimate or lawful purpose. The appellate court found that the wife intentionally made unfounded accusations about the husband designed to create a hostile environment and served no legal purpose.  Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 10.14.080(4) allowed for extended anti-harassment orders where the harassment was likely to resume when the order expired. An order of civil contempt had to contain a purge clause under which a contemnor had the ability to avoid a finding of contempt and/or incarceration for non-compliance. The wife had no ability to purge her contempt. The contempt penalty was punitive and not coercive and was, therefore, not a sanction available. The wife was not entitled to attorney fees where evidence supported the finding that the wife's behavior was intended to harm the husband.</SPAN></P>

The instant court found no evidence of trial court error. It agreed with defendant that the trial court's findings incorrectly stated that she did not make any type of statement prior to receiving her constitutional warnings. The record revealed that defendant told the officers how to find an allegedly stolen vehicle, although it was disputed whether the so-called statement was verbal or nonverbal. Nevertheless, the trial court's ultimate conclusion, regarding lack of threat or coercion regarding defendant's statement, was supported by the record. Regarding defendant's offender score, the parties agreed that defendant had, at a minimum, a score of seven. Defendant was under community placement at the time of the current offense, as she was subject to the conditions of the community custody ordered in her Drug Offender Sentencing Alternative sentence. As a result, defendant's offender score was properly calculated as eight.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While under community supervision by the department of corrections (DOC), defendant caused an automobile accident that killed the decedent. Respondent family of the decedent sued the DOC, alleging, inter alia, negligent community supervision. Following a jury trial court, Pierce County Superior Court (Washington) awarded the family $ 22,453,645 in damages. The DOC appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the DOC argued, inter alia, that the facts did not support finding that the DOC's duty to control the defendant extended to the decedent or that its supervision of the defendant was the proximate cause of the decedent's death. The appellate court rejected these arguments. The family's evidence showed that, while under the DOC's supervision, defendant completely failed to fulfill his court ordered supervision requirements. Defendant had mental health problems that caused his behavior to be erratic and violent, and, while under community supervision, defendant was convicted of possession of stolen property after being pulled over for speeding in a stolen vehicle. This was sufficient evidence for a jury to find it foreseeable that defendant would continue to exercise poor or no judgment, continue to break the law, drive without a valid license, and potentially endanger the lives of others. Further, there was a special duty on the part of the DOC to control the defendant, as there was a clear public policy for imposing liability on the DOC for lax supervision of offenders. Thus, there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find proximate cause and cause in fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On September 14, a superior court commissioner issued a temporary order of protection order (TRO) against defendant for his former girlfriend. On September 16, the girlfriend filed a police report alleging that defendant had violated the TRO. On September 28, a superior court commissioner entered a permanent restraining order against defendant, and he sought revision and dismissal. The superior court found that the girlfriend's petition and supporting affidavit did not set forth the required allegations, and both the temporary and permanent protection orders were vacated on October 13. The city did not appeal the order vacating the temporary and permanent protection orders, and 11 days after the orders were vacated, the city charged defendant with violating the TRO on September 16. The appellate court ruled that the city had no underlying basis to charge defendant, as the city could not charge defendant for violating an order after the order had been vacated, even if the alleged violation occurred while the order was in effect. In other words, the city might have prevailed had it charged defendant for violating the order before it was vacated.</SPAN></P>

The attorney filed the claim. The Thurston County Superior Court, Washington, granted the State's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that appellant failed to personally verify his complaint as required by Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State placed appellant, who was mildly retarded, in foster care from the ages of 7 to 16 years old. During that time, he suffered repeated instances of mental, physical, and sexual abuse. The attorney prepared, verified, signed, and filed the claim against the State, but appellant did not personally verify the information in the claim form. Appellant argued that: (1) &sect; 4.92.100 did not require that he personally verify his tort claim against the State; (2) the State was equitably estopped from raising the claim filing deficiency defense because it provided an outdated claim form and instructions; and (3) the personal verification requirement violated his right to equal protection. Strictly construing the statutory filing requirements, the instant court concluded that the attorney's verification was deficient. The power of attorney did not confer on the attorney any more authority than that of appellant's agent. Appellant failed to present sufficient evidence of his incapacitation to meet the incapacitation exception. Equitable estoppel did not apply because the interpretation of the statute was a legal matter. Appellant did not present an adequate equal protection challenge.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.090, which required proof of a prior conviction for a felony sex offense. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of his prior conviction for a felony sex offense when he was willing to stipulate to that element to avoid having the evidence introduced to the jury. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred by rejecting his proposed jury instruction as to the definition of &quot;immoral purposes&quot; under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.090. The appellate court found that the trial court properly admitted the judgment and sentence related to the prior conviction because defendant did not offer to stipulate that he had a prior conviction for a felony sex offense. Instead, defendant offered to delete any reference to a statutory element that required proof of a prior conviction for a felony sex offense. Sexual misconduct was a sufficient context for the &quot;immoral purposes&quot; contemplated by the communications with a minor under &sect; 9.68A.090. Defendant's counsel's failure to object to certain evidence was a legitimate trial tactic. Defense counsel's questioning of defendant's wife did not result in any prejudice to defendant. Defendant did not submit affidavits from exculpatory witnesses detailing their testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Superior Court, Spokane County (Washington), which arrested him on a bench warrant and convicted him of first-degree escape, pursuant to former Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant failed to report to begin serving his sentence for a felony conviction, but was arrested on a bench warrant and charged with first-degree escape under former Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.110 (1982). A jury convicted him, but, on appeal, he contended that a court-ordered extension of the trial date violated the speedy trial rule. Additionally, he argued that he should have been charged with the more specific crime of failure to return from furlough. He raised additional issues in his consolidated personal restraint petition. The court affirmed, stating that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in granting a five-day trial extension, as he did not argue prejudice. Consequently, he failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the extension based on the deputy prosecutor's surgery, Wash. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 3.3(d)(8). Further, because he was not released on furlough while in custody, he could not be charged with failure to return from furlough. The court concluded that he was not denied due process of law, as he failed to show any prejudice resulting from an allegedly defective bench warrant on the conviction for first-degree escape.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision from the Adams Superior Court County (Washington), which convicted him of escape, burglary, and theft.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was being moved to a holding cell in a police department, he escaped. After defendant was charged with several crimes, he filed a motion to dismiss the escape charge. Defendant was convicted, and the trial court imposed an exceptional sentence. In affirming, the court determined that the motion to dismiss was properly denied because a police department constituted a detention facility under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.76.010(2). Moreover, there was sufficient evidence presented to sustain his conviction on the escape charge. The State was not required to present a witness to testify that the police department was a detention facility. In addition, the trial court did not err in imposing an exceptional sentence. The standard sentencing range would have been &quot;clearly too lenient&quot; based on defendant's high offender score. The trial court was also not required to submit the underlying factual determinations to a jury before imposing the sentence. The court noted that defendant's convictions did not violate double jeopardy because burglary and theft were separate offenses. Finally, the court held that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9A.52.050 was not an unconstitutional bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested along with a female co-defendant, after they sold crack cocaine to an undercover police officer. In a search incident to arrest, a plastic baggie containing 2.44 grams of crack cocaine was found in defendant's underwear and a bindle of heroin weighing .4 grams in his sock. The jury also entered special verdicts finding that the cocaine possession and delivery offenses occurred within 1000 feet of a school bus route stop. Defendant argued on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.50.435(a) was unconstitutionally vague, and that the trial erred in applying the school bus stop enhancement. The appellate court held that the circumstances of the crime and the amount of drugs involved supported the inference that defendant possessed the drugs with intent to deliver. The constitutionality of the statute had been upheld in Coria. Testimony of an official of the school district established that the crime occurred within 1000 feet of an identifiable school bus stop and that defendant could readily determine that fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Snohomish County (Washington) of seven counts of forgery and one count of first degree theft. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain convictions for forgery. The court of appeals disagreed. The checks defendant wrote bore the business's account number and were from the business's bank. Any rational fact-finder could have concluded from that that the checks were drawn from the same account, regardless of which city or bank branch was written on the checks. Even assuming that the accounts were different, defendant admitted that he did not open either of the checking accounts. Mildly stated, his claim -- that to satisfy a debt, a friend had opened two separate checking accounts in defendant's name, deposited money in them, and then gave defendant blank checks bearing his name and address -- strained credulity. The jury was entitled to reject that claim and find that defendant was unauthorized to write checks on either of the two accounts and that he forged the checks. Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, there was sufficient evidence to prove forgery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first degree theft conviction was reversed and remanded for entry of a second degree theft conviction. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant threatened a female police officer, using vicious, vile invectives directed at the officer. The trial judge found that defendant did it because the officer was a woman. Defendant argued that the State did not show that he selected the officer because of her gender. Although defendant conceded that the terms he used were offensive and vulgar, he argued that their meanings did not provide a basis for the trial court's finding that defendant's &quot;method of attack&quot; and threats were made because the officer was a woman. The appellate court concluded that the trial court's determination that defendant threatened to mutilate the officer's sexual organs was supported by substantial evidence. The officer testified and the trial court entered an unchallenged finding that defendant stated that he would slit the officer from her genitalia to her throat. Although defendant argued that because this threat was one of disembowelment rather than mutilation of female genitalia, it was not supported by substantial evidence. A fair-minded, rational person could have easily concluded otherwise. Defendant did not hurl abuse at a male transit officer at the time of the incident.</SPAN></P>
