IV and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because the implied-consent advisory itself was not unconstitutionally coercive; [2]-The use of the term &quot;reinforces&quot; in the State v. Brooks decision indicated that the Minnesota Supreme Court would not have decided the case differently, even if there was no consultation with counsel; [3]-Even though the driver was given a temporary license for a shorter period than was contemplated by Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.52, subd. 7(c), (c)(2) (2012), the revocation could not have been challenged on that basis because judicial review was prohibited for issues that were not listed under Minn.

R. Evid. 803(3); [2]-There was no error under U.S. Const. amend. IV; Minn. Const. art.

Stat. &sect; 169A.40, subd. 1 (2010) because the PBT result showed an alcohol concentration well over the legal limit; [4]-The breath-test evidence obtained after the driver was read the implied-consent advisory was not the product of unlawful coercion.</SPAN></P>
