</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed motions to dismiss defendant's indictments for practicing law without being admitted and as an attorney who was disbarred or suspended, criminal possession of forged instruments and stolen property, and grand larceny in violation of N.Y. Jud. Law &sect;&sect; 478 and 486 and N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 165.60(2) based on insufficiency of evidence, the rule of lenity, duplicity, and lack of jurisdiction or venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lawyer was suspended from the practice of law. Defendant met a client, alleged that he was an attorney, and undertook to prepare and file a mechanic's lien for the client. Defendant signed the client's name to documents without the client's knowledge or authorization. A grand jury indicted defendant for practicing law without being admitted and as a suspended attorney, criminal possession of forged instruments and stolen property, and grand larceny. Defendant filed motions to dismiss based on insufficient evidence, the rule of lenity, duplicity, and lack of jurisdiction or venue. The court denied defendant's motions in part and held that plaintiff state presented legally sufficient evidence to support the charges and that the grand jury was correctly charged. N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 478 was not unconstitutionally vague because it clearly prohibited a non-licensed person from practicing law. The preparation and filing of legal documents and appearing to be an attorney were prohibited. Jurisdiction and venue were proper. The court dismissed the practicing law charges for duplicity and held that a person was able to hold himself out as an attorney without ever practicing law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Judiciary Law &sect; 478&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Judiciary Law &sect; 478, which is not a model of clarity but which clearly prohibits a nonlicensed individual from practicing law by appearing as an attorney in a court of record in New York, rendering legal services, or holding himself or herself out as being entitled to practice law as aforesaid or in any other manner, is not unconstitutionally vague. The prohibited practice of law includes the rendering of legal advice and preparation of legal papers in New York even if performed out of court and with respect to foreign law. While there are grey areas in the law which might render the prosecution of a defendant who inadvertently overstepped such bounds inappropriate on constitutional grounds, the conduct defendant is accused of, preparation in New York of legal documents for filing out of State and holding himself out as an attorney, has been prohibited since at least 1957.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Unauthorized Practice of Law - Duplicitous Counts in Indictment </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a prosecution for, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unauthorized practice of law, the first two counts of the indictment, both of which charge defendant with violating Judiciary Law &sect; 478 within a certain time period by holding himself out as an attorney and by engaging in the practice of law in the Bronx without being duly admitted to practice in New York State, are duplicitous in that both counts charge more than one crime.  While holding oneself out as an attorney and practicing law both violate Judiciary Law &sect; 478 when performed by one not licensed to practice, one can hold oneself out as an attorney without ever actually practicing law. Accordingly, they are separate crimes which must be set forth in separate counts of an indictment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Unauthorized Practice of Law - Venue </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Bronx County is the proper venue for a criminal prosecution for second degree criminal possession of a forged instrument, third degree grand larceny, and third degree criminal possession of stolen property where it is alleged that defendant came to the complainant's apartment in the Bronx; misrepresented that he was authorized to practice law for the purpose of obtaining a $ 4,000 retainer, $ 1,000 of which was then paid; and thereafter signed the complainant's name to a mechanic's lien and related documents and filed them in New Jersey without showing them to the complainant and without his authority, even though there was no evidence that the documents were issued or forged or possessed by the defendant in the Bronx.  The original misrepresentation, which evidences the defendant's intent to defraud or deceive, took place in the Bronx, and the forgery then helped perpetuate this misrepresentation. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment against him under N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 353-a, which related to aggravated cruelty to animals, arguing that statute was unconstitutional as vague and overbroad, violating due process provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the New York State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was seen to kick a young dog down the walkway, then pick it up and throw it up against a brick wall. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss his indictment under N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect; 353-a because the statute defining the aggravated cruelty to animals offense was vague and overbroad, violating due process provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and the state constitution. The Constitution did not require impossible standards. It was enough that language conveyed sufficiently definite warnings to proscribe conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. Courts were allowed to apply a reasonable construction to carry out legislative intent and to sustain the validity of a statute. Whether or not a statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied, the actual conduct of the person attacking the statute must be considered, and not with respect to hypothetical situations at the periphery of the statute's scope or with respect to the conduct of other parties who might not be forewarned by the broad language. A person of ordinary intelligence would realize defendant's alleged conduct was precisely the sort of activity intended to be covered by the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Motion to dismiss was denied, because the language used in the statute to define &quot;aggravated cruelty&quot; conveyed sufficiently definite warnings to proscribe conduct when measured by common understanding and practices, and when specifically applied to defendant's alleged conduct, which was to kick a dog and throw it against a wall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353-a&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353-a, which makes it a felony to intentionally kill or intentionally cause serious physical injury to a companion animal with aggravated cruelty and no justifiable purpose, is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.  The term &quot;aggravated cruelty&quot; is defined in the statute as conduct intended to cause extreme physical pain, or conduct done or carried out in an especially depraved or sadistic manner. Although the phrases &quot;extreme physical pain&quot; and &quot;especially depraved or sadistic manner&quot; are not defined within the statute, the failure to define every word in a criminal statute does not make the statute unconstitutionally vague. The phrase &quot;extreme physical pain&quot; uses ordinary terms to express ideas that find adequate interpretation in everyday usage and understanding, and it is not so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.  Similarly, a person of ordinary intelligence, when considering the phrase &quot;especially depraved or sadistic manner&quot; as a whole, would understand what conduct is prohibited by the statute.  &quot;Depraved&quot; and &quot;sadistic&quot; have a common meaning in everyday usage, and although describing these words with the intensive &quot;especially&quot; may be superfluous, when considered together the combined words convey the clear intent to punish only the most serious and egregious conduct.  </SPAN></P>

A person of ordinary intelligence would realize that defendant's actions are precisely the sort of actions intended to be covered by the statute.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was issued three summonses for violations of New York City, N.Y., R. tit. 34, &sect; 4-12(j)(1), which barred the operation of vehicles solely for the purpose of displaying commercial advertising. Defendant moved to dismiss the summonses, arguing the rule violated U.S. Const. amend. I as an impermissible restriction on commercial speech. The court held commercial speech was afforded less constitutional protection than noncommercial speech. The court held the rule at issue satisfied the four-part Central Hudson test for commercial speech regulation. Plaintiff asserted a substantial governmental interest, as the purpose of the rule was to promote traffic safety and alleviate traffic congestion. The court held the rule at issue advanced plaintiff's substantial interest, as there was a direct correlation between the vehicles removed from the streets and a decrease in traffic. The court held the rule was not more extensive than necessary, because exceptions to the rule allowed businesses that wished to advertise to have a means to accomplish their result, such as advertising on buses and taxis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the summonses, because the rule banning the use of vehicles for advertising did not violate the First Amendment, as the rule was not unnecessarily broad, and was meant to help control traffic congestion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Regulation - Prohibition of Vehicles Used Solely for Commercial Advertising </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The failure of the Board of Aldermen of the City of New York in enacting the predecessor to RCNY 4-12 (j) (1), which prohibits the operation on City streets of vehicles used solely for the purpose of commercial advertising, to include legislative findings that identify the substantial interest sought to be advanced by the restriction on commercial advertising, does not render the rule unconstitutional.  A governmental body is not required to make any specific type of legislative findings or even to specify its purpose contemporaneously with the enactment of legislation that regulates commercial speech. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Regulation - Prohibition of Vehicles Used Solely for Commercial Advertising </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. RCNY 4-12 (j) (1), which prohibits the operation on City streets of vehicles used solely for the purpose of commercial advertising, does not violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution as an impermissible restriction on commercial speech. In reviewing a regulation that impinges on commercial speech, a court must determine whether the speech concerns lawful activity and is not misleading, whether the asserted government interest is substantial, whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.  Although RCNY 4-12 (j) (1) does not purport to ban only advertising that concerns unlawful activity or is misleading, the government's interest in the regulation of traffic is substantial, the rule advances the government's interest in controlling traffic in that the ban on advertising-only vehicles lessens the amount of potential traffic on City streets, and the rule is narrowly and appropriately tailored.  Businesses that wish their advertisements to be seen on City streets but are prohibited from operating vehicles solely for that purpose have a means available to accomplish that result through the purchase of advertisements on buses, taxis or sanitation trucks, as well as the purchase of stationary billboard space.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating New York City, N.Y., Rules of the City of New York, tit. 21, &sect; 1050.4(c) by selling farecards to other users and taking money from others and then using farecard to allow those persons to enter subway.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was seen receiving money from individuals in exchange for which he swiped a farecard through the turnstile in order to allow them to enter the subway. On another occasion, defendant was seen selling a farecard. The violations were combined for disposition. New York City, N.Y., Rules of the City of New York, tit. 21, &sect; 1050.4(c) contained a generalized prohibition that did not distinguish between conduct calculated to cause harm and conduct that was essentially innocent, thereby failing to give adequate notice of forbidden conduct. Therefore, the charge that defendant &quot;allowed&quot; persons who had given him money to enter the subway by swiping a farecard was dismissed, because it relied on the unconstitutionally vague portion of the statute. The charge that defendant sold a farecard did not need to be dismissed, because the portion of the statute which prohibited sales was not vague.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Regulation - Vagueness - Unauthorized Sale of Transit Authority Fare Media </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. That portion of 21 NYCRR 1050.4 (c) which prohibits the unauthorized sale of fare media (i.e., the various instruments issued by or on behalf of the New York City Transit Authority to use for the payment of fare, including tokens, passes, farecards, transfers, tickets and vouchers) provides people of ordinary intelligence with adequate notice of the forbidden conduct, and offers objective standards to law enforcement personnel, and therefore is not unconstitutionally vague. Accordingly, an accusatory instrument which alleges that defendant sold a MetroCard need not be dismissed.  Only &quot;authorized agents&quot; of the Authority may accept or solicit compensation for the use of time-based MetroCards (i.e., cards permitting an unlimited number of uses in a certain time period); there is no similar restriction for value-based cards. Although defendant suggests that section 1050.4 (c)'s prohibition against the sale of MetroCards is applicable to time-based cards only, and that, therefore, the violation information is facially insufficient because it does not state which type of MetroCard was sold by defendant, section 1050.4 (c) makes unlawful the unauthorized sale of all fare media. Defendant has failed to provide any support for the proposition that when the Authority adopted its tariff, it intended to amend section 1050.4 (c) by permitting the sale of value-based cards. Therefore, there is no need to state which type of MetroCard is being sold.  The accusatory instrument is facially sufficient and shall not be dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. That portion of 21 NYCRR 1050.4 (c) which forbids &quot;authoriz[ing] access to or use of&quot; the subway is unconstitutionally vague, since this generalized prohibition does not distinguish between conduct calculated to cause harm and conduct that is essentially innocent. Accordingly, it fails to give adequate notice of what conduct is forbidden. In addition, this portion of the rule affords law enforcement personnel total discretion in determining whom they will arrest. The violation information does not allege that defendant sold a MetroCard, but that he &quot;allow[ed]&quot; certain persons who had given him money to enter the subway station by swiping a MetroCard.  Because the accusatory instrument relies upon the &quot;authoriz[ing] access&quot; language--the portion of section 1050.4 (c) which is unconstitutionally vague--it is dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

Since &sect; 52 was invalid, the court allowed television cameras and still photos in the court, but imposed standards and safeguards, under &sect; 218 and other administrative rules, for the audio-visual coverage designed to protect the rights of all parties to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. County Court has the authority to hear the application by the proposed intervenors, members of the press, for permission to televise and photograph defendant's trial and any postconviction proceedings.  Barred by Civil Rights Law &sect; 52 from entering the public courtroom with their video and audio equipment, the broadcast media are most directly affected by the statute and, thus, are in the best position to argue its unconstitutionality. Important interests are best championed by those most directly affected by their impairment, and the fact that there may be other forums in which similar relief may be obtained does not diminish County Court's authority to do likewise.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In determining an application by the proposed intervenors, members of the press, for permission to televise and photograph defendant's trial and any postconviction proceedings, County Court need not determine whether the ban against audio-visual coverage in the courtroom of judicial proceedings contained in Civil Rights Law &sect; 52 violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as independent and controlling authority may be found in article I, &sect; 8 of the New York Constitution.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. New York's constitutional free press provision (NY Const, art I, &sect; 8), with roots deeper and older than those of the Federal Constitution's First Amendment, forms an appropriately independent State constitutional basis for evaluating Civil Rights Law &sect; 52, which bans audio-visual coverage in the courtroom of judicial proceedings.  Textually different from the First Amendment, article I, &sect; 8 of the New York Constitution begins by affirmatively stating New Yorkers' rights to freedom of speech and of the press, followed by a prohibition that no legislative enactment may be passed abridging them.  There is no such affirmative statement in the First Amendment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Audio-Visual Coverage of Judicial Proceedings - Ban against Coverage is Unconstitutional under New York Constitution </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Civil Rights Law &sect; 52, which bans audio-visual coverage in the courtroom of judicial proceedings, violates the New York Constitution.  Article I, &sect; 8 of the New York Constitution affirmatively recites every citizen's rights to freedom of speech and of the press, and prohibits the passage of any law which would &quot;restrain or abridge the liberty of speech or of the press.&quot; Civil Rights Law &sect; 52 restrains and abridges the liberty of the press by controlling how television and radio journalists may report the trial; it diminishes and reduces the scope of their coverage. Moreover, the statute's own legislative history supports the conclusion that Civil Rights Law &sect; 52 is unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Audio-Visual Coverage of Judicial Proceedings - Applicability of Ban against Coverage to Still Photography </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The ban against audio-visual coverage in the courtroom of judicial proceedings contained in Civil Rights Law &sect; 52 does not apply to the taking of still photographs and images.  Accordingly, in a proceeding to determine an application by the proposed intervenors, members of the press, for permission to televise and photograph defendant's trial and any postconviction proceedings, the application by one of the proposed intervenors to have a photographer take still photographs during the trial is granted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courts - Audio-Visual Coverage of Judicial Proceedings - Fair Trial Considerations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. In a proceeding to determine an application for permission to televise and photograph defendant's trial and any postconviction proceedings, the proposed intervenors, members of the press whose application was granted, must comply with County Court's guidelines for audio-visual coverage, which are tailored to the specifics of defendant's case but are otherwise identical to Rules of the Chief Administrator of the Courts (22 NYCRR) part 131.  By declaring Civil Rights Law &sect; 52, which bans audio-visual coverage in the courtroom of judicial proceedings, unconstitutional, County Court must institute standards and safeguards to be utilized for the audio-visual coverage of the case designed to protect the rights of all parties to a fair trial. The guidelines for audio-visual coverage contained in Rules of the Chief Administrator of the Courts (22 NYCRR) part 131 well served fair-trial interests during the 10-year experiment with cameras in the courtroom. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's request for a writ of mandamus. Petitioner filed an action asking the court to compel respondent Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to issue a renewal driver's license to petitioner.

In this case, the court held that respondent did not have the discretion to renew a driver's license without a social security number. Furthermore, the court held that petitioner's disclosure of his social security number was not a violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C.S. &sect; 552A.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Mandamus does not lie to compel the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to issue a driver's license to an applicant who refuses, on privacy grounds, to supply his Social Security number and who alleges that he is a noncommercial driver and is not liable for child support. Petitioner has not established a clear right to relief and is explicitly asking that the Commissioner of DMV perform a discretionary act that is not premised on any specific authority.  Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 502 was amended to require all applicants for driver's licenses and renewal licenses to include their Social Security numbers on their application, and the Legislature did not include any exceptions.  The Commissioner, therefore, is mandated to enforce the statutory provisions as written and cannot be compelled to make any exceptions.  The fact that petitioner is a noncommercial driver and has no children and no child or marital support obligations is irrelevant.  To the extent that petitioner may seek to challenge the constitutionality of section 502, a CPLR article 78 proceeding is not the proper method of testing the general constitutionality of a statute.  The Commissioner's refusal to process petitioner's license renewal application, based upon petitioner's refusal to comply with the provisions of section 502, does not constitute a denial of due process.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Driver's License - Refusal of Applicant to Provide Social Security Number - Federal Privacy Claim </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. An applicant for a driver's license who refused on privacy grounds to provide his Social Security number, and was therefore denied a license renewal, has no claim under the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">see generally,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;5 USC &sect; 552a). Although the protection afforded by the Act is broad, its civil remedy provision is far less expansive and does not apply against State agencies or State or local officials.  Federal law provides that a State may, in the administration of any driver's license law, utilize Social Security numbers for identification purposes and may require disclosure as a condition of obtaining a driver's license. The personal identifying information that is regulated by Federal law is a thing in interstate commerce; the sale or release of that information in interstate commerce is therefore the proper subject of congressional regulation; and Congress in enacting the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, which regulates the disclosure of personal information contained in the records of State motor vehicle departments, did not run afoul of the principles of Federalism contained in the Constitution.  Petitioner's concern regarding the sharing of identifying information, including Social Security numbers, as permitted under the Driver's Privacy Protection Act by the Department of Motor Vehicles, does not establish any right to a renewal license, in the absence of furnishing his Social Security number, as required by Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 502.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor Vehicles - Driver's License - Refusal of Applicant to Provide Social Security Number - Right to Interstate Travel </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The denial of a driver's license to an applicant who refused on privacy grounds to provide his Social Security number, and who alleged that he is a noncommercial driver who cannot be liable for child support, did not deprive the applicant of his right to interstate travel. The applicant does not have a fundamental right to drive a motor vehicle, and the Department of Motor Vehicles did not unconstitutionally impede his right to interstate travel by denying him a driver's license. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor news station applied for an order seeking permission to conduct gavel to gavel audio/visual coverage of a civil trial. The court found that it had to determine whether N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 52, which prohibited televising proceedings in which the testimony of witnesses by subpoena could be taken, required them to deny the application. The court found that N.Y. Civ. Rights Law &sect; 52, which made no provision for consent of those who testified by compulsion, was unconstitutional as being arbitrary and capricious by denying free speech in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. I and the N.Y. Constitution, art. I, &sect; 8. The court additionally determined that N.Y. Civ.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Civil Rights Law &sect; 52, which prohibits the televising of judicial proceedings, is unconstitutional.  The ban prohibits televising proceedings in which witnesses may be compelled to testify, but no provision is made for consent of those who testify by compulsion. On that basis alone, section 52 is unconstitutional as being arbitrary and capricious by denying constitutional free speech protections.  The initial adoption of section 52 was unconstitutional.  Further, the failure to include safeguards to ameliorate the effect of denying coverage to a segment of the press in the face of consent, by those required to participate in the proceeding, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Additionally, section 52 has no application in the instant civil claim because the mere possibility of compulsory appearance is insufficient to withhold the broadcast. A determination must be made whether the issuance of a judicial subpoena will be withdrawn by its applicant-intervenor or struck by the court.  The word &quot;may,&quot; when addressing compulsory process, is itself sufficiently indefinite as to be arbitrary and capricious. The public need for the telecast of the proceedings is clear: as many as 1.3 million people may be directly or indirectly affected by the outcome of this trial, and confining the courtroom to its seating capacity will not foster this need.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant used certain explosives and magazines to mine sand and gravel and for excavation and construction projects. These explosives were an integral part of defendant's business. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms had taken the position that the felony conviction prohibited possession by defendant of such explosives and detonating devices. Defendant sought a certificate of relief from civil disabilities under the New York State Correction Law rather than federal law because the provisions in the federal law were not available to them.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> County Court does not have the authority to issue a certificate of relief from civil disabilities pursuant to Correction Law &sect; 702 (1) to a corporate defendant convicted in Federal court and prohibited from using the explosives that are an integral part of its business because of the conviction.  The plain language of the statute, which states that &quot;[a]ny court of this state may, in its discretion, issue a certificate of relief from disabilities to an eligible offender for a conviction that occurred in such court, if the court ... imposed a revocable sentence,&quot; limits County Court's ability to provide such relief. The statute does not deny equal protection of the law to a citizen whose conviction is obtained in Federal court, because the remedy can be obtained through an application to the Board of Parole for &quot;any eligible offender who resides within this state and whose judgment of conviction was rendered by a court in any other jurisdiction&quot; (Correction Law &sect; 703 [1] [b]).  Moreover, State courts should not be required to accept applications for certificates for relief in connection with Federal convictions and act upon them without the type of information that would be available to Federal authorities just because Federal certificates of relief are unavailable due to a Federal regulation which expressly excludes funding and appropriations for the processing of such certificates. A challenge to the authority which promulgated the regulations prohibiting the funding of such activity would be the more appropriate remedy. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the court on an order to show cause brought by plaintiff State of New York and plaintiff New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The State alleged a public nuisance and sought a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from accepting, receiving, or storing any additional asphalt, asphalt emulsion, or other asphalt product or derivative. The issue presented was whether the nuisance could be reliably and effectively abated by the defendants through the installation of equipment which they sought to employ or whether the grant of the preliminary injunction was the only effective remedy. Defendants had 14 years of failed attempts to address the situation. Their efforts could not be characterized as being in good faith. Defendants' approach in the lawsuit, and it appeared throughout the last 14 years, had been to trivialize the legitimate complaints of its neighbors and to engage in only minimal efforts to resolve the problem. Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction was granted.

The asphalt comes to the plant in heated rail cars or tankers and is transferred to storage tanks where it continues to be heated. It is then transferred to the tanker truck for consumption in a heated state.  Under these circumstances, the heating of the asphalt is not processing, but merely a necessary condition for handling of the material.

Although there is no objective standard by which it can be determined whether something is &quot;unreasonably odorous,&quot; when linked with the language in the ordinance prohibiting the emission of substances that are detrimental to the health, well-being and general safety of the community, the Town's ordinance is sufficiently &quot;informative on its face&quot; to be constitutional under the void-for-vagueness doctrine.  </SPAN></P>

The conduct of defendants in allowing the continued emission of noxious odors and fumes from the facility has caused deleterious health effects and discomfort to a considerable number of persons in the vicinity of the facility, and has caused the public irreparable harm.  Furthermore, in fashioning a remedy in a public nuisance action, the court need not address the economic impacts of the preliminary injunction. In the context of a public nuisance lawsuit, the rule in New York is that the nuisance will be enjoined despite a marked disparity between the effect of the injunction and the effect of the nuisance. In this case, defendants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed remedial measures will effectively rectify the problem of noxious odors and fumes. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant employees sought to recover overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 201 et seq., plus liquidated damages and attorney fees, and defendant state alleged that the Court of Claims Act (Act) precluded claims arising more than 180 days prior to filing the claims. The court held that, although the Act waived defendant's sovereign immunity to suit under FLSA, defendant was entitled to condition its waiver upon compliance with the Act's time limitation. The FLSA did not override defendant's immunity and, pursuant to defendant's conditional waiver, the court lacked jurisdiction to consider claims accruing prior to the limitation period. Also, because defendant's waiver placed it in the position of a private employer, liquidated damages under FLSA were available to claimants, and the Act's prohibition on attorneys' fees awards did not apply because the prohibition was not a limitation of the immunity waived by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. A claim against the State seeking unpaid overtime compensation, liquidated damages and attorneys' fees pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 USC &sect; 201 [FLSA]) is subject to the six-month Statute of Limitations contained in Court of Claims Act &sect; 10 (4).  The State's waiver of its sovereign immunity, which extends to claims for wages under the FLSA, is conditioned upon compliance &quot;with the limitations of this article&quot; (Court of Claims Act &sect; 8).  Thus, the State's waiver of immunity is expressly conditioned upon meeting the jurisdictional limitations contained in Court of Claims Act article II, including the limitations in section 10 as to timely service and filing of a claim. </SPAN></P>

The State, having waived its sovereign immunity with regard to FLSA actions except as otherwise conditioned in Court of Claims Act article II, is subject to the provisions of the FLSA authorizing the recovery of counsel fees.  The proscription against the award of attorneys' fees contained in Court of Claims Act &sect; 27 is inapplicable, because section 27 is contained in article III, not article II of the Court of Claims Act. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the People, moved the court for an order pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.27(13)(b) directing the defendant to file a notice if the defense intended to offer psychiatric evidence at the capital punishment penalty phase of defendant's trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was facing a charge that potentially included capital punishment. Plaintiff, the People, submitted a motion for an order requiring defendant to file notice, as required under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.27(13)(b), if he intended to submit psychiatric evidence at the penalty phase of his trial. Defendant opposed the motion, arguing the notice should be required after the guilt/innocence phase of defendant's trial and that the statute was unconstitutional under both the United States Constitution and the New York State Constitution. The court found defendant failed to meet his &quot;heavy burden&quot; required to prove the statute was unconstitutional. Moreover, since the language of N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.27(13)(b) was mandatory that such notice be submitted within a reasonable time prior to trial, the court granted the People's motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the People's motion, finding that notice pursuant to the statute was mandatory; the court also rejected defendant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because defendant offered no precedent nor argument that met the &quot;heavy burden&quot; required to prove a statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Constitutionality of Death Penalty Sentencing Provision Requiring Timely Service of Notice of Intent to Offer Psychiatric Evidence at Penalty Phase </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.  CPL 400.27 (13) (b), which provides that when either party intends to offer psychiatric evidence at the sentencing phase of a capital case the party must, within a reasonable time prior to trial, serve upon the other a written notice of intent to present psychiatric evidence, is not unconstitutional.  A statute is presumed valid, and invalidity must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.  Here, the defense offers no precedent or argument that meets the heavy burden required.  There is no real showing that the provision drives a wedge between an attorney and client. Also, the defense fails to convincingly argue how the statute unfairly discriminates between wealthy and less affluent attorneys, and why such discrimination, if it exists, is unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes - Sentence - Death Penalty - Notice of Intent to Offer Psychiatric Evidence </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In a capital murder case, defense counsel's request to defer service of a notice of intent to offer psychiatric evidence at the penalty phase of the trial, until completion of the guilt-innocence phase, is denied.  Under CPL 400.27 (13) (b), a party &quot;must&quot; serve the notice within a &quot;reasonable time prior to trial.&quot; The language of the statute is mandatory. Requiring the notice, and the statement specifying the witnesses and the nature and type of psychiatric evidence sought to be introduced, does not implicate defendant's right to remain silent or his right to counsel. The notice requirements allow the People to prepare their case in a timely manner (a fair and orderly way) and to anticipate and plan for possible psychiatric mitigation issues, while eliminating the need to assemble and prepare potential assets and resources for mitigation issues that will not be raised.  The notice also furthers the court's ability to comply with CPL 400.27 (1), which requires the court to promptly conduct the sentencing proceeding upon conviction.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporate owner of solid waste disposal facility sought review of respondent state environmental agency's order denying petitioner's application to expand a solid waste disposal facility. Respondent had determined that neither petitioner, nor any of the individuals who owned it, were fit to operate the facility with an expansion permit and that the expansion was not necessary to serve the public interest since the requisite increase in landfill capacity which petitioner forecasted could be satisfied through alternative means. These determinations were fully supported in the record and fully articulated in respondent's decisions and were neither arbitrary, capricious, nor otherwise unlawful. Thus, granting the application produced no countervailing benefit to the public interest sufficient to outweigh petitioner's lack of fitness. Since the remaining issues concerned whether respondent's determinations were supported by substantial evidence, the case was transferred to the appropriate appellate division.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Conservation - Solid Waste Management Facility - Denial of Expansion Permit because of Prior Tax Evasion Convictions - &quot;Direct Relationship&quot; between Criminal Offenses and Permit Application </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The determination of respondent Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) denying petitioner's application for a permit to expand a solid waste disposal facility, on the ground that the felony conviction of petitioner and its three principals on various tax evasion charges disqualified petitioner and its principals as unfit, is neither arbitrary nor capricious and should therefore be confirmed.  The &quot;direct relationship&quot; exception to Correction Law &sect; 752, which otherwise prohibits denying a permit to a person previously convicted of a crime solely because of the conviction, applies to petitioner's permit application, since there was a &quot;direct relationship&quot; between the criminal offenses and the expansion permit being sought.  The nature of the criminal conduct, which involved the filing of false and fraudulent information, has a direct bearing on petitioner's fitness to manage and operate a waste disposal facility, which, by its nature, requires the filing of honest and accurate information with DEC.  Moreover, the spectre of mismanagement of a waste disposal facility, whether because of ineptitude or dishonesty, involves an unreasonable risk to the safety and welfare of the general public. In addition, petitioner failed to prove that its constitutional right to equal protection of the laws was violated because other applicants with similar criminal records had allegedly been allowed to operate facilities pursuant to a management trust arrangement like that proposed by petitioner.  </SPAN></P>

There is no preemption, as Congress has not fully legislated on the subject, nor is there any conflict between the tax imposed and the policy set forth in the Federal statute.  Moreover, the contract here is with an agency of the State of Connecticut, and there is no proof of any violation or undue burden with regard to the Interstate Horseracing Act. </SPAN></P>

Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law &sect; 318 (4), which imposes a tax on harness racing fees received by plaintiff Yonkers Racing Corporation for simulcasting its races to Connecticut off-track betting operators, is an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. To be valid, a State tax affecting interstate commerce must have a sufficient nexus to the activity being taxed in the State, be fairly apportioned, not discriminate against interstate commerce, and be fairly related to the benefits provided.  A facially discriminatory tax may still survive Commerce Clause scrutiny if it is a truly compensating tax designed simply to make interstate commerce bear a burden already borne by intrastate commerce. To sustain a discriminatory tax, the State must identify the intrastate burden it is attempting to compensate for, show that the tax on interstate commerce is roughly approximate to the tax on intrastate commerce, and show that the events taxed are substantially equivalent.  The State has failed to demonstrate any roughly equivalent tax on intrastate simulcasting of horse races to in-State off-track betting locations.  Therefore, the tax is discriminatory, and not compensatory, and violates the Commerce Clause.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Civil Rights Law &sect; 52, which imposes an absolute ban on all audio-visual coverage in the courtroom, is unconstitutional under the Federal and the New York Constitutions.  The First Amendment of the United States Constitution requires that all criminal trials must be open to the press and public absent compelling and clearly articulated reasons for closing such proceedings, and article I, &sect; 8 of the New York Constitution insures the right of the press and the public to view court proceedings.  Audio-visual coverage of civil and criminal proceedings had been permitted during the 10-year period when Judiciary Law former &sect; 218 was in effect, but the Legislature failed to reenact section 218 when it expired in 1997 despite various mandated reports recommending that it be permanently enacted.  As a result, Civil Rights Law &sect; 52 once again became the law and a monument to politically created procrastination and inaction. Accordingly, in light of the Legislature's inaction, it is up to the courts to determine whether Civil Rights Law &sect; 52 is no longer constitutional in light of the presumptive right of the press to televise, and the public to view, court proceedings.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The New York City Department of Investigation (DOI) has jurisdictional authority to conduct an investigation of petitioners, private businesses licensed by the Department of Consumer Affairs as either scrap metal processors or secondhand dealers, and to issue subpoenas for those licensed businesses to produce documents in furtherance of said investigation.  The fact that petitioners are private entities neither employed by nor in contractual privity with the City does not shield them from DOI's investigative power, as contained in New York City Charter &sect; 803 and Executive Order No. 16.  The industries petitioners are involved in are heavily regulated because of their historical connection to trafficking in, and the sale of, stolen property.  As entities licensed by a City agency, an investigation into petitioners' business activities is essentially an investigation into the &quot;affairs&quot; and &quot;functions&quot; of a City agency (NY City Charter &sect; 803 [b]), since such investigation has a &quot;legitimate and reasonable relation&quot; to the critical agency function of determining the suitability and business integrity of license applicants and holders. Moreover, the clear and express language of Executive Order No. 16 authorizes DOI to investigate and eliminate corrupt or other criminal activity, unethical conduct or misconduct &quot;by persons regulated by&quot; the City.  Here, DOI is investigating six entities licensed and thus regulated by the City, and allegedly owned and operated by an individual whom DOI believes may be engaged in criminal or corrupt activity, or unethical conduct or misconduct, based on, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">inter alia,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the discovery of stolen auto parts on premises operated pursuant to a license issued to that individual, a failure to maintain records as required by statute, information that the sale of certain licensed businesses may have been sham transactions, and the individual's purported ties to organized crime. </SPAN></P>

DOI has established a sufficient factual basis for its joint investigation with DCA into the propriety of the current and continuing licensing of the owner of the businesses and the entities in which he maintains an interest, which are in industries heavily regulated due to concerns about criminal activity. The materials sought are relevant to the inquiry into whether the businesses in question were being, or had been, operated in a lawful manner, by persons of requisite character and fitness.  </SPAN></P>

DOI has established authority, relevancy, and some basis for the inquisitorial action which necessarily mitigates against any claim of unjustified harassment. </SPAN></P>

The subpoenas are sufficiently limited in scope, relevant in purpose, and specific in directive so that compliance will not be unreasonably burdensome, which is all that is required by the Fourth Amendment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the State's claim that he violated the N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect;353 when he docked his puppy's tail himself using a rubber band to accomplish the result.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect;353 was unconstitutionally vague because a person of common intelligence could not ascertain what conduct was proscribed by the statute. Defendant stated he thought it was all right to dock his puppy's tail himself. Unfortunately, the puppy had to be euthanized due to the condition of its tail. Defendant's motion to dismiss the State's lawsuit was granted. The court held docking a dog's tail did not require professional supervision, and appellant was only required to avoid &quot;unjustifiable physical pain&quot; and &quot;suffering,&quot; pursuant to N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts. Law &sect;350(2), when engaging in such conduct. The statutory words &quot;unjustifiably&quot; and &quot;unjustifiable&quot; as applied to the conduct of defendant were in violation of the Due Process Clause due to vagueness because a reasonable person in defendant's circumstances would not have notice his conduct placed him at risk of violating the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to dismiss was granted; docking a dog's tail without the assistance of a veterinarian was not proscribed by statute. Applicable statute was constitutionally vague as applied to defendant and the act of docking a dog's tail was not conduct calculated to cause harm but, rather, essentially innocent conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law - Validity of Statute - Vagueness of Agriculture and Markets Law &sect;&sect; 353 and 350 (2)&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 353, which makes it a misdemeanor to unjustifiably torture, injure, maim or kill any animal, and section 350 (2), which defines torture or cruelty as every act, omission or neglect whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death is caused or permitted, are unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant who used a rubber band to dock his puppy's tail, which became infected and resulted in euthanization of the puppy. Vagueness challenges to statutes which do not involve First Amendment freedoms are examined in light of the facts of the case.  The statute must provide sufficient notice to a person of ordinary intelligence of what conduct is prohibited.  The Agriculture and Markets Law permits justifiable maiming or mutilation such as clipping a dog's ears. Ear clipping and tail docking are common practices, and docking a tail is not implicitly proscribed by statute.  However, the statute prescribes that the ear clipping procedure be done by a veterinarian, but no procedure is prescribed for tail docking. Thus, an ordinary person of common intelligence is only required to avoid &quot;unjustifiable physical pain&quot; and &quot;suffering&quot; (Agriculture and Markets Law &sect; 350 [2]) when engaging in such conduct.  Moreover, the prefix modifier &quot;un&quot; before the term &quot;justified&quot; offers no guidance because the term &quot;justified&quot; is undefined. This generalized law fails to distinguish between conduct calculated to cause harm and conduct that is essentially innocent, thereby failing to give adequate notice of what conduct is prohibited.  </SPAN></P>
