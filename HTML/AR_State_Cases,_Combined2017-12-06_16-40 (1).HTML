The surgeon filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that the patient's claims were time barred by the two-year statute of limitations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was 18-years-old at the time he filed the complaint. He alleged that the surgeon had negligently performed a procedure on him and failed to diagnose and treat subsequent complications that resulted form the procedure. The patient was 13-years-old at the time of the surgery. On appeal, the patient contended that the trial court erred in granting appellee's motion for summary judgment. He argued that his claim was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-203 (1987). The appellate court determined that 1991 statute which amended the 1987 statute applied. The 1991 Act did not include the provision which allowed claims by minors to be brought until their 19th birthday. Thus, the court held that the patient was required to bring his claim within two years from the time the cause of the action accrued. The court also held that trial court's finding that the 1991 Act was constitutional was not erroneous where the rational basis for applying it to minors with medical malpractice claims was to control healthcare costs paid by the people of Arkansas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sebastian County Chancery Court (Arkansas) granted summary judgment to appellee city and against appellant residents in a case where the residents filed illegal exaction and three unlawful-transfer of municipal funds claims against the city. The residents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county approved an ordinance calling for a special election to levy a one percent sales and use tax. A local newspaper published the ordinance and stated the tax proceeds would be used for &quot;general, municipal, and county purposes.&quot; The city's board of directors adopted a resolution endorsing passage of the sales and use tax. It promised to spend the money in specified ways if passage occurred. The tax was approved. The residents argued the city violated Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 11 when it did not honor its board of director's spending commitments. The residents also alleged three transfers of funds from other city funds to the city's general fund, including one made in 1994, were unlawful. After the trial court ruled for the city, the state supreme court found, on the illegal exaction claim, that the enabling legislation under Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 11 was the ordinance, not the city's resolution; thus, the city could use the tax proceeds as the ordinance designated. It also found the 1994 alleged unlawful transfer claim was barred by a three-year statute of limitations, but the other two claims depended upon whether a surplus existed in the funds making the transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of summary judgment to the city on the illegal exaction claim was affirmed as was a claim against the city that in 1994 it unlawfully transferred funds from its water and sewer operation to its general fund. However, the grant of summary judgment to the city regarding 1996 transfer of funds from the water and sewer operating fund to the general fund, and from the sanitation operating fund to the general fund, was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not raise his challenge to the death penalty statute's constitutionality in the trial court or on direct appeal. The argument that the statute was unconstitutional because felony capital murder and premeditated and deliberated murder were identical to and overlapped with first-degree felony murder and first-degree murder had previously been rejected, and prior counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise it. The argument that the sentencing instructions and jury verdict forms were defective could not be considered as they were not abstracted.  Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-603 did not result in a mandatory death sentence, and counsel's failure to raise the issue was not ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant physically punished the child victim and his sibling for a year until he caused an injury from which the victim died. The evidence more than sufficiently supported defendant's capital murder conviction. Previous injuries defendant caused to both children were admissible to show intent and absence of mistake or accident, and its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. The victim's mother's statement that she participated in the fatal beating, after denying it, was excluded as it did not exculpate defendant and was untrustworthy. The requirement of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-101(a)(9) (1997) that knowingly causing the death of a person 14 or younger be done with extreme indifference to the value of human life to be capital murder was not unconstitutionally vague, as it was defined as acting with deliberate conduct culminating in a person's death. Defendant's requested jury instructions regarding the use of appropriate force in discipline had no rational basis and were properly rejected. An instruction on accomplice liability had no application. Defendant could not appeal the seating of a juror he did not challenge for cause.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to life imprisonment as a habitual offender under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-501(d)(1)(A) (1997). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant committed an armed robbery and sexually molested one of his victims in the robbery. One of the victims gave police detectives the license plate number of defendant's car. Detectives identified defendant and took him to a police station for questioning. When defendant was uncooperative, he was taken to a jail cell for 12 hours and then returned for questioning. The detectives said defendant then signed a waiver of rights and gave a confession. Defendant claimed he confessed involuntarily and under duress after he invoked his right to remain silent. On appeal, the supreme court found the confession was admissible, as there was no evidence to indicate that the police failed to scrupulously honor defendant's right to cut off questioning. Further, considering the totality of the circumstances, defendant's custodial statement was given voluntarily. Finally, the habitual offender statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment. At a show-cause hearing, defendant argued that a blanket denial of bail on appeal in certain classes of cases was unconstitutional. The prosecutor responded that Rule 6 did not allow for an appeal bond when the defendant had been convicted of first-degree murder. The trial court revoked defendant's bail. On appeal, defendant argued that Rule 6 amounted to a violation of the prohibition against excessive bail found in U.S. Const. amend. VIII, as well as in Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 9. The supreme court noted that there was a distinction between pretrial bonds and appeal bonds, declaring that a criminal defendant had an absolute right before conviction, except in capital cases, to a reasonable bail; however, a bond on appeal was not an absolute right. The supreme court held that neither the Arkansas Constitution nor the United States Constitution guaranteed a person convicted of a crime the right to bail pending appeal; therefore Rule 6's denial of bail to those convicted of certain crimes did not constitute an &quot;excessive bail&quot; in violation U.S. Const. amend.

The Pulaski County Chancery Court (Arkansas) ruled for appellee Director of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration (DFA), dismissing the complaint. Retailer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, retailer argued that a rational basis test was applicable; that DFA was violating the Soft Drink Tax Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-57-901 et seq. (Repl. 1997), and its own regulation by taxing cherry and vanilla syrups used to flavor drinks; that the Act's border city exemption violated equal protection; and that the trial court erred in determining that the Act did not treat persons differently and there were rational bases for the discrimination against retailers selling soft drinks made from syrup. The Arkansas Supreme Court held that the cherry/vanilla issue was not raised, and the border city issue not ruled on, below. The border city exemption benefitted rather than penalized retailers. Although that exemption benefitted individuals rather than products, one could not determine the nature of a tax by looking at an exemption provision. Thus the Act did not discriminate against individuals rather than products. Retailer failed to show that syrup-produced drink sellers paid more tax per gallon than powder-produced drink sellers. A previous standing ruling in retailer's favor had not produced a law of the case in retailer's favor in regard to the discrimination issue.</SPAN></P>

The property owner used that street for ingress and egress to and from her property. She had standing to challenge the city's ordinance, even though it was not an actual taking of her property, because she suffered a distinct injury not suffered by the general public by the taking of land through which she had a property right of ingress and egress. Because her land abutted this road, she had both a public right in the road enjoyed in common with all other citizens and certain private rights arising from ownership of property contiguous to the road. This easement in the road for the purpose of ingress and egress attached to her property, and she had a right of property in it as fully as in her lot. That right was not diminished if she had an alternative means of ingress and egress. When the city abandoned the road, that did not affect the property owner's private right to the use of the abandoned road for ingress and egress.</SPAN></P>

The firefighter and the estate sued the manufacturer and the supplier that furnished a hazardous chemical, on theories of negligence; willful, wanton, and reckless misconduct; misrepresentation; hidden danger; and strict liability due to ultra-hazardous materials. Appellants filed motions for summary judgment, arguing that the Fireman's Rule precluded recovery. The trial court, in denying the motion, made findings of fact and conclusions of law holding that appellants' willful and wanton misconduct barred their reliance on the Fireman's Rule. Appellants sought review; the intermediate appellate court dismissed the appeal. They appealed again. The instant court held that, while an order denying summary judgment was not itself appealable, the trial court went beyond this, and granted relief to the firefighter and estate by precluding appellants' use of Fireman's Rule as a defense. The trial court improperly decided the merits of a matter that was not yet ripe for decision. That portion of its order was therefore appealable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised 11 points of error relating mostly to claims of denial of due process and ineffective assistance of counsel. The appellate court held that many of the points had either been considered and rejected on direct appeal or not properly preserved for appeal. Even in those cases, however, the court noted that the claimed error had been determined adversely to defendant in other cases and defendant had presented no argument to convince the court to depart from those holdings. There was no error in refusal of the court hearing the postconviction petition to provide funds for defendant to hire an independent psychiatrist to assist in that hearing, nor was there error in the trial court's denial of a continuance of the Ark. R. Crim. P. 37 hearing to allow defendant's counsel to be certified to handle capital cases as co-counsel was already certified. It was not ineffective assistance of counsel to allow public defender in Rule 37 hearing to argue that prior public defenders had been ineffective. Failure of counsel to press matters already decided adverse to defendant in other cases was not ineffective assistance. Proportionality review was not required.</SPAN></P>

Appellee landowners asserted the inadequacy of this response and requested annexation by appellee city. The statute was previously found not to be an unconstitutional attempt to delegate legislative authority and service of the required notice on appellant's mayor, rather than its planning commission had been found adequate. Appellant was not a &quot;person&quot; entitled to raise a vagueness argument under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The trial court's finding, as a matter of law, that appellant did not make the statutorily required commitment to provide services was error as there was a genuine fact issue regarding the matter, as well as regarding the trial court's finding that appellee city was prepared to provide the requested services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under 1965 Ark.

Acts 708, groups affiliated under federal tax laws to file consolidated tax returns were allowed to file consolidated state tax returns. Appellant asserted that because appellee holding company did not own at least 95 percent of the stock of appellee bank, intercorporate dividends were taxable. The trial court found intercorporate distributions of dividends between appellees were excluded from taxation. The legislative intent of 1979 Ark. Acts 708 was to make available the choice for a corporation holding 80 percent of the voting power and total value of one or more other corporations to form an affiliated group with such corporations and for the affiliated group to file a single consolidated return on gross earnings from its business operations, thereby eliminating intercorporate dividends from taxation. 1965 Ark.

The trial court granted partial summary judgment against the estate of the fetus and summary judgment in favor of one physician on the basis of immunity. The jury returned a verdict for defendants. The Arkansas Court of Appeals certified the matter to the supreme court urging the reversal of precedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Deceased mother admitted for labor induction to a resident-in-training program at appellee hospital did not progress in labor. Appellee resident physicians were unable to rupture her membrane, as telephonically ordered by an appellee physician. After her death, delivery of the healthy baby was not attempted. Existing case law held a viable fetus was not a person for a wrongful death action, so partial summary judgment was granted against the fetus's estate. Given intervening contrary legislative intent, the case law was overruled, with the retroactive effective limited to this case. Summary judgment for appellee physician was reversed due to a fact issue concerning her immunity defense. The trial court abused its discretion by excluding an autopsy photograph, because it could be authenticated and was previously supplied to all parties. The exclusion of testimony of prior complaints about the training program did not prejudice appellant, nor did the exclusion of testimony of an unlicensed physician obtaining the deceased mother's informed consent. Appellees suffered no prejudice, in light of the verdict, from testimony of prior complaints about the program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant argued that the sentencing enhancement provision in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-501(d) (1997) was unconstitutional as applied to him. The appellate court found that appellant's argument was premised on the idea that &sect; 5-4-501(d), which required a mandatory life sentence in certain instances, and Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-103(a), which allowed the jury to impose a sentence within a statutory range, were at odds. Because the jury was required to fix punishment according to the entire criminal code, and the code required that a life sentence be imposed, the appellate court ruled that there was no conflict; further the fact that the trial court instead of the jury imposed the sentence was meaningless since there could not be a violation of defendant's Due Process and Equal Protection rights where the same sentence would have been handed down whether the court or the jury made the ruling. Also, because sentencing was controlled by statute, and, thus, by the legislature, the legislature's requirement of a life sentence for an habitual violent offender was mandatory and not within the trial court's or jury's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellee was the Arkansas Insurance Commissioner, who was appointed a receiver for appellee insurance company. Following a review of appellee insurance company's financial solvency, appellee commissioner found a $ 2,935,000 capital surplus deficiency. As a result, the parties entered into an agreement to cure the deficiency. The appellate court found that the circuit judge correctly found that a breach of the agreement occurred. In light of the language contained in the agreement between the parties, the appellate court concluded that the statutory requirements of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-68-104 did not control. The circuit court found that the appellants had consented to the entry of an order of receivership without prior notice. In addition, the immediate entry of a receivership order, with a permanent injunction, albeit entered ex parte, did not violate due process protections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged, in the Sebastian County Chancery Court (Arkansas), appellee city's disbursement of funds through a federally-funded housing rehabilitation program as violative of Ark. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 13. The trial court granted appellees' summary judgment motion, and appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city disbursed federal funds used for housing rehabilitation. Appellant challenged this as being an illegal exaction prohibited by Ark. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 13. The only standing requirements, where a plaintiff contended that public funds generated from tax dollars were being misapplied or illegally spent, were that the plaintiff be a citizen and have contributed tax money to the general treasury. A governmental subdivision use of funds not derived from state taxpayer monies was not subject to a challenge for unlawful disbursement, so appellant did not have standing to sue for illegal exaction for the disbursement of federal taxpayer funds paid into dedicated accounts and not commingled with appellee city's general fund. Appellant did, however, have standing to challenge appellee city's expenditure of general fund monies to pay salaries of city employees spending minimal time writing checks for the federal program. Urban and rural redevelopment programs were legitimate public purposes and public expenditures by appellee city in furtherance of those purposes were not unconstitutional under Ark. Const. art. XII, &sect; 5, so there was no illegal exaction under art. XVI, &sect; 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was affirmed because, while appellant did have standing to challenge appellee city's expenditure of funds to pay its employees' salaries who spent minimal time writing checks under the challenged federal program, this expenditure was for a legitimate public purpose and was, therefore, constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the course of an attempted liquor store robbery, appellant, aged 16, shot and killed a store employee. He admitted doing so, but claimed he accidentally fired the fatal shot. He was tried and convicted by a jury of capital felony murder and attempted aggravated robbery, and appealed. The appellate court affirmed. Appellant was not entitled to an instruction of &quot;felony manslaughter,&quot; as this was not a lesser-included offense of capital or first-degree felony murder. Appellant's claim that the capital felony murder charge was unconstitutionally vague had been rejected in an earlier decision. A hearsay statement by a witness to the crime was properly admitted as an excited utterance. Appellant's confession was properly deemed voluntary, despite appellant's age, his low-normal intelligence, and his alleged intimidation by an officer who slammed a file cabinet with his hand. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to tell the jury that it waived the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had not raised its constitutional arguments below, nor sufficiently developed its constitutional arguments to preserve them for review. Appellant had not pointed out which four requesting Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs) made claims, nor had appellant demonstrated that the administrator's determination was final. Appellant failed to abstract the forms submitted by the requesting companies, and as such, there was no way the court could review what the administrator considered. The appellate court affirmed on appellant's direct appeal, but reversed on cross-appeal. On cross-appeal, appellees designated as the Rural Telephone Companies (RTCs) argued appellee had erred in interpreting legislation as to which 12 months were the base test year for purposes of support calculations. Appellee's earlier decision stating which 12 months were the base test year was contrary to the commission's finding in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court upheld the constitutionality of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-52-104. Only if the transaction constituted a loan and if the fees charged constituted interest would the constitutional prohibition against usurious interest rates apply. It was clear courts must investigate the true nature of an alleged usurious transaction without regard to the form of the transaction; the legislature could not usurp this function. Judgment was reversed and remanded. The appellate court agreed with appellant's contention, holding that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-52-104(b) was an invalid attempt to evade the usury provisions of the Arkansas Constitution and, further, that such an attempt violated the constitutional mandate requiring separation of powers set forth Ark.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued the trial court erred: (1) in not allowing inquiry of the venire as to their religious denomination and number of times they attended religious services monthly, (2) in failing to find the Arkansas peremptory challenge statute,&nbsp;Ark.

The trial court's limitation on questions regarding religious beliefs was not an abuse of discretion. Because appellant did not demonstrate that the peremptory challenge statute had a prejudicial impact on either him or any stricken juror, it followed that appellant lacked standing to raise the issue on appeal; the court declined to reach the merits of the constitutional challenge.

Const. amend. 65, and that the fees charged to use the city's facilities were illegal exactions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city passed an ordinance authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds to fund parks, golf courses, a zoo, and other recreational facilities. The bonds were to be repaid solely from user fees from parks and recreational facilities. Appellant taxpayer sued to invalidate the ordinance, claiming that it violated Ark. Const. amend. 65, which prohibited pledging tax revenues to repay revenue bonds. She also argued that appellee, by increasing the user fees on the recreational facilities, imposed an illegal exaction. The trial court entered judgment for appellee; appellant sought review. The appellate court affirmed. The ordinance was constitutional on its face, as it pledged only user fees as repayment of the bonds. Appellant argued that appellee was indirectly using taxes to repay the bonds, since the funded faculties operated at a loss, and operating shortfalls would be paid with general revenues, i.e., taxes. But she filed to carry her burden to prove that this was the case, and the court would not speculate on future events.

The challenged ordinance was facially constitutional, and appellant failed to prove that appellee would circumvent the constitution and fund revenue bonds indirectly with general revenues.

Neither point was meritorious; the appellate court affirmed. Appellant was engaged in the business of hazardous waste disposal. Companies that generated hazardous waste materials in their operations paid appellant to take and dispose of the waste materials. The pivotal point was whether the packaged waste was sold. The appellate court concluded that a sale did not take place during the audit period. Thus, the purchased machinery and equipment was not involved in the production or manufacture of an article of commerce and did not qualify for the exemption. It was unnecessary to reach the issues of whether appellant's process equated to manufacturing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Benton County Circuit Court (Arkansas) adjudicating her a delinquent, arguing Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 6-17-106 (Repl. 1999) was unconstitutionally vague due to the broad range of conduct it conceivably proscribed and violated her U.S. Const. amend. I right to free speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant student was suspended for three days after she directed a curse word at her teacher. Thereafter, a prosecutor petitioned to adjudge her a delinquent pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 6-17-106 (1999 Repl.), providing any person who abused or insulted a public school teacher while she was performing assigned school responsibilities was guilty of a misdemeanor. Appellant was adjudged delinquent and appealed, arguing Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 6-17-106 (1999 Repl.) was unconstitutionally vague due to the broad range of conduct it conceivably proscribed and violated her U.S. Const. amend. I right to free speech. The court held any statute punishing or regulating the use of abusive language was required to be limited to fighting words, those words which by their utterance inflicted injury or incited an immediate breach of the peace. The court held the statute failed to proscribe merely fighting words; therefore it was overbroad. The court went on to reverse and dismiss the case, holding Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 6-17-106(a) (1999 Repl.) was also void for vagueness, as it did not define what precise conduct was proscribed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because the legislature passed an unconstitutional statute when it criminalized undefined, insulting, or abusive comments by any person to a teacher irrespective of the time, place, or manner of the speech. As the statute was not limited to only fighting words, it was overbroad and void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sponsored an initiative proposing the county be required to sell its county hospital. The petition indicated he would administer the sale in exchange for a commission from the gross receipts from the sale, and required the county to abate or suspend taxes levied on the property. Appellee sought a writ of mandamus, challenging the legal validity of appellant's initiative and seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the county clerk from certifying the adequacy of the petition's signatures. The trial court granted appellee's requested relief and appellant challenged the ruling, arguing the trial court erred in enjoining the certification of his initiative and by ruling the petition was legally invalid on its face. The court conducted an extensive review of statutory and constitutional mandates governing the sale of county property and concluded appellant's initiative usurped numerous statutory obligations of county officials regarding the sale of county property. The court went on to affirm, further finding the proposal unconstitutionally impaired the obligation of a lease contract executed by the county regarding the hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed, because appellant's initiative petition eliminated the functions of the county, the county judge, and other county officials regarding the sale of county property under the Arkansas Constitution.

Code Ann. &sect; 16-81-114, which expressly authorized a warrantless arrest for gas drive-offs. The supreme court disagreed with the trial court's finding that &sect; 16-81-114 was an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers. The supreme court did not have exclusive authority to set rules of procedure. The Arkansas General Assembly had on previous occasions extended the authority of police officers to make warrantless arrests, and the supreme court had responded by amending Ark. R. Crim. P. 4.1 to embody the legislation. Allowing warrantless arrests for misdemeanor gas drive-offs did not compromise the purpose and effectiveness of Rule 4.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the provisions of 1999 Ark. Acts 779 (Act), appellee landowners sought and obtained the deannexation of their property from appellant city and its annexation by appellee city. Appellants filed an action in the Benton County Circuit Court (Arkansas) seeking a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. Appellants sought review of the dismissal of their action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowners asked appellant city to provide their property with certain municipal services within a specified amount of time, and appellant declined to do so. 1999 Ark. Acts 779 (the Act) authorized these appellees to seek annexation of their land into another city which bordered their property, and they successfully did so. Appellant municipal corporation was not authorized to invoke the protections of U.S. Const. amend. XIV against the state. Municipalities were creatures of statute and, as such, the legislature had wide discretion to enact laws regarding the boundaries of a municipality. The Act contained procedural safeguards to prevent its arbitrary or discriminatory application. There was nothing in the Act to indicate its retroactive application, and one city's annexation of land located within a contiguous city was not a taking without due process. Appellee landowners properly provided notice of the proposed annexation by appellee city to appellant city's mayor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was affirmed because the legislation appellants challenged was a proper exercise of the legislature's power to regulate the borders of municipalities. The legislation contained appropriate procedural safeguards, and the process of deannexation and annexation it authorized was not a taking without due process.</SPAN></P>

After investigating, appellee concluded that in at least three instances, appellant had violated what was known as appellee's &quot;Regulation Q&quot;. That regulation prohibited direct contact with prospective patients by in-person or live telephone communication for the purpose of soliciting employment with a prospective patient. Appellant had hired a professional telemarketing firm which made calls to prospective patients after obtaining accident reports from the area where appellant practiced. That firm would then encourage the injured person to schedule an appointment with appellant. After a hearing, appellee fined appellant and placed him on probation. On appeal, the trial court affirmed. Appellant challenged the adverse rulings. The court reversed. The regulation violated the First Amendment because it was not narrowly tailored to prevent harms appellee sought to prevent, but instead, was an absolute prohibition of a chiropractor's commercial speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of disorderly conduct. The Arkansas Court of Appeals affirmed. Appellant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer approached appellant and asked him his name because he was pacing and acting nervous late in a high-crime neighborhood. Appellant responded with an expletive, and violently the officer thought, so he called for backup. One of the several responding officers was aware of appellant's past charge of assaulting an officer, and observed him yelling, cursing, and flailing his arms. While the officer tried to verify his claim that he was waiting for a taxi, appellant would alternately calm down and get agitated. The officer asked appellant to return from a nearby carport, instead he sprinted across the porch, and officers subdued him. From many charges, appellant was ultimately convicted of failure to submit to arrest and disorderly conduct, and he appealed the latter. The court affirmed. Appellant's initial language in conjunction with his demonstrative behavior and the officer's knowledge of the past assault charge constituted &quot;fighting words&quot; proscribed by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-71-207(a)(3) (1997) on disorderly conduct. However, even apart from his words, appellant's conduct was disorderly under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-71-207(a)(1), (2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Conviction was affirmed. Profane language directed toward police, combined with appellant's irrational, demonstrative behavior and officer knowledge that appellant had a prior charge of assaulting an officer, made appellant's language &quot;fighting words,&quot; and thus statutory disorderly conduct. Even apart from his words, appellant's tumultuous behavior was disorderly conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee racing commission's track stewards imposed sanctions against appellant horse owner after appellant's jockey impermissibly used an electrical device to win the Arkansas Derby. The track stewards investigated. Following a hearing, they suspended and fined the jockey, disqualified the winning horse, and redistributed the purse. After another hearing, appellee upheld the stewards' ruling and approved the sanctions. Appellant challenged appellee's decision. The trial court affirmed. Appellant's next appeal was certified by the appellate court. The court affirmed. Appellee's rules prohibited using an electrical device to increase a horse's speed. Even though the rule contained no express sanction following the rule, the stewards were empowered to punish violations of those rules in order to protect the public's interest in horse racing. Also, the public interest meant the rules did not require that appellee prove collusion between an owner and a jockey; thus, appellant's due process rights were not violated when sanctions were imposed on him without proof of fault.

Appellant challenged the conviction. Appellant's counsel filed an Anders brief and motion to be relieved as counsel stating there was no merit to the appeal. The court held the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The jury was presented with evidence that appellant, armed with a gun, parked his car away from his estranged wife's home at night. Appellant admitted he cut the phone lines to the home. Appellant shot the victim four times while her child was running to a neighbor's house to call the police. The court held the jury was free to disbelieve appellant's argument that the shooting was accidental.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wholesaler of cigarettes and other products challenged an order of the Chancery Court of Chicot County, Arkansas, Division Two, which denied its motion to intervene under Ark. R. Civ. P. 24(a) as untimely. The action involved application of the Arkansas Unfair Cigarette Sales Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-701 et seq. (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was a wholesaler of cigarettes and other products. Competing cigarette companies who had previously questioned a determination by appellee under the Arkansas Unfair Cigarette Sales Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-701 et seq. (1999) obtained a preliminary injunction against appellee state tobacco control board. The injunction prevented appellee from setting wholesale costs without establishing appropriate procedures. The preliminary injunction later became permanent. Appellant, who was affected by that action, was not a party to that action, and sought to intervene under Ark. R. Civ. P. 24(a) four years after the preliminary injunction was granted. The court affirmed the chancery court's denial of appellant's motion to intervene. The motion was not timely as required by Rule 24(a). Since the motion was not timely, the court did not have to consider whether the chancery court abused its discretion, or whether appellant had a sufficient interest to protect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed. Given the extraordinary delay before appellant filed its motion to intervene, four years, the court could not say that it was an abuse of discretion for the chancery court to deny the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor appealed order from the Faulkner County Chancery Court, Juvenile Division (Arkansas) convicting her of a misdemeanor count of shoplifting and imposing a suspended sentence and twelve months' probation, contending she was subjected to multiple punishments in violation of the double jeopardy clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the charge against her because she had been subjected to multiple punishments for the same offense, in violation of the double jeopardy clause. Appellant was arrested for shoplifting goods valued at approximately $ 64.98 from a retail store. Prior to appellant's juvenile-intake hearing, the store contacted appellant's father and demanded that he pay a $ 100 civil penalty, as authorized under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-122-102 (Supp. 1999), even though the goods stolen by appellant were returned to the store. The trial court ruled the statute was unconstitutional, and ordered the store to return the $ 100 paid by appellant's father. As a result, the law of the case was that the statute was unconstitutional, appellant could not be subjected to the civil penalty, and thus was not faced with multiple punishments. The court warned , however, that if future parties properly raised and addressed the issue of the statute's constitutionality, the court might consider the merits of such an argument.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. In light of the fact that appellant shoplifter was not subjected to the civil penalty after the trial court ordered the penalty was unconstitutional and required the store to refund it, her argument on appeal that she faced double jeopardy was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county officials sued appellee election commission members to invalidate a county initiative enacted in November of 1998 which limited the terms of elected officials for eight county offices to five, two-year terms. Appellants had each served six or more two-year terms in their respective county offices that were listed in the initiative. However, the appellants also wanted to have their names placed on the ballot for the next general election, in November of 2000. Appellants moved for summary judgment. The trial court denied appellants' motion and issued an order upholding the validity of the initiative. Appellants challenged that holding. The court reversed and remanded the case. It first held the appeal was not moot since ballot eligibility would be a future issue. The court then held that the initiative violated the Arkansas Constitution, which provided that no local legislation was to be enacted contrary to the Arkansas Constitution or Arkansas general law. Since the initiative was contrary to the requirements set forth in the Arkansas Constitution or state statutes for holding county office, the court held the initiative was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and case remanded because the county initiative violated the Arkansas Constitution which stated that no local legislation was to be enacted contrary to the Arkansas Constitution or Arkansas' general law, and the Arkansas Constitution and state statutes set forth the requirements for an individual to be elected to county office, making the initiative contrary to those sources of law.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 37, following his conviction, death sentence, and appeal on capital murder for killing a five-year-old girl during the course of raping her, to avoid arrest, manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital felony murder and sentenced to death for strangling and smothering the five-year-old daughter of his girlfriend, during the course of and in furtherance of raping her, instead of taking her to school, manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Following his conviction and appeal, he petitioned for postconviction relief pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 37, primarily claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The appellate court affirmed, finding appellant failed to show any prejudice from counsel's alleged failures, and failed to demonstrate he would have otherwise received a life sentence. His remaining claims were previously raised on direct appeal and rejected, and could not be reargued. His final argument was that it was error to assert in the penalty phase as an aggravating factor that the murder was committed for a purpose, avoiding arrest, as that was inconsistent with the &quot;manifesting extreme indifference&quot; language of the guilt phase. The court held the requirement of deliberate conduct was consistent with the jury's conclusion that the murder was motivated by the desire to avoid arrest.</SPAN></P>

He sought injunctive relief against an interim suspension imposed by respondent Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct pursuant to Ark. Prof. Conduct P. &sect;&sect; 7, 8.

As such, the freedom of association in U.S. Const. amend. I did not apply. The overbreadth doctrine was inapplicable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants claimed that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 8-6-606 violated the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution, that appellee was not entitled to sovereign immunity, and that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies was inapplicable. Appellants admit that they failed to submit solid-waste quarterly reporting forms to appellee and to pay the statutory fees. Following receipt of the notice of violation, appellants had 20 days within which to respond and failed to do so. Appellants responded by filing a counterclaim seeking removal to federal court only after appellee commenced the enforcement action. Because appellants failed to respond to appellee's allegations that they failed to pay fees assessed against solid-waste transporters and to raise the constitutional arguments at the administrative level, they were barred from pursuing those claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged an order of the Pulaski County Circuit Court, Third Division (Arkansas), which affirmed the decision of the Arkansas Professional Bail Bond Company and Professional Licensing Board (Board) revoking appellants' licenses. The matter was transferred from the Arkansas Court of Appeals to the instant court as involving the determination of the constitutionality of a statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The right of appellants to be licensed was not constitutionally or statutorily preserved, nor was such a right preserved by private agreement; thus, de novo review of appellee board's license revocation decision was not available.  Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-19-106 (Repl. 1995) created and empowered the professional licensing board to administer and enforce the licensing requirements for bail bond companies and bail bondsmen. Moreover, that section expressly granted the board the authority to establish reasonable rules and regulations necessary to carrying out its duty of regulating bond companies and bondsmen. Because decisions regarding the licensing of bond companies and their employees turned on executive wisdom, it was appropriate to limit the scope of review on appeal. The separation of powers doctrine precluded de novo review of such decisions. The court found that the board's decisions to revoke appellants' licenses and to impose an administrative fine were supported by substantial evidence and were not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed. Professional licensing board was better equipped than the court to determine and analyze the underlying legal issues affecting the agency, and this accounted for the limited scope of judicial review and the refusal of the court to substitute its judgment and discretion for that of board. Substantial evidence supported the board's decision. The egregious nature of appellants' offenses warranted the punishment of revocation.</SPAN></P>

XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a registered Arkansas voter, filed an action for a declaratory judgment and writ of mandamus, seeking to block certification of a constitutional amendment proposed by the legislature. Appellant contended that the popular name and ballot title of the amendment, which proposed to limit the increase in assessed value of real property after required statewide reappraisals, were unintelligible and materially incomplete, and that the amendment was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion. The court affirmed, holding that while appellant offered viable reasons why the title was misleading, such as its failure to relate that taxpayers in different counties would be treated differently, there was no reason to depart from the &quot;manifest fraud on the public&quot; standard in assessing the accuracy or omissions of a ballot title. This was the case even though voter initiatives were subject to an &quot;intelligible, honest, and impartial&quot; standard. Under the &quot;manifest fraud&quot; standard, the proposed title withstood appellant's challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original action, petitioner sought early review of a proposed constitutional amendment pursuant to Act 877 of 1999, codified as Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 7-9-501 et seq. (Repl. 2000). Petitioner charged that the popular name and ballot title were misleading, and that the proposed measure, if enacted, would have been invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent issued a declaration that the popular name and ballot title of the proposed constitutional amendment were fair and accurate and that the measure, if subsequently approved, would have been valid. Voters reading the popular name were told that the amendment to the procedures for raising taxes applied only to sales taxes; whereas, the ballot title referred to the amended procedures for increasing any taxes. By limiting the scope of the popular name to sales taxes only, the popular name contained language that was misleading. The popular name and ballot title for decreasing taxes stated that it applied only to sales taxes, but the proposed amendment applied to any taxes. Thus, by limiting the popular name and ballot title to sales taxes, the provisions were rendered misleading and insufficient. Because the popular name and ballot title were fundamentally misleading in that they failed to convey an intelligible idea of the scope and import of the proposed measure, the proposed amendment's popular name and ballot title were insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Ark. Const. amend. 7. Thus, respondent was enjoined from placing the proposed measure on the ballot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the secretary of state, was enjoined from placing the proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot because the popular name and ballot title were misleading in that they did not accurately state the scope and the import of the proposed constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioners, members of the media, requested a writ of mandamus directing respondent, a juvenile court judge, to revoke her gag order on the press. The matter arose out of a delinquency case brought by the State against a twelve-year-old child. Respondent ordered that (1) no information be released by the media except what was stated on the record at the hearings, (2) no names or pictures of the victim and the victim's family be disseminated in the media, (3) no names or pictures of the child or his family be disseminated in the media, and (4) no names or pictures of juveniles in the courthouse be broadcast or released by the media. The court agreed with petitioners that the gag order was too broad, and because of its breadth, constituted a prior restraint on the press. Because respondent's order was a plain, manifest, clear, and gross abuse of discretion, the court granted a writ of certiorari, rather than a writ of mandamus, and directed respondent to modify her gag order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One night appellant's wife ran to her friends residence and told them he cut her, choked her, and forced her to have sex. Two nights later, after he apologized, she left with appellant. The next day appellant told his wife's daughter that she would never find her. Appellant drove his wife's car around and told a friend he had cut someone and was going to wash off blood. Blood from a seat stain matched that of appellant's wife. Her body was found, having been stabbed repeatedly and buried near appellant's friend's home, having been killed a day or two after she was last seen. Appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to die. Appellant argued the evidence was insufficient, that the jury wrongly was not instructed about second degree murder, that his wife's statements were hearsay, and that victim-impact evidence was irrelevant. The court affirmed. The jury could infer the deliberation necessary for capital murder from the nature of the wounds alone, which showed a degree of intent beyond not caring whether his wife died. His wife's statements to her friends had been excited utterances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed. Repeated stab wounds and cuts on appellant's deceased wife was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that appellant had deliberated in killing her, not just that he was indifferent to her death, which was capital rather than second degree murder. Her excited utterances to her friends concerning appellant were exceptions to the hearsay rule, and victim-impact evidence was admissible for the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was denied postconviction bail after his conviction of rape.

Crim. 6(b)(3) was unconstitutional. Nothing in the Arkansas constitution or United States Constitution guaranteed a person convicted of a crime the right to bail pending appeal. Appellant was convicted in state court for violation of a state statute. He was seeking bail while his case was on appeal to a state appellate court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were taxpayers in the school district who resided in the county of the school. They filed a complaint against the school district and county officials alleging that collection of a school district tax constituted an illegal exaction because the school district stood to receive revenues exceeding by more than 10 percent of those received in the previous year. They sought a writ of mandamus to roll back the tax rate. Appellees amended their complaint to request that the defined class of taxpayers be restricted to only those taxpayers of the school district who resided in the county. Appellants were members of the board of a certain school district and a taxpayer in the school district but resident of another county. Appellants contended that the class should have included all taxpayers residing in the school district. The trial court ruled in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court reversed based on the plain meaning of Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 14. The court remanded the case to allow the trial court include other county residents of the school district as members of the class arising as a matter of law from the illegal-exaction suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting appellants were contractually obligated to provide them lifetime health insurance as a benefit of their employment, and arguing the deprivation of the benefit was an unconstitutional deprivation of a property right. The trial court refused to dismiss the complaint in its entirety after finding appellees had a vested property right in the benefits and holding their claim for unconstitutional deprivation of such right fell within an exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity in Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 20. Appellants sought review. The court held appellees' allegations did not sufficiently plead a deprivation of a vested property right. The retirement benefits at issue were not statutorily created, but were gratuitous allowances to which appellees did not contribute and in which appellees did not have a property right. Appellees failed to produce facts to the contrary and thus did not plead facts sufficient to state a claim based on unconstitutional impairment of a vested property right.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of eight criminal counts related to three sexual encounters involving the use of the drug Rohypnol with two women. Defendant appealed. The appellate court certified the case to the state supreme court (the court) because the constitutionality of the Arkansas Rape Shield Statute (ARSS), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-42-101, was at issue. Regarding the counts of rape and introduction of a controlled substance, the evidence was sufficient because it was not such that the jury was reduced to mere speculation and conjecture. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of prior uncharged acts under Ark. R. Evid. 404(b) (the evidence was highly relevant to prove defendant's modus operandi) or expert testimony under Ark. R. Evid. 703 (plaintiff's expert's knowledge of Rohypnol was beyond ordinary knowledge). Finally, the court had previously determined that the ARSS was constitutional. Consequently, defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An amendment to the Arkansas Constitution, the Gaming Amendment, was proposed that would authorize gambling in the state. Money from gaming was to go to a trust fund to provide college grants for graduates of accredited high schools. Petitioner challenged the legal sufficiency of the initiative petition. After respondent issued a declaration upholding the validity of the proposed amendment, petitioner brought a declaratory judgment action before the court. The court denied his petition. The court held that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 7-9-501 to -506 (2000), which gave taxpayers the right to challenge proposed initiatives, was constitutional as it did not conflict with Ark. Const. amend. VII, which allowed laws to be enacted to facilitate the initiative process. The Gaming Amendment's popular name and ballot title were sufficient because the term &quot;qualified high school graduate,&quot; referring to who would receive the gambling proceeds, told the voter that certain qualifications had to be met, and put the voter on notice that there might be one or more factors for determining eligibility for receipt of the proceeds.</SPAN></P>

Other evidence also pointed to appellant, including a state trooper's eyewitness encounter with appellant at the crime scene on the night of the crimes and a time card discounting appellant's explanation for being at the scene. Limiting cross-examination of medical examiner concerning an allegation of supervisor misconduct was not error where it did not relate to processing of the DNA sample.

The business prevailed in both the municipal court and in a trial de novo before the circuit court. The company appealed.

The business argued that the issue was not preserved for review as the company failed to raise the objection below. The court of appeals held that because the record on appeal did not reflect that an election was held, there could be no objection to the election procedure, and reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. The supreme court disagreed because even if it accepted the company's correspondence to the judge as a valid objection, notwithstanding that there was no ruling on the issue, the objection raised to the trial court did not point out the reasons it believed the procedure was defective. The letter only contended that the selection of the special judge did not meet the statutory requirements of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 6-10-115.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of an extremely violent and brutal murder. On appeal he argued there was insufficient evidence that his actions in the killing were premeditated, as he had been highly intoxicated and argued the parties were engaging in rough sex and things got out of hand. The court found ample circumstantial evidence of premeditation, including the victims many injuries and the fact that her strangulation had taken from one to five minutes to complete. Defendant also argued that the capital murder statute was void for vagueness because of the overlapping of the &quot;premeditated and deliberated&quot; mens rea in the capital murder statute and the &quot;purposeful&quot; mens rea in the first-degree murder statute. The prosecution could legitimately choose between the statutes in its discretion. In any event, defendant had not been prejudiced by the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed a sixth amended complaint, alleging that 1997 Ark. Acts 1307 and 1997 Ark.

On appeal, the appellant raised issues relating to the final order of the chancery court, which dismissed the complaint, and the petition to show cause for contempt. Appellant also appealed from the denial of attorney's fees. The appellate court held that the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint and show-cause petition for mootness and for failure to state a claim. Without a compliance trial on the constitutionality of state initiatives since 1994, there was no basis for the chancery court's finding of mootness and failure to state a claim. Also, the trial court erred by denying attorney's fees, since appellee waived its sovereign-immunity defense to payment of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the mother of two children who challenged the termination of her parental rights pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-341 (Supp. 1997). The court held that the evidence supported the termination due to evidence of sexual abuse and appellant's failure to make any consistent improvements in her visitation with the children, her employment, or her housing. Appellant repeatedly failed to comply with order designed to remedy the problems that warranted removal in the first place, which was the exact type of situation the statute was designed to address. It was not error to deny placement of the children with appellant's mother since appellant made no formal motions and the evidence indicated the mother didn't appear to want the responsibility. Requiring appellant's counsel to represent the indigent appellant pro bono would have amounted to an unconstitutional taking under U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 9-12-312(a)(2)(D), relating to cohabitation, violated due process because her argument was based on an incorrect interpretation of the plain language of the statute; [2]-Section 9-12-312(a)(2)(D) did not violate equal protection when it was analyzed under the rational basis test; the reasonable governmental purpose was to settle the economic imbalance between the parties by assessing whether the facts of the case showed a need for alimony; [3]-The statute did not violate the fundamental right to privacy under the strict scrutiny test because a compelling state interest was achieved in the least restrictive means possible; [4]-There was no abuse of discretion as the circuit court would not have awarded alimony to the wife under either the previous or current versions of the statute.</SPAN></P>

P. 4(d)(7); [2]-While Rule 4(d)(1) governed service on several aldermen in their individual capacities, it did not apply to service upon a municipal corporation; [3]-Although the underlying judgment remained in full force and effect against the parties named in the judgment, the trial court found that the city was not a party to the underlying action or subject to garnishment of its bank accounts; [4]-An argument that the city failed to file a verified petition was waived because it was not made below.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Benton County Circuit Court (Arkansas) dismissed the negligence suit of appellant injured employee against appellee employer. The trial court held that the action was barred by the exclusivity provisions of the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Act (Act), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-105(a) (2002). The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee fell off a metal roof sustaining serious injury to his right ankle, which required surgery. Before the employee was released from the hospital, a drug-screen test proved positive for methamphetamine. Based upon the positive drug screen, the Workers' Compensation Commission held that the claim was barred pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-102(4)(B)(iv)(a)-(d) (2009) because a compensable injury did not include an injury for an accident caused by illegal drug use. The employee alleged that the trial court erred in holding that his action was barred because he did not elect to bring a Workers' Compensation claim, but was compelled to do so. The employee alleged that he had no remedy because his injury was outside the Act's coverage and that the Commission lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over cases involving drug and alcohol use. The court held that the Commission retained jurisdiction, but that the burden of proof shifted to the employee to rebut the presumption that the injury was occasioned by the illegal drug use and that the employee failed to overcome the presumption invoked by the employer's intoxication defense.</SPAN></P>

After the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) granted the motion, appellee filed a counterclaim seeking to set aside a tax deed from the Arkansas Commissioner of State Lands to appellant's predecessor in title.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner's published notice of sale of appellee's land listed an incorrect parcel number. Appellant's predecessor bought the land and conveyed it to appellant, which filed a complaint to quiet title. After its attempts to serve appellee failed, appellant published a warning order under Ark. R. Civ. P. 4(f). A decree quieting title in favor of appellant was entered by default. The appellate court held that appellant failed to obtain valid service via warning order, as it did not mail a copy of the warning order to appellee and did not file an affidavit stating that 30 had elapsed since the order was published. Appellant could not avail itself of the long-arm statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code. Ann. &sect; 16-58-120 (2005), as that statute did not apply to in rem proceedings like quiet title actions. As appellant did not properly serve appellee, the decree quieting title was void and could have been set aside under Ark. R. Civ. P.  55(c). As the failure to include the correct parcel number in the notice of sale, as required by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-37-201(b), rendered the tax sale of the land to appellant's predecessor void, appellee was entitled to have the deed to the predecessor set aside.</SPAN></P>

The decedent's surviving spouse obtained her 1/5 undivided interest in the disputed property by devise from the decedent.

The final order directed the commissioner to execute a deed, approve attorney fees, and disburse funds. Appellant sought review, but the appellate court affirmed. The partition statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 18-60-419(a)(1) (2003), specifically directed the circuit court to award a reasonable attorney fee, to be taxed as costs, to the attorney who brought the partition suit. The motion for the fees was filed prior to the entry of the final, appealable order consistent with the relevant statutes and rules. Appellant also challenged the circuit court's authority to determine interest beyond the evidence presented. However, he failed to present a record with sufficient information regarding an equitable life estate in the rental house to demonstrate error on the part of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in declining to apply &sect; 26-26-1112 retroactively because the tax forfeiture at issue occurred long before &sect; 26-26-1112 was enacted and the Arkansas Supreme Court had previously declined to give &sect; 26-26-1112 retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the employer as a substitute teacher. The employer was a private company that provided school districts with substitute teachers. The employer argued that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-10-509 (Supp. 2009), which denied unemployment benefits to employees of educational institutions under certain circumstances, was applicable because the employee had provided instructional services for an education institution, and the employee provided services in one academic year and contracted to provide services in the following year. The plain language of the statute required that the employee be employed by an educational institution and the employer was not an educational institution within the meaning of the statute; it was a private company. In addition, the employee had not performed services in an instructional capacity for an educational institution in an academic term and did not have a reasonable assurance of performing such services for an educational institution in the next academic term. Therefore, the employee was entitled to unemployment benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were directed to travel from Arkansas to a meeting in Texas. The employer did not direct or control the means of travel. One of the employees was a licensed pilot. He regularly used his aircraft for business trips, and the company reimbursed him. The employees decided to fly in his plane to Texas. Appellant was killed. His estate sought damages arising from the pilot's failure to use reasonable care and skill in maintaining and operating the aircraft. The Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission erred by finding that the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act applied under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-105(a). The Court of Appeals of Arkansas acknowledged that each employee was within the scope of his employment during the trip. However, the employer did not control or direct the pilot in maintaining and operating the aircraft with reasonable care and skill; and the specific means of travel did not advance the employer's interest. Therefore, the exclusive remedy provision did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Drew County Circuit Court, Arkansas, convicted defendant of failing to register as a sex offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Arkansas's sex-offender registration requirement did not apply to him, that his conviction for failure to register as a sex offender was an unconstitutional ex post facto application of the law, and that the trial court's ruling on a Batson challenge was against the preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court found that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-12-906(A)(2)(A)-(B)(i) (Supp. 2007) clearly required defendant to register as sex offender. Defendant's conviction in the state of Washington required that he register as a sex offender; therefore, under &sect; 12-12-906(B)(i), he was also required to register as a sex offender in Arkansas. Defendant conceded that the State's reason for striking the African-American jurors was race neutral. The trial court gave defendant two opportunities to add anything further to his Batson challenge. There was no attempt by defense counsel to add anything further, even after being asked by the trial court on two occasions. If the party opposing the strike did not present more evidence, no additional inquiry was required.</SPAN></P>

The employer appealed. The employee cross-appealed the limitation on benefits for his mental injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a 58-year-old truck driver, suffered physical and mental injuries when he was forced off the road by another semi that turned into his vehicle. The employer argued on appeal the 32 percent upper extremity impairment rating (from which the finding of 19 percent whole-body impairment was derived) was excessive because a medical witness stated that it was excessive. The court held that this was an issue of credibility, which provided no basis for reversal. The Commission was free to believe the testimony of one physician rather than that of another. The court held that the 60 percent wage-loss disability was properly based on the Commission's consideration of the employee's anatomical impairment resulting from his shoulder injury; the fact that the employee was terminated although he was not issued a citation; the employee's age and the likelihood that he would be unable to return to his life's work; and his admitted psychological injury. The court rejected the employee's Equal Protection challenge to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-113(b)(1) (Repl. 2002), which limited compensation for mental injuries, because it had a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2001, plaintiff and the owner were involved in a traffic accident. In 2004, plaintiff brought a negligence action against defendants. The owner died in January 2005. In 2007, the company filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion on the basis that plaintiff had not revived the action within one year of the owner's death as required by Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-62-107, 16-62-108, and 16-62-109. The trial court denied plaintiff's motion to declare &sect;&sect; 16-62-107 and 16-62-108&nbsp;unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that Ark. R. Civ. P. 25 did not supersede the revivor statutes so that the one-year periods found in &sect;&sect; 16-62-107 and 16-62-108 did not apply. The trial court did not err in applying the one-year periods found in &sect;&sect; 16-62-107 and 16-62-108. Further, the time limits found in &sect;&sect; 16-62-107 and 16-62-108 did not infringe upon a party's right to access the courts because, by definition, the revivor statutes only applied in cases where a party died after a lawsuit was commenced.

The mother's mental illness and instability prevented her from parenting or supervising her children, and the father expressed doubt about his own capabilities, had an unstable work history, and threatened a case worker with violence. The proof further revealed that the parents lost their ability to function as parents in a household setting. During the case, they regained custody of their two older sons but were unable to control them. As a result, the children were sent to a state facility and were to remain there until they graduated. The court found it telling that, at the termination hearing, the parents did not ask that their youngest child be returned to their personal care but requested that he be sent to the same state facility. Because the child had spent well over four years in foster care and because the parents were unable to care for him, termination of their parental rights under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-341(b)(3)(B)(vii)(a) (2008) was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured filed suit against the insurer seeking underinsured motor-vehicle coverage. She was struck by another automobile who had a policy with the insurer and the insured also had a policy of liability with the insurer in force. After a jury rendered a $ 135,000 verdict in her favor, the circuit court entered an order awarding the insured statutory penalty and attorney's fees. The insurer appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in awarding the penalty and fees because the amount the insured recovered at trial was not within 20 percent of the amount she demanded or sought in her suit as required by Arkansas statute. The appellate court affirmed however, stating that the document filed by the insured with the reduced demand activated the application of the Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-79-208. Moreover, the insured did not make any formal and specific monetary demand at trial. The amended demand was a document, filed with the court, that clearly stated that the insured was reducing her demand. Further, the insured never made a demand or sued for $ 250,000 at trial. The parties stipulated to the limits of the policy, which were $ 250,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father alleged that the mother had interfered with his visitation with their child. The mother contended that her due process rights were violated because she was not given ten days to respond, pursuant to Ark. R. Civ. P. 6. The contempt statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-10-108 (Supp. 2007) provided only that a charged party be given a reasonable time to make a defense. The court held that the mother was given adequate notice that she stood accused of ongoing violations of the visitation order, as demonstrated by affidavits allowed by Ark. R. Civ. P. 43(c). However, the permanent restraining order, which authorized law-enforcement officers to arrest and incarcerate the mother for actions far beyond the statutory offense of interference with visitation, under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-26-501 (Supp. 2007), was an impermissible delegation of the circuit court's judicial power to enforce its orders by finding the mother in contempt, under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-10-108 (Supp. 2007).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the mother's petition for a rehearing and issued a substituted opinion that affirmed the circuit court's finding of contempt but reversed the permanent restraining order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had online chats with a person who claimed to be a thirteen year old girl, but who was actually a police detective. On appeal, the court held that the State did not fail to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant believed the victim was only thirteen years old as the detective told him that she was only thirteen years old in their correspondence and defendant noted the age difference as well as the fact that he would get into trouble if she told anyone about their chats. There was also sufficient evidence that defendant knowingly arranged a meeting with the girl including their correspondence that they would meet at a park, that the girl should wear a skirt, and discussing sexually explicit acts. In addition, the court did not agree with defendant's argument that &sect; 5-27-603 was overbroad and unconstitutional on its face and as it applied to defendant and that it criminalized a substantial amount of lawful speech with no compelling State interest in doing so because the case involved actions rather than ideas. Finally, defendant failed to properly preserve his claim that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Washington County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which convicted him of two counts of delivery of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-401(a)(1)(A)(i) (2005), sentenced him to two consecutive 25 year terms, and imposed a fine upon him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions, that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to give a jury instruction on probation, and that his sentences violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII and Ark. Const. art. II, &sect; 9. The court found that there was substantial evidence to support the jury's finding that defendant twice delivered methamphetamine to a confidential informant, including the informant's identification of defendant, and the identification by three police officers. In addition, the court held that the trial court exercised its discretion and that there was no abuse of that discretion in denying defendant an instruction on probation. Furthermore, it was unlikely that the jury would have recommended probation because it recommended consecutive 25 year terms, even though the minimum term was 10 years. Finally, because the sentence fixed by the trial court was within legislative limits, the court was not free to reduce it because the punishment did not result from passion or prejudice, was not a clear abuse of the jury's discretion, and was not grossly disproportionate so as to shock the moral sense of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant alleged to be a daughter born out of wedlock to the decedent, who died on August 17, 2005. The estate argued that the claims asserted by the claimant were barred by her failure to file a claim within 180 days of the decedent's death, as required by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-9-209(d) (2004). The claimant asserted that despite the time-bar in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-9-209(d), she should be permitted to assert her claim because her siblings induced her into believing that she would be treated as an heir during the relevant 180-day period. The appellate court ruled that the estate was not estopped from asserting that the claim was time-barred. Under caselaw, even if the decedent or siblings acknowledged an out-of-wedlock child's lineage, the estate was not thereafter estopped from relying on Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-9-209(d) and the out-of-wedlock child must nonetheless file a claim within 180 days of the decedent's death and must prove paternity by one of the methods indicated in the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of internet stalking of a child. He was sentenced to eight years in prison, fined, and required to register as a sex offender. On appeal, the court held that substantial evidence supported defendant's conviction. Defendant admitted to the police officers that he had chatted with a girl on the internet. The testimony showed that the &quot;girl,&quot; who was really a police officer, informed defendant very early on that she was only 13 years old. Defendant, on the other hand, indicated that he was older and that he would go to jail if he met her. The conversation became sexual in nature from that point forward. After establishing that they would meet, defendant indicated that three condoms would suffice and indicated that they would decide after they met if she could &quot;handle what he had.&quot; Defendant arrived at the designated meeting place at the designated time. Further, the trial court did not err in admitting the testimony of a digital evidence analyst with the State of Arkansas Crime Laboratory as expert testimony under Ark. R. Evid. 702. The analyst's testimony was based on his own experience and observation. The testimony was helpful to the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the mother chronically and unrelentingly refused to comply with a visitation order. It issued a permanent restraining order authorizing police officers to pick up the parties' child and deliver her to the father for visitation. It found the mother in contempt of court. On appeal, the court found that because the mother was aware of the contempt hearing, but did not appear, the trial court was within its discretion in hearing the matter on affidavits pursuant to Ark. R. Civ. P. 43(c). The trial court did not violate the mother's due process rights by taking notice of the instances of contempt that occurred after a show-cause order issued, but which nevertheless constituted part of the ongoing contempt alleged in the show-cause order. The court found no merit in the mother's argument that the trial court's order ran afoul of the separation-of-powers doctrine. The trial court directed officers to assist in the implementation of its order by transporting the child; as such, they were officers of the court for that purpose and were authorized to make arrests for violation thereof under Ark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a married couple, petitioned the court to change the surname of their minor child and to terminate the visitation rights of appellee, the wife's ex-husband. The Independence County Circuit Court (Arkansas) denied the name-change petition and found that appellants' marriage was not a material change of circumstances warranting the termination of appellee's visitation rights. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband impregnated appellant wife while she was married to appellee. The divorce decree found that appellee stood in loco parentis to the child and ordered that appellee have visitation with appellants' child and required him to pay child support and provide medical insurance for the child. The trial court determined that insufficient evidence was presented to support the name change. The appellate court disagreed. Although the length of time the child had borne the name weighed in favor of keeping it, changing the name would help preserve his relationship with his biological parents and siblings and prevent difficulties such as harassment and embarrassment because his name was different from his parents and siblings. Appellants waived their due process argument that they had a fundamental right to determine who had visitation with their biological child by consenting to entry of the divorce decree that provided that appellee stood in loco parentis to the child. The district court correctly found that appellants' marriage was not a material change in circumstances that justified modifying visitation; also, it would not have been in the child's best interests to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part, with instructions. The court affirmed the decision to deny modification of visitation rights. The court reversed the decision to deny the name-change petition.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 5-12-102(a) (2006), misdemeanor theft of property, and second degree battery under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-13-202 (Supp. 2007). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised various issues on appeal, but the court affirmed. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's robbery conviction and the evidence established that defendant employed physical force immediately after the theft. The theft, flight, struggle, and apprehension were accomplished in a matter of minutes without any significant intervening event. Given that the victim suffered a bite on his hand, a fractured nose, a baseball-size hematoma on his forehead, and bruises, plus he needed stitches across his nose and a series of hepatitis shots and he had a pink area and lacked full sensation on one side of his forehead, the jury could have found that the victim suffered a serious physical injury for purposes of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-102(14), (21), and thus the court affirmed defendant's second degree battery conviction. Because defendant did not make a contemporaneous objection at trial to in-court identifications of him, his challenge to the pretrial lineup was not preserved, plus his challenge to the in-court identifications was abandoned because the only basis of the challenge was the alleged taint of the pretrial identification process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant used a check and a driver's license with someone else's name to make a purchase at a retail store. After an off-duty police officer working at the store was informed of the occurrence, he pulled defendant over and asked her to return to the store. The vehicle was searched, and defendant was later convicted. This appeal followed. In affirming, the appellate court determined that defendant did not preserve her challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence because she did not make a motion at the close of all of the evidence and before closing arguments. Next, a motion to suppress evidence was properly denied. The officer was allowed to stop defendant under Ark. R. Crim. P. 3.1 (2006) based on the information given by the store employee about the transaction. There was no confidential informant here, so the officer was not required to ascertain the reliability of the employee before conducting an investigation of a possible forgery, in violation of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-37-201 (2006). Moreover, the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant under Ark. R. Crim. P. 4.1(a)(i); therefore, a search incident to arrest was proper under Ark. R. Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his deposition, the patient's expert witness stated that, had there not been a third bleeding site at the time of the second surgery to stop post-operative, intra-abdominal bleeding, he would have had no criticisms of either of the doctors involved in that surgery. The expert also said that he had no specific criticisms of the second doctor and did not feel that he had deviated below any standard of care with which the expert was familiar. The expert's criticism of the first doctor was that he did not adequately explore the bleeding in the second surgery and had deviated below the standard of care; that testimony was based upon the experts's opinion that there was a third bleeding site that was not identified. However, the expert admitted that he did not know whether there had been a third bleeding site at the time of the second surgery and that it would require speculation on his part to say so. Therefore, the expert's opinion was insufficient to satisfy the patient's burden of proof in the medical-malpractice action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant vehicle dealer challenged a decision from the Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which entered judgment in favor of appellee purchaser on claims of fraud and deceptive trade practices.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser noticed that the sticker price and the invoice price of a truck were different, but he was led to believe that he was paying the sticker price for a truck. The purchaser was also told that he was required to purchase an extended warranty. Later, he filed an action against the dealer. He was awarded compensatory damages and punitive damages, and this appeal followed. On review, the appellate court determined that substantial evidence supported the finding of a violation of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-88-107(a)(10) (Supp. 2005) because the dealer knowingly misrepresented the price of the vehicle and the necessity for a warranty. Next, there was no abuse of discretion by admitting the testimony of two experts under Ark. R. Evid. 702 (2007) since they were not required to have first-hand knowledge of the facts. However, a reduction in the $75,000 punitive damages award was necessary since it offended the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution when the appellate court considered the reprehensibility of the dealer's conduct, the ratio between compensatory and punitive damages, the available penalties for similar conduct, and prior awards in similar cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">If the purchaser agreed to accept a remitted award, then the judgment was affirmed as modified. Otherwise, the judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Visitation with the grandmother became sporadic after a divorce and a relocation to Arkansas. Due to an argument between the parties, the child stopped visiting the grandmother. The father filed a petition for a restraining order when the grandmother called the child's school to request a picture of him. The grandmother filed a petition to establish her visitation rights. The restraining order was denied, and visitation rights were granted. The father then sought review. In reversing, the appellate court held the father's constitutional argument was waived. Next, the grandmother failed to rebut the presumption set forth in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-13-103(c)-(e) (Supp. 2005). The grandmother established that she had a significant and viable relationship with the child for twelve consecutive months. The appellate court rejected the father's assertion that this had to be close in time to the petition for visitation. However, visitation was not in the child's best interest. The grandmother no longer had a relationship with the child, who wanted no contact with her. There was no evidence of likely harm to the child based on the father's decision to allow periodic contact at his discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to forgery and theft of property and was placed on probation. Appellee State filed a petition to revoke based on allegations that appellant committed third-degree sexual assault. The Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) convicted appellant for sexual assault. The State amended the original petition to revoke, and appellant's probation was revoked. Appellant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his revocation because (1) he was not brought to a hearing within 60 days of his arrest as required by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-310(b)(2) (2006), (2) the petition to revoke was not filed until after his probationary period expired, and (3) the felony statutes he was found to have violated so as to justify revoking his probation were unconstitutional. The appellate court determined that appellant expressly waived the 60-day requirement according to a docket entry and subsequently moved on several occasions to reset the revocation hearing to a later date. Appellant's argument regarding the petition to revoke was rejected because (1) the petition to revoke was not a new petition but instead was simply an amendment to the original, timely petition that merely added an additional alleged violation, and (2) appellant failed to show prejudice arising from the amended petition. Appellant's constitutional arguments previously were rejected in his appeal from his convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Jackson County Circuit Court, Arkansas, convicted defendant on drug charges and sentenced him to twenty years in the Department of Correction on the possession of the cocaine conviction and ten years on the possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to use to run consecutively. The trial court then added an additional two years to his sentence under the enhanced penalties provision of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-411 ( 2006). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-411 was void for vagueness and unconstitutional because it merely provided that an individual may be subject to an enhanced penalty but failed to provide the procedure as to how the enhanced penalty shall be imposed, such as whether the jury or trial judge should impose the penalty, and then ultimately failed to provide for any terms to the length of the sentence. The appellate court found that &sect; 5-64-411 provided for enhanced penalties of offenses committed under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-401(a) within 1000 feet of certain protected facilities. One of defendant's convictions was under &sect; 5-64-401(a) for possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) with intent to deliver. This offense was committed approximately 741 feet from a church, and a church was a protected facility under &sect; 5-64-411(a)(7). Defendant's conduct falls clearly within the prohibition of the statute. He could not complain that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. The statute unequivocally enhanced the sentence when the offense was committed within 1000 feet of a church.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee suffered compensable injuries while working for the employer.

The Fund asserted that it was not liable for benefits thereafter pursuant to &sect; 11-9-522(f)(1). The employee contended that the statute was unconstitutional. The Commission upheld an ALJ's decision that the employee failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that &sect; 11-9-522(f) was unconstitutional. The Commission held that the Fund was liable for permanent total disability benefits until the employee reached the age of 65. On appeal, the court agreed with the employee that the statute was an unconstitutional violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and Ark.

The Commission also held that the employee failed to demonstrate that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-522(f)(1) (2002) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in a work-related accident that caused him to lose his left leg in an above-the-knee amputation. He was 61 years old at the time. The Commission found that the employer had not controverted the employee's entitlement to PTD benefits. The Commission further found that the employee had not demonstrated that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-522(f)(1) (2002), which included a 260-week limitation on permanent total disability benefits for persons injured after age 60, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 11-9-522(f)(1) created a ceasing point for PTD benefits so that older workers who were eligible for social security or retirement benefits were foreclosed from receiving PTD for a legitimate work-related injury. There was no rational basis for such a distinction. The stated goal of avoiding retirement-benefit duplication had been squarely rejected by the Arkansas Supreme Court. The court held that &sect; 11-9-522(f) was unconstitutional. Further, the Commission had substantial evidence before it to conclude that the employer had not controverted the employee's status for purposes of awarding an attorney fee under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-715.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the Commission on the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 11-9-522(f). The court affirmed the judgment of the Commission on the controversion issue.</SPAN></P>

The ADHS filed a motion to supplement the record and to dismiss the appeal as moot because the mother had consented to the termination of her parental rights. The court found that because the mother did not appeal from the order terminating her parental rights, any decision that it would make regarding the timeliness of the probable cause hearing would have no legal effect on the existing controversy. A reversal of the trial court's order terminating reunification services would not change the findings of fact regarding the termination of parental rights decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The person answering the door at the residence allegedly allowed the officers to enter while she obtained her identification. The trial court specifically found that the officers' entry into the residence was by spontaneous invitation and not in response to a request for consent so that the provisions of State v. Brown did not apply. On review, the court reversed. The court found that a &quot;spontaneous invitation&quot; did not take the case out of the purview of Brown. A search of the residence, even one based upon consent, was not valid under Brown and Ark. R. Crim. P. 11.1(c) unless the person giving consent was advised of the right to refuse. The officers acknowledged that they did not advise that individual of her right to refuse consent. The officers stated that they entered the residence to determine if the persons on whom they wanted to serve arrest warrants were actually at the residence. That action met the definition of a search under Ark. R. Crim. P. 10.1, and the only &quot;sufficient consent&quot; was consent preceded by advice of the right to refuse, which was not done here.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Lonoke County Circuit Court (Arkansas) that convicted him of terroristic threatening in the first degree under Ark.

Code Ann. &sect; 5-13-207(a) (2002), and sentenced him to 6 years in prison and a fine on the threatening conviction, and 30 days in jail and a fine on the assault conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the terroristic threatening conviction, and claimed that his speedy trial rights were violated, and that the convictions on both charges were inconsistent. The court held that sufficient evidence supported defendant's threatening conviction because even though there was varied testimony on what actually occurred during the altercation with his wife and her family, the jury was free to believe the testimony that defendant pointed a gun at his brother-in-law's head, threatened to send him to meet Jesus, and threatened to kill his entire family. By defendant's own admission, he intended to frighten the victims so as to deter them from taking his property. The court rejected defendant's speedy trial violation claim because the delays were attributable to defendant. The court also held that the trial court did not err in accepting the jury verdicts because they were not inconsistent because the jury did not need to also find defendant guilty of aggravated assault against his brother-in-law. The court concluded that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a mistrial based upon hearsay testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with capital murder, aggravated robbery, and residential burglary following a felony information filed by the State. The State alleged that on August 5, 2004, he robbed, shot, and killed an eighty-four-year-old woman in her home. Because defendant was sixteen years old when the alleged offenses took place, he moved to transfer the case to the juvenile division of the lower court. His motion to transfer the case to juvenile court was filed on June 30, 2005. On July 28, 2005, he filed a separate motion asking the trial court to declare the juvenile-transfer statute unconstitutional. On August 30, 2005, the trial court denied defendant's motion for transfer. On August 31, 2005, the court entered a separate order denying defendant's request that it find the juvenile-transfer statute unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the denial of the motion because defendant abandoned the sufficiency of the argument relating to the trial court's decision to deny his transfer, and defendant's arguments challenging the constitutionality of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-318 (2002) were not made in conjunction with a valid interlocutory claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sevier County Circuit Court, Arkansas, convicted defendant of possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to manufacture methamphetamine and possession of a controlled substance (methamphetamine). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the sheriff did not have probable cause to enter his home without a search warrant; that there was insufficient evidence to prove he was in possession of the drug paraphernalia with the requisite intent; and that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the amount of methamphetamine found was a &quot;usable&quot; amount. The appellate court determined that because defendant did not renew his directed-verdict motion following the State's rebuttal testimony, his sufficiency arguments were not preserved for appeal and the appellate court would not reach the merits of his argument. The law enforcement officers never served defendant with a writ of possession as required by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 18-60-307(a) (2003); instead, they served him with an order for immediate possession. For all practical purposes, the order of immediate possession and the writ of possession accomplished the same thing --entitling the plaintiff in a civil action to possession of the land. The sheriff acted in good faith in relying on a facially valid court order in executing the order of immediate possession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Nevada County Circuit Court (Arkansas) that convicted him of aggravated robbery pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-12-103 (Repl. 1997). Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, in-court and out-of-court identifications, and the denial of his motion to suppress clothes found in his home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The robbery victim identified defendant as the robber and described his clothing. Police went to defendant's home to investigate and defendant allowed the officers to enter. The officers saw similar clothing and brought the victim to defendant's home for an identification. On appeal, the court found that defendant failed to preserve his identification claims because he did not raise a contemporaneous objection at trial. The court noted that the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, but held that under the totality of the circumstances, there was no substantial likelihood of misidentification because the victim had a significant opportunity to view defendant, had previously worked with him, and knew him from the neighborhood. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction because he swung the stick at the victim, from which the jury could reasonably conclude he intended to cause serious physical injury. The court also held that defendant's clothing was in plain view, and that the police's action of going to defendant's home to seek assistance in a criminal investigation did not amount to a &quot;seizure&quot; under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owners challenged a decision from the Little River County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which entered judgment in favor of appellee city in an inverse condemnation and quiet title action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city owned property that was used as a dump, and the owners held title to adjacent property. There was a dispute over a portion of this land. The owners filed an inverse condemnation action, and the city filed a counterclaim seeking to quiet title. After the trial court entered judgment in favor of the city, the owners sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the owners were permitted to bring an inverse condemnation action under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 18-15-410(a) (2003). However, they were required to commence the case within the 7-year statute of limitations under Ark. Code Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 18-61-101 (2003). The appellate court rejected the argument that the city was required to possess knowledge that the claimed land did not belong to it. The evidence showed that the city had maintained the land in question since the 1950s. This was sufficient to derive intent to possess adversely. Moreover, neither the owners nor their predecessors in title filed suit against the city previously. As such, the statute of limitations had expired. Finally, there was no authority for the argument that the city should have been granted only an easement.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed with the State that defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of subdivisions (c)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) and (c)(1)(B) simply because he was charged and convicted under (c)(5). The appellate court found, however, that the legislature could authorize different maximum penalties for the same conduct if the law clearly defined the conduct prohibited. The State was authorized to seek the greatest penalty, the Class B felony, under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-403(c)(5). It was not so vague and standardless that it allowed for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, nor did the fact that the prosecutor exercised discretion in seeking the maximum penalty give rise to a constitutional infringement. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's request to provide additional jury instructions as he did not formally proffer any written instructions and there was no rational basis for issuing instructions on any lesser-included offenses.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that the error complained of was rooted in the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. The appellate court noted that the Arkansas Supreme Court, in a prior decision, held that double jeopardy precluded a conviction and sentence for both attempted capital murder and its underlying felony; therefore, the aggravated robbery conviction had to be merged with one count of attempted capital murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was approached by a loan officer at the bank who expressed an interest in financing the company's next project. The bank sent the company a conditional commitment letter for construction financing on a major project and the company owner resigned from his job and began work on the project. Subsequently, the bank declined the financing after the project was underway. Several lawsuits were filed against the company. There were also incidents of the bank telling clients that the company was not on its approved builders list, even though no such list existed. The court held that it could consider all of the bank's egregious conduct in connection with the harm that befell the company. The circumstances, viewed as a whole, would warrant a finding that the bank acted in a malicious manner calculated to do harm and that part of the bank's motivation could have been racial animosity. The court also held that given the unique facts, the punitive award was in line with due process considerations. The court also affirmed the amount on the cross-appeal by the company requesting to reinstate the original award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee for the Department of Humans Services (DHS) said, in an affidavit, that the child had been taken to an emergency room twice with severe bone fractures. As a result, the child was taken into DHS custody. At the probable cause hearing, the trial judge determined that the child could not be returned to the parents because of the multiple bone fractures. The mother testified that she did not know what caused the injuries. There were no abnormal findings for brittle-bone syndrome. The trial court found that it was in the child's best interests to terminate parental rights. On appeal, the parents alleged the trial court erred in refusing to allow them to present testimony from a physician at the reunification hearing. Nevertheless, it was at the adjudication hearing that physician's testimony would have been properly admitted. The parents, however, did not appeal the adjudication order; therefore, their arguments could not be heard on appeal.

The appellate court perceived no irritation on the judge's behalf. The comment that the judge would hold defendant in contempt demonstrated nothing more than his attempt to maintain the decorum and dignity of the court proceeding. Whether defendant refused to consent to a breathalyzer test was properly a question for the jury. Allowing a witness to present testimony was not hearsay as it was defendant's own. The trial court did not improperly restrict defendant's questioning of the witness regarding whether the witness, as a citizen, arrested defendant as it was irrelevant. Defendant failed to demonstrate that a witness's testimony was perjured. Defendant did not make his argument at trial that the court erred in engaging in ex parte communications with the State. Defendant did not object at the first opportunity to contest witness testimony, which precluded the appellate court's review of the issue.

He was sentenced to one year in prison and pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann &sect; 15:542(A), defendant was required to register as a sex offender in Louisiana, and he did so. Defendant moved to Arkansas after he was paroled to live with his mother. When defendant failed to register as a sex offender in Arkansas, he was arrested. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and the denial of his motion for a directed verdict because under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-12-904(a)(1) (2003) a person who failed to register as a sex offender was guilty of a Class D felony. The state supreme court had said that no scienter was required to trigger this provision; the offender's failure to register alone was sufficient. Further, it was irrelevant that solicitation for oral sex was not a crime in Arkansas that would require him to register as a sex offender because Arkansas law plainly provided that one who was convicted of a crime in another state and was required to register in that state as a sex offender was also required to register in Arkansas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company appealed from a decision of appellee, the Arkansas Tobacco Control Board, finding that the company had given its customers unlawful rebates on cigarettes. The decision was affirmed by the Pulaski County Circuit Court, Arkansas. The company asserted that the Board's decision was arbitrary and capricious and not supported by substantial evidence and Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-708, the controlling statute, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the facts showed the company was a wholesale distributor of tobacco products. It had developed a marketing plan which it believed would help keep it competitive and at the same time comply with Arkansas's Unfair Cigarette Sales Act, codified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-701 et seq. The Act, specifically Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-708, prohibited wholesale distributors of cigarettes from offering a &quot;rebate&quot; or &quot;concession&quot; to its customers that would have the effect of selling cigarettes below the cost to the wholesaler. The appellate court found the evidence established a positive correlation between cigarette sales and the amount of the rebate. Same constituted substantial evidence that the rebates that were given to the company's customers were sufficiently tied to cigarette sales so as to make them unlawful under the Act. Further, the company was barred from raising the constitutionality of &sect; 4-75-708 on appeal because that argument was not presented to the Board. Finally, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-704 contemplated a wholesaler being able to adjust its prices to meet competition; however, that statute did not allow a wholesaler to carte blanche resort to illegal rebates.</SPAN></P>

Under the plain language of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-26-302(6) (Supp. 2003), a family or household member who could be a victim of domestic battery included persons who had cohabitated together in the past. It was proved that defendant and the victim had lived together before the first crime was committed, and it was irrelevant that the victim was married to someone else. The presumptive sentence for defendant's crimes was &quot;regional punishment facility/alternative sentencing.&quot; However, the trial court departed from the presumptive sentence, as it was authorized to do under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-90-804 (Supp. 2003), pursuant to written findings of the severity of the victim's injuries. The sentence did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment rights as it was within the statutory range and defendant waived a jury trial and consented to judicial sentencing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and appellee wife were married in 2000 and separated in 2003. However, they had lived together for a total of six years, and the husband had a child by a prior marriage. In the parties's divorce action, the Pulaski County Circuit Court, Arkansas, found that the wife stood in loco parentis to the child since he was 18 months old and granted her visitation rights. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The biological mother's parental rights had been terminated. The appellate court held that the instant case was distinguishable from both United States Supreme Court precedent and Arkansas Supreme Court precedent, which concerned grandparent visitation. In the latter cases, the respective trial courts' decisions to allow grandparent visitation, contrary to the parent's wishes, where said parents were deemed fit, were overturned, as in violation of the respective parents' fundamental parenting rights. The appellate court held that, in the situation where a person stood in loco parentis to a child (as in the instant case), rather than a person or persons who simply had a relationship with the child, the finding of an in loco parentis relationship was different from the aforementioned grandparent relationships because it concerned a person who in all practical respects was a parent. The appellate court held the status of in loco parentis permitted, where circumstances warranted, that a stepparent be granted visitation with a stepchild, and such circumstances were present in the instant case. Thus, the trial court properly granted visitation rights to the wife as a stepparent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas) awarded appellant property owner $ 35,000 as just compensation for appellee city's taking of the owner's property for use in a park project. The court denied the owner's motion to dismiss for failure to state facts, stating that the complaint clearly stated the parties, the purpose for the taking, the legal description, and the estimated just compensation. The owner and the city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner contended that the trial court erred in denying his Ark. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state facts. The appellate court held that, as the owner proceeded to trial after losing a motion to dismiss, it was hard to see the prejudice he suffered from not reviewing the denial of the motion. He had notice of the facts supporting the claims made against him and could have utilized the other procedural devices available in preserving the issue. Next, the owner argued that the trial court erred in finding that the city had established a public purpose for the taking. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 18-15-301(a)(1) (2003) gave a municipality the ability to condemn private property to create a park. The resolution authorizing payment for the property was introduced. The owner pointed to evidence that he believed showed an ulterior motive on the part of city officials. However, whether he thought the property was necessary was not the issue. The issue was whether the city believed that the property was necessary to accomplish the purposes of creating a park. The trial court found that the city could take the property, implicitly finding that there was a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee waited two years to appeal the department's determination that the employee had maltreated a child while employed in a daycare center. At the hearing before the administrative law judge on the appeal, the employee's counsel indicated that the statutory notice set forth in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-12-512 violated the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. The counsel did not elaborate on the constitutional issues before the administrative law judge, but, rather, waited to develop them until she reached the trial court. By doing so, the counsel failed to properly preserve the issues for appeal. The agency level was better equipped by specialization, insight through experience, and more flexible procedures than courts to determine and analyze legal issues affecting the agency. Because that was not done, the employee was barred from making those arguments in the instant appeal.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the ALJ ruled that appellee employer and its workers' compensation carrier were entitled to an offset for the benefits paid by the claimant's health-care plan. The Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission affirmed the ALJ with respect to the offset. The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sustained a back injury while working for his employer. The employer and its workers' compensation carrier refused to pay the claimant's medical expenses. Consequently, those expenses were partially paid by the claimant's health-care-plan provider. After the ALJ determined that the claimant's injury was compensable, the ALJ determined that the employer and its carrier were entitled to an offset for the medical expenses that were paid by the health-care-plan provider. The appellate court found that, under the plain meaning of the language in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-411(a), it was clear that medical expenses that were paid directly to the medical provider were paid on behalf of the claimant and that the workers' compensation benefits payable to the claimant were properly reduced dollar-for-dollar. Also, allowing the offsets, pursuant to the clear language of &sect; 11-9-411(a), did not violate Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-109 (2002), which stated that the claimant could not be required to pay the employer's workers' compensation premium. Finally, the Commission did not err when it found Ark.

Defendant appealed, arguing that the Garland County Circuit Court (Arkansas) erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to an invalid warrant, his motion to dismiss for violation of the speedy-trial rule, and his motions for directed verdicts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 14- year-old girl told her mother that defendant gave her and her young friends alcohol and that she saw nude photographs on defendant's computer of other 14- or 15-year-old girls. In a search of defendant's home pursuant to a warrant, police found CD-ROMs showing a 14- and a 15-year-old girl dancing and posing provocatively in the nude; labels characterized the pictures of the girls in obscene terms. The appellate court held that the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of violating &sect; 5-27-304(a)(2). However, the search warrant affidavit was fatally flawed because (1) it did not state when the informant observed criminal activity and contraband in defendant's home, and (2) did not contain information from which a permissible inference could be drawn as to when the minor saw the contraband. Therefore, the trial court erred in not suppressing the evidence. The good-faith exception could not save the search warrant, as reliance on it by the police officers executing it was unreasonable. And as defendant was granted a continuance of over four months, this time period was not counted for speedy trial purposes, and there was no violation of the speedy trial requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court imposed an illegal sentence because his two prior convictions arose out of the same incident, and, pursuant to Ark.

The appellate court agreed with the State's argument that defendant's challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court's finding that he was an habitual offender with two prior convictions had to be argued in the trial court in order to preserve the issue for appeal. Defendant's contention that the appellate court could address his argument on appeal because it involved an illegal sentence, rather than the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court's finding that he was an habitual offender, was without merit. Defendant's argument was not preserved for appellate review, because he failed to object to the proof of his habitual-offender status during his resentencing.

Defendants appealed, asserting the trial court abused its discretion in denying their motion for a continuance when the State amended the information eight days before trial, and in denying their motion for directed verdict. Defendants asserted the State failed its burden of proving their status as persons in a position of trust.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were openly homosexual, and the evidence established that they did engage in deviate sexual activity with the victim, who was somewhat developmentally delayed. Defendants argued that when the &quot;catch-all&quot; phrase regarding &quot;temporary caretaker,&quot; and &quot;in a position of trust or authority,&quot; under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-14-124(a)(3), was read in conjunction with the rest of the statute, the intent was for the language to cover persons with a particular charge or position in caring for the victim. They asserted they were simply social friends, and could not be convicted under &sect; 5-14-124(a)(3). However, the appellate court held there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have determined that defendants were in a position of trust in relation to the victim. Secondly, eight days before trial, the State amended the information from rape, a higher charge. Defendant's argued they were prejudiced because they were required them to change their defense. However, they waited until the day before trial to file their motion for continuance, the crimes were not overly dissimilar, and based on the totality of the circumstances, the trial court properly denied a continuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children, one of whom was mentally ill, were placed in the care and custody of the Department after being found to be dependent-neglected. Over the next two years, the Department engaged in efforts to provide services to prevent removal and unify the family. However, after the mother continually failed to comply with the case plan and court orders, the Department ultimately sought the termination of the mother's rights. The trial court did so, and the court affirmed on appeal. The Department proved by clear and convincing evidence that, for years, the mother had been unable to provide for the needs of the children and she remained unable to do so. In addition, the mother had a history of living on and off with a man who was declared to be dangerous to the children. The trial court's decision to terminate rights was therefore not clearly erroneous. Because the mother's claims that her rights were terminated without due process of law were not raised in the trial court, the claims were not properly preserved on appeal. Nonetheless, the court found no merit to the contention. The admission of the mother's medical records was not improper under the applicable rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Faulkner County Circuit Court (Arkansas) granted appellee State's petition for emergency custody of appellant parents' newborn son. After a second hearing, reunification services were not offered to the parents with regard to the newborn due to the severity of abuse and neglect against their other children, who were already in state custody. Parental rights were terminated by court order on July 19, 2002. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' first point of error was that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-341(b)(3)(B)(ix)(a)(4) (Repl. 2002) was unlawfully applied to their healthy, premature newborn. They argued that &sect; 9-27-341 could not be interpreted to condone taking away parental rights to a newborn child regardless of how the parents were living and behaving at the time of the birth of the child. The appellate court did not find those arguments persuasive. The department of human services investigator testified that she obtained the initial 72-hour hold on the newborn because of the parents' history of domestic abuse, drug use, and very little or no prenatal care for all the children. The investigator stated her belief that it was contrary to the best interests and welfare of the newborn for him to remain in his parents' custody. He had been removed for his own safety and well-being. The appellate court held that &sect; 9-27-341(b)(3)(B)(ix)(a)(4) enabled the State to protect a child in just such a case as the case at bar, without waiting for abuse and neglect to occur directly to the newborn. It would have been tragic and cruel to have required the newborn to have undergone the same fate as befell his siblings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the felon in possession of a firearm charge, as well as the simultaneous possession of drugs and a firearm charge, because of the degraded condition of the alleged firearm. The item he possessed was rusted, generally covered in dirt, and had mud in the barrel and he asserted that the officers could not tell whether the gun was capable of firing. Because the rifle was designed to be used in a manner consistent with Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-1-102(6) (Supp. 2001), the rifle was a firearm within the ordinary meaning of the words used by the legislature. Defendant next argued that there was insufficient evidence that he possessed cocaine because the State failed to prove that the seized cocaine was a useable amount as required by Harbison. Defendant conceded that he made no challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on that ground to the trial court, but urged plain or fundamental error. Based on the holdings of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, the appellate court had no choice but to reject defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence because it was not raised below and was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

CR98-37. HON. CHRIS PIAZZA, JUDGE.  <BR>McGhee v. State, 350 Ark. 49, 84 S.W.3d 423, 2002 Ark. LEXIS 439 (Ark., 2002)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of manufacture of a controlled substance, methamphetamine, in the Perry County Circuit Court, Arkansas. The trial court sentenced defendant to 15 years as recommended by the jury. Defendant appealed the application of the 70 percent parole-eligibility rule to his sentence for manufacture of a controlled substance, arguing it violated both the federal and state constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's offense occurred in May 1998. At that time, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-93-611 (Supp. 2001) provided that a person convicted of certain crimes would not be eligible for parole until he served 70 percent of his sentence, but &sect; 16-93-611 did not include manufacture of methamphetamine. Section 16-93-611 was amended by 1999 Ark. Acts 1268, to add methamphetamine offenses, thus, making the manufacture of methamphetamine subject to the 70 percent parole-eligibility rule. The new amendment became effective on April 9, 1999. Therefore, defendant correctly asserted that the application of the 70 percent parole-eligibility rule to his sentence for manufacture of methamphetamine would have been an ex post facto law in violation of the federal and state constitutions. However, defense counsel never raised an objection to the jury instruction or the application of the 70 percent parole-eligibility rule to his sentence at trial. The appellate court held defendant's case did not come within the scope of any of the recognized exceptions to the contemporaneous objection rule, and Arkansas did not adhere to the &quot;plain error&quot; rule. Thus, defendant's argument was not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband and wife separated after the husband had an affair with his girlfriend and the wife had an affair with another woman. In their divorce action, the trial court held that the husband owned two businesses that were marital property, and it divided the parties' property, awarded the wife custody of the parties' children, child support, and alimony, but denied her request for attorney fees. The court also found that the husband committed perjury when he testified about his income, and it held him in contempt and ordered him to perform 50 hours of community service. The appellate court held that: (1) the record supported the trial court's finding that, although the husband endorsed a stock certificate for a plumbing business to his father, the husband retained ownership of the business; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding the wife $ 100 per month in alimony, $ 1,037 per month in child support, and custody of the parties' children, or by denying the wife's request for a one-half interest in one of the husband's businesses and payment of her attorney fees; but (3) the trial court erred by holding the husband in contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motorcyclist sued defendant city, a garbage truck driver, and the city's self funded vehicle insurance program, in a negligence action in the Faulkner County Circuit Court (Arkansas). The trial court dismissed the driver and the program from the suit. The trial court granted an Ark. R. Civ. P. 60(a) motion for the reduction of the jury's award against the city from $ 92,500 to $ 25,000. The motorcyclist appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorcyclist argued that Ark. R. Civ. P. 60(a) was not applicable because it should only be used to correct the record, not to do something which, in retrospect, ought to have been done. The appellate court found that if the trial court had allowed a $ 92,500 verdict against the city to stand, a miscarriage of justice would have occurred. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 21-9-303(b) (Repl. 1996) clearly provided that the city's maximum liability was $ 25,000. Thus, the appellate court held that the trial court's use of Ark. R. Civ. P. 60(a) to conform the verdict to the limits of the law was not an abuse of discretion and was the logical rule to use under the circumstances of the case. The appellate court held that the motorcyclist was not prejudiced by dismissing the driver and the program from the lawsuit. The appellate court stated that the motorcyclist obtained the maximum amount available against the city and the driver combined under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 21-9-303(b) (Repl. 1996). The appellate court found that the driver could be held personally liable. The appellate court found that the motorcyclist had failed to preserve the issue of the constitutionality of the statute for its review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club filed a petition to declare ABC Reg. 5.48 unconstitutional and for other relief. On that date at least three other cases involving those parties and the challenged regulations were in various stages of litigation. The division filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted. Further, the day after the hearing in which the trial court granted the motion to dismiss, the individual filed a motion to intervene. The trial court denied the motion as being moot pursuant to Ark. R. Civ. P. 24 because the case had been dismissed on August 1, 2001. The court affirmed, stating that the individual failed to file the motion timely and had knowledge of the action from the beginning as demonstrated by his signature on several of the documents that were filed in the action. Appellants next contended that the trial court erred in not declaring ABC Reg. 5.48 unconstitutional, a violation of civil rights, and due process of law. However, the court stated that the issue concerning a private-club exception from the Alcoholic Beverage Laws Act was never address below. Therefore, it could not be considered for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court previously ordered the trial court to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction. The court then granted the workers' motion for rehearing, withdrew its prior opinion, and considered the case on its merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The workers were injured when a stairway in an apartment building they were working in collapsed during a renovation project being performed by the workers' employer. Another company replaced the stairs. Neither that company nor the employer were parties to the action. The workers alleged that the building owners were negligent in failing to warn of the dangerous condition of the stairs. The trial court granted summary judgment on the grounds that the employer was an independent contractor and the building owner owed no duty to the workers. The appellate court originally ordered the action dismissed under the &quot;prime contractor&quot; rule contained in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-105(a) (Repl. 2002), but withdrew its order, as the statute had been declared unconstitutional. Ruling on the merits, the appellate court held that summary judgment was inappropriate, because there were material issues of fact as to whether repair of the stairs was a part of the employer's job and whether the workers were required to work around the stairs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) denied appellant company's motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting an administrative proceeding initiated by appellee, the Arkansas Tobacco Control Board. The Board had notified the company that it was charged with violating the anti-rebating provisions of the Unfair Cigarette Sales Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-708(b) (Repl. 2001). The company appealed, asserting the act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the company requested a hearing before the Board, it filed an action in circuit court before the hearing was held. The company prayed for preliminary and permanent injunctions, and a declaration that the anti-rebating provisions of the Act, and the regulations were unconstitutional. The circuit court found that the company had failed to demonstrate a threat of irreparable harm to justify injunctive relief. Because the circuit court did not rule upon the company's constitutional argument, the appellate court did not address that issue. The appellate court noted it was clear that the exhaustion-of-administrative-remedies doctrine applied even when statutes were challenged as unconstitutional. Moreover, it was a recognized doctrine that relief be sought, before a party resorted to declaratory procedure. The Board exercised jurisdiction over the matter by notifying the company of the violation, and the company requested an administrative hearing. Hence, it was clear that the company was not entitled to file a declaratory-judgment action under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 25-15-207 (Repl. 2002) before the company exhausted its administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had an insurance contract in Arkansas. The insurance policy provided no-fault medical coverage. After an accident in Colorado, the injured parties contended that they were entitled to additional coverage because Colorado had higher no-fault limits. The insurer filed a declaratory action to determine the amount of coverage that it owed to the injured parties. Both sides filed motions for summary judgment. After the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the injured parties, the insurer sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the law of Arkansas applied. The only connection with Colorado was that it was the site of the accident. That was not significant enough to merit the application of its law. Moreover, the injured parties were not precluded from recovering the full amount of their medical expenses. The injured parties' no fault claim was subject to Arkansas law; therefore, the limiting provision of Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. 10-4-713(1) did not apply. Arkansas was not required to substitute Colorado's law for its own. Finally, the court held that the contract itself did not require the insurer to meet the no-fault coverage laws of other states.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant engineer was brought before appellee Arkansas State Board of Architects for the unlawful practice of architecture without a license. The Board held that the engineer practiced without a license, that the attorney general, who represented the Board, did not need to be disqualified, and a civil penalty was imposed. The court dismissed the engineer's original appeal, but the Arkansas Supreme Court remanded the matter to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board received a complaint that the engineer was unlawfully practicing architecture. The Board held the allegations in the complaint well-founded and imposed a civil penalty. On appeal, the engineer first contended that the statutes defining the practice of architecture and engineering, Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 17-15-102(5)(A)(i) and 17-30-101(4)(A) (Repl. 2001), were unconstitutional. Because the Board did not rule on the constitutional issue, the court remanded the case. The court held that the mere fact that the engineer engaged in planning and designing a building was not enough to prove that he unlawfully practiced architecture. Thus, the Board was also directed on remand to consider whether the engineer's actions fell within the definition of the practice of engineering. In light of the remand, the civil penalty was vacated. The court affirmed the decision that the attorney general did not need to be disqualified from representing the Board. Although the attorney general also represented the Arkansas State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers, there was no indication that both Boards were likely to develop adverse interests in this litigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and reversed in part. The court affirmed the decision that disqualification of the attorney general was not required, and the court remanded the matter for further fact-finding regarding the finding that the engineer practiced architecture without a license. The civil penalty was vacated.</SPAN></P>

HONORABLE TOM KEITH, CIRCUIT JUDGE.  <BR>&nbsp;Wayne Alexander Trust v. City of Bentonville, 345 Ark. 577, 47 S.W.3d 262, 2001 Ark. LEXIS 441 (2001).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city passed seven ordinances condemning seven homes owned by appellant trust. The trust filed a Notice of Appeal and Designation of Record. The Benton County Circuit Court (Arkansas) found the city's decision was not arbitrary and capricious, and the seven homes constituted a nuisance and required abatement. The trust appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the trust argued that the ordinance and condemnation proceedings violated the separation of powers doctrine by divesting the courts of judicial power and vesting the judicial, executive, and legislative powers with the city, and that the ordinance and condemnation proceedings allowing the city council to serve as lawmaker, judge, jury, and executioner, violated procedural due process. The appellate court rejected the trust's arguments. The court noted that the separation of powers challenge required the trust to serve the attorney general with the pleadings under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-111- 106(b) (1987). The failure to do so by the trust resulted in the appellate court refusing to consider the argument. Additionally, the city did not violate due process. Under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-56-203 (1998), the city had the police power to order the removal or razing of the houses in the interest of the public health and safety of its inhabitants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee commission obtained a default judgment against appellant driver, awarding the commission $ 4,910 for default on a promissory note and suspended the driver's commercial driver's license, which was entered after the driver was served by warning order and failed to respond. The driver moved to set aside the default. The municipal court denied the motion, and the Pulaski County Circuit Court (Arkansas) affirmed. The driver appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the driver argued, inter alia, that Ark. R. Civ. P. 4(f) was unconstitutional, as, by permitting a warning order to be published in the county where the action was filed rather than the driver's county of residence, it was not calculated to give the defendant notice of the proceedings against him. The appellate court rejected the driver's arguments. The court noted that service by publication was constitutionally permissible in the case of persons who were missing or unknown, and Rule 4(f) provided a method of service reasonably calculated to give the driver actual notice of the proceedings. Further, when the driver executed the promissory note with the commission, he agreed that, if a lawsuit were filed, he would submit to the jurisdiction of Pulaski County. Under the circumstances, Rule 4(f) met the constitutional requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee agency filed a motion seeking $ 41,200 in delinquent child support from appellant father. The father contended that he relied upon the parties' agreement that he was not to pay child support, as the children were with him half the time and he supported them by providing housing, food, and clothing. The Benton County Chancery Court (Arkansas) concluded that the father was liable for the entire arrearage. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the father argued that the trial court erred in its determination of the amount of back child support that he owed, by rejecting his defense of equitable estoppel. The father contended that evidence supported the defense of equitable estoppel, as he timely paid support until the parties agreed to forego child support in exchange for joint custody. The appellate court held that the trial court's refusal to consider the applicability of the doctrine of equitable estoppel was erroneous as a matter of law. The court noted that the use of equitable defenses to prevent the enforcement of child-support orders, including arrearages, was supported in prior case law. Therefore, the trial court's refusal to consider the applicability of the doctrine of equitable estoppel was error. The court did not hold that the doctrine should be applied, but only that on remand the trial court was directed to consider its applicability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Pulaski County Circuit Court, Arkansas, granted judgment in favor of appellant homeowner, in the homeowners' action for a claim of conversion against appellees, pawn shop owner and house cleaner. The pawn shop owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pawn shop owner argued that Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-27-202 and 203 unconstitutionally deprived him of his property interest in pawned property without due process of law, because they provided for his relinquishment of his interest in a pawned item without a pre-deprivation hearing to determine its ownership. The appellate court found that in the first decision, the trial judge simply found that the homeowner had not met his burden of proving that the jewelry was his property. Given his finding that the homeowner failed to meet his burden of proof, it was not necessary that the trial judge determine whether the statutes deprived the pawn shop owner of due process. Also, that question was not at issue in the first appeal, and it was not expressly or implicitly addressed. Therefore, the circuit judge's finding on remand that the appellate court held the statutes to be unconstitutional was clearly erroneous. The award of attorney fees was proper, as the homeowner clearly stated in his pleadings that he brought the action on the basis of Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-27-202 and 203, not replevin.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant case was the third lawsuit the owner filed against the board; all three cases involved the same issue: whether the board had the legal authority to regulate the hours of operation of private clubs in Arkansas.

The appellate court held the chancellor did not err in finding that appellant had an adequate remedy at law.

He failed to show how enforcement of the board's regulation, which prohibited his club from dispensing alcoholic beverages between 5:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., would case him to suffer irreparable injury.

The trial court found that the defendant consented to a search of his vehicle, which recovered contraband. The defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia (a cigar case) because it was unreasonable to interpret the statute so broadly as to criminalize possession of that object. The court of appeals disagreed. The defendant possessed a cigar case in which methamphetamine and marijuana were hidden. The jury could have concluded that the case was used as a container to conceal controlled substances. Such an object fit squarely within the statutory definition of drug paraphernalia. The defendant also argued that the stop of his vehicle was not justified. The court of appeals disagreed and held that the encounter was authorized under Ark. R. Crim. P. 2.2. The officers were executing a search warrant and found evidence of a methamphetamine lab when the defendant came onto the property. The officers were permitted to approach defendant to ask for identification and inquire about the purpose of his visit.</SPAN></P>

The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized during a roadside search. The court of appeals disagreed. The arresting officer was justified in doing a pat-down search. The officer testified that after the defendant stopped his motorcycle, he threw an object into the field and zipped his coat up to the neck. The defendant appeared to be guarding something on his left side. The defendant next argued that the officer lacked probable cause to arrest him for disorderly conduct during the pat down, and thus the search incident to arrest was also improper. The court of appeals disagreed. After the officer warned the defendant that he would place him under arrest if he did not allow him to complete the pat down, the defendant then jerked away as the officer continued to pat down his left side. The defendant raised his voice and cursed at the officer and pointed his finger close to the officer's face. The officer had the authority to arrest the defendant without a warrant because of his disorderly conduct. Once the defendant was under arrest, Ark. R. Crim. P. 12.1 allowed the officer to do a full search of the defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his attempted rape conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence, and that former Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-90-121 (1997), regarding use of a &quot;deadly weapon&quot; was void for vagueness, and that a screwdriver was not a deadly weapon. The appellate court disagreed. The evidence presented was that defendant spread the victim's legs apart, unbuckled his pants and had them to his knees, and told her that he wanted to show her something, while intermittently holding a screwdriver near her stomach. The court held that was sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that defendant had the intent to commit rape. Defendant then argued that the term &quot;deadly weapon&quot; in former Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-90-121 (1997) was void for vagueness, and, alternatively, that a screwdriver was not a deadly weapon. The appellate court held that &sect; 16-90-121 conveyed fair and sufficient warning when measured by common understanding and that a screwdriver used under the circumstances described by the victim qualified as an object that in the manner of its use or intended use was capable of inflicting death or serious injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DHS sought license revocation due to the provider's failure to comply with regulations requiring a certain ratio of adults to children in daycare operations.

Two subsequent monitoring visits evidenced she was still out of compliance and included failure to maintain safety requirements and failure to maintain medical records violations. DHS revoked her license. She sought administrative review. Four follow-up monitoring visits evidenced she was still out of compliance. She asserted the violations were not so severe as to warrant revocation of her license. DHS appealed the trial court's reversal of the ALJ's decision, arguing the ALJ's decision was supported by substantial evidence.

</DIV>

On appeal, he argued there was insufficient evidence to prove the alleged delivery took place within 1,000 feet of a school. Further, he argued the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a new trial, and the statute on enhanced punishment for selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a school was unconstitutionally vague. The court initially noted Ark. R. Crim. P. 33.1(a) (2000) provided that an accused who failed to move for a directed verdict at the close of the State's case and again at the conclusion of all the evidence waived any question pertaining to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict. The court held appellant failed to preserve his arguments for review by either moving for a directed verdict or stating specific grounds therefor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought a conditional use permit to place manufactured homes in a residential subdivision he was developing. Appellee denied appellant the permit due to strong opposition from subdivision owners, and the trial court upheld the decision, having found that the manufactured homes had a very different appearance from the site-built homes. On appeal, the instant court affirmed. The court held that the trial court properly interpreted the relevant zoning ordinance, Little Rock, Ark., Code &sect; 36-107(2). The trial court did not err by failing to apply presumptions that accompany a conditional use application's review because application of those general principals did not mandate a different result. In exercising its discretion, the trial court determined that the aggregate placement of manufactured homes was not compatible with the existing neighborhood's character, and there was concern about the effect the manufactured homes would have on property values.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction in the Greene County Circuit Court, Arkansas, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of drugs and firearms, arguing the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his person and his vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was pulled over for a traffic infraction. After appellant was unable to provide proof of insurance, he conducted a pat down search. Drugs were removed from appellant's pocket and his vehicle was impounded. An inventory search of the vehicle revealed further drugs and a handgun. Prior to trial, appellant sought to suppress the evidence, arguing it was illegally seized from his person and vehicle. The trial court denied the motion and appellant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and a firearm. He appealed the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress. The court noted if an officer lawfully patted down a suspect's outer clothing and felt an object whose contour made its identity immediately apparent, there was no invasion of the suspect's privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer's search for weapons. The court held the officer failed to articulate any permissible reason for going into appellant's back pocket other than an impermissible belief contraband was contained therein. The court reversed, holding the search of appellant's person was unconstitutional and the attendant impounding of his vehicle was unlawful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because the arresting officer's reason for removing the contraband from appellant's pocket was not sufficient to show the item's incriminating nature was immediately apparent or that he had reason to believe the item was a weapon. Further, the officer improperly impounded the vehicle for failure to produce proof of insurance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Through the use of a confidential informant, police garnered a warrant to search appellant's home for narcotics. The search warrant did not contain a no-knock provision. As police sought to execute the warrant, they noticed a person open a curtain, look outside, and pull the curtain back. The officers rushed to the front door, announced their presence and authority, waited two to three seconds, and broke down the door. Drugs, a weapon, and cash were recovered. Appellant filed a motion to suppress, challenging the search as unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion, finding exigent circumstances, and appellant pleaded nolo contendre to possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. He appealed his conviction. The court admonished the requirement for police to knock and announce was not merely perfunctory and a time interval of two to three seconds was not sufficient to establish officers were constructively denied entry into the home to warrant exigent circumstances. The court reversed, holding the officers violated appellant's constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures and their conduct was not supported by exigent circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed, because the officers failed to abide by the knock-and-announce rule and no justifiable exigent circumstances existed to warrant the officers' conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sued appellee seeking workers' compensation benefits, and seeking additional benefits under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-505 (1996). Appellant alleged appellee willfully discriminated against him because he had filed a workers' compensation claim. The Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission awarded appellant temporary total disability benefits, but denied benefits under &sect; 11-9-505. Appellant challenged the decision, arguing that the commission denied him due process by substituting its own credibility determination for that of an administrative law judge (ALJ), and by overturning the ALJ's credibility determination. The court held that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-704(b)(6(A) adequately protected a claimant's due process rights. This statute allowed the commission to review numerous factors other than witness credibility. This included the plausibility of the witness's testimony, the consistency of the witness's testimony with the other evidence and testimony, and others. The court held the commission's determination that appellee did not violate &sect; 11-9-505 was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment, based upon a jury verdict, of the Crawford County Circuit Court (Arkansas) convicting her of manslaughter and sentencing her to a total of 96 months in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An infant boy in appellant's care was admitted to a hospital in an unconscious state. The boy's brain had suffered trauma. Ultimately, the boy was removed from a mechanical ventilator, and he died. Appellant agreed to accompany investigators to the police station. At the station, appellant signed a written waiver of her Miranda rights. Later, she confessed she had shaken the boy &quot;hard.&quot; After being charged with murder, appellant's motion to suppress her confession was denied. In addition, the trial court prohibited her from introducing the testimonies of two witnesses. Upon review, the court found appellant's confession was properly admitted, as she was not unconstitutionally seized during her interrogation session with police, and her confession was voluntary. Judgment was reversed with regard to the trial court's exclusion of testimony that an investigator contacted a witness and tried to get him to influence appellant to change her original statement to police. The admission of the proffered testimony could have been proper self-contradiction impeachment testimony, as investigator had previously denied asking the excluded witness to persuade appellant to change her statement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's confession to the police during custodial interrogation was properly admitted at trial, because it was given voluntarily after appellant had arrived at the police station by her own choice. Judgment was reversed in part, however, as trial court improperly excluded proffered witness testimony that would have impeached a prior statement made by one of the chief police investigators in appellant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the ruling of the Pulaski County Circuit Court, granting appellees' motion to dismiss appellant's complaint for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-92-607, prohibiting a nonprofit, tax exempt, or governmentally funded hospital from holding an interest in a licensed pharmacy, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A non-profit hospital's application for a license to run a pharmacy was denied under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-92-607, prohibiting granting this license to a non-profit hospital. The hospital formed appellant, a for-profit corporation, which applied for a pharmacy license. The license was denied on the same grounds. Appellant challenged this ruling. Appellant also brought a separate declaratory judgment action seeking to have the statute in question declared unconstitutional. Appellees' motion to dismiss based on the pendency of another action between the same parties and on appellant's failure to exhaust administrative remedies was granted and appellant sought review. Appellant had to exhaust administrative remedies, including presenting its constitutional challenge to the administrative agency, before pursuing a declaratory judgment action. The actions appealing an adverse administrative ruling and challenging the constitutionality of a statute were not identical, so dismissal of the second action due to the existence of the first would have been incorrect if appellant had exhausted its administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dismissal of appellant's action was affirmed because appellant failed to exhaust administrative remedies, including presenting constitutional challenge to administrative agency as the agency could have decided the statute did not apply to appellant, rendering a constitutional challenge moot. Dismissal because of existence of another action between same parties was incorrect.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the convictions, arguing that the trial court erred by denying his request for funds for additional psychiatric evaluations and his motion to suppress his confession. The court affirmed the convictions after determining that appellant was provided with a psychological expert for a challenge to his competency as required by law and that appellant was not entitled to additional funds to shop for an expert until he found one who would declare him incompetent to proceed with trial. The court also found appellant's confession to have been made voluntarily and with a knowing waiver of his Miranda rights because appellant initially refused to speak with police without a lawyer present and appellant later initiated further communication with the police wherein he confessed to the charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed the judgment of the Benton County Circuit Court (Arkansas), convicting him of aggravated robbery and theft of property and sentencing him to 40 years' imprisonment on the robbery conviction and 15 years' imprisonment on the theft conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was found guilty of aggravated robbery and theft of property. On appeal he argued the trial court erred in not finding the Arkansas peremptory-challenge statute facially unconstitutional, by not making a determination of appellant's waiver of his right to testify on the record, in failing to require the prosecutor to produce the prior statement of a testifying witness, and in admitting a plea agreement into evidence. The court did not address the peremptory-challenge argument because defendant did not show that the challenged statute had a prejudicial impact on him or on any juror. The court found defendant waived his right to testify by not invoking it at trial; defendant failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the trial court's ruling on the prior statement of a testifying witness; and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing a plea agreement into evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed because the trial court did not err in finding the Arkansas peremptory-challenge statute constitutional, not making a determination of defendant's waiver of his right to testify on the record, failing to require the prosecutor to produce a witness' prior statement, or admitting a plea agreement into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the Arkansas Workers' Compensation Commission, which awarded appellant attorney's fees under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-715 (Repl. 1996), as inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The workers' compensation commission (commission) awarded appellant attorney's fees under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-715 (Repl. 1996). On appeal, appellant argued that &sect; 11-9-715 should have been interpreted to allow the commission the discretion to award attorney's fees based upon the length and complexity of the services offered by the attorney in a particular case. The court found that the commission awarded appellant's counsel the maximum statutory attorney's fees. While the court was sympathetic to appellant's argument, it was unable to remedy the situation. The statute at issue was clear. It established a maximum attorney's fee which could have been awarded in controverted claims before the commission. Appellant's remedy was with the legislature. The court could not have altered the clear meaning of the statute. Appellant did not raise this argument before the full commission, and a question not passed upon below presented no question for decision here.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order affirmed; the statute established a maximum attorney's fee which could have been awarded in controverted claims before the workers' compensation commission, the court could not have altered the clear meaning of the statute, and appellant's remedy was with the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with violating City of Marvell, Ark., Ordinance No. 134, commonly known as the garbage ordinance. This ordinance provided for a monthly charge to be levied by the appellee, City of Marvell, against residents of the city for the collection of garbage. Appellant refused to pay the assessment, and was found guilty of violating the ordinance; he appealed the conviction to the county circuit court, arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The county circuit court held the ordinance to be constitutional, and appellant brought this appeal. The court held the city had the authority to enact the statute pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 8-6-21. The court also held that appellant did not meet his burden of proving that the ordinance was unconstitutional as a result of its selective application to him, because he offered no evidence to support this point.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment which found appellant guilty of violating the garbage ordinance was affirmed. Ordinance was constitutional in enactment and as applied to appellant.</SPAN></P>
