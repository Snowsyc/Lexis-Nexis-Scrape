</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners filed suit against defendants, a county and various officers thereof, seeking to compel a county to conduct a countywide reassessment (CR). A decision that the use of 2002 base year market value violated the Uniformity Clause (UC) of the Pennsylvania Constitution was affirmed on appeal, and the matter was remanded for a determination of the county's progress in executing a CR and in setting a timeframe for completion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners brought suit, alleging that use of the same base year market value for an indefinite number of years violated the UC. The court ruled in favor of the owners, finding that the lack of a requirement for periodic reassessments violated the UC. That decision was, for the most part, affirmed on appeal. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court remanded the matter. Upon remand, a conference was held but the parties could not agree on a realistic timeframe for completion of the CR. A trial was held, wherein one expert testified for each party. The court found no basis to order an interim assessment as desired by the owners, as it was not deemed in the interests of justice. Further, the court determined that the Supreme Court was not expecting such relief pending completion of the CR. The court also noted that the CR was anticipated to be done in a timely manner. The county failed to offer a CR plan and consequently, the court adopted a four-district CR plan for the county to implement. The court discussed the strengths and weaknesses of its plan, noting that it would entertain a different plan from the county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the owners' request for an interim reassessment, and ordered the county to perform the four-district CR plan that the court set out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a court's denial of his pretrial motion to suppress physical evidence, and the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9712.1. Defendant was convicted of various drug and weapons offenses, in violation of 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 780-113(a)(16), (30), (32) and 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 908(a). The court submitted an opinion in support of a denial of defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with multiple offenses. His motion to suppress physical evidence and statements, and for a pretrial writ of habeas corpus, was denied. After a stipulated bench trial, defendant was convicted of all charges and sentences were imposed. Defendant appealed therefrom, and the court opined that the appeal should be denied. The court noted that defendant was a participant in an accelerated rehabilitative disposition (ARD) program pursuant to 61 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 331.27b. A probation officer needed to verify defendant's compliance with the conditions of the ARD supervision, and had reasonable suspicion based on defendant's nervous conduct. Accordingly, the officer's claim of authority to search the room was valid. Further, the officer had authority over defendant pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. P. 316. A statement made by defendant was not the product of custodial interrogation, such that Miranda warnings were not required. The mandatory sentence was properly imposed under &sect; 9712.1(a), as it was not void for vagueness, an overbreadth argument was not ripe, it did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and it was not disproportionate to the criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court recommended denial of defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Plaintiff brought a defamation suit against defendants following an election of officers that occurred in the society. Plaintiff had unsuccessfully run for president of the society.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff asserted that one defendant's statement that if plaintiff was elected as the society's president, he would fire its executive director was defamatory as were statements criticizing him that were made in a campaign letter. The court found that plaintiff was a public figure for the limited purpose of the society's election. The court found no malice on the part of the one defendant who made the statement as to plaintiff possibly firing the society's executive director if elected. The court further held that plaintiff failed to show how the passages in the campaign letter were defamatory. The court noted that describing a person's political philosophy was not defamatory. The court further found that the evidence clearly showed that one defendant's published comments in a campaign letter regarding plaintiff, communism, and anarchism were substantially true. Additionally, defendants showed that statements made on a website were substantially true and contained no outright false statements. The court rejected plaintiff's assertions in his motion for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners filed a procedural validity challenge to appellee township's zoning ordinance, East Penn, Pa., Zoning Ordinance No. 1996-94 (1996), alleging that there were procedural errors at the time that the Ordinance was adopted. The challenge was filed pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5571.1(a) of the Judicial Code and 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11002-A(b) of the Municipalities Planning Code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' land was used as a quarry for mining and excavation, and it was located in rural and rural residential zoning districts that were established by the Ordinance. They filed an appeal in the nature of a procedural validity challenge to the Ordinance, based on their alleged inability to expand their mining and excavation operations. It was noted that there was no zoning prior to the adoption of the Ordinance, which established a comprehensive zoning plan. The court found that notice of a summary of the proposed Ordinance was properly published, a copy was filed in the law library, and re-advertisement of amendments was not required where they were not shown to have been substantial pursuant to 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10610(a) and (b). The final version of the Ordinance was not submitted to the County Planning Commission as required by 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10607(c). The court concluded that the Ordinance was not void ab initio, as the challenge was untimely and not within the limitation exemption of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5571.1. The owners did not show that they had standing to challenge the Ordinance on due process grounds under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants owned two tracts of land in the township, which covered 400 acres. Another lawsuit involved a developer challenging the township's ordinance at issue, which provided that prior to development, a landowner had to set aside a certain amount of farm soils and meet certain dimensional requirements. That case resulted in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court invalidating the township's ordinance. Appellants filed their underlying suit only six days after that decision. The court held that once a court has determined that a zoning ordinance or provision is constitutionally invalid, subsequent applicants, such as appellants, are put on constructive notice of the municipality's intent to enact an amendment. The court found that the township's declaration to amend the zoning ordinance at issue at its next available public meeting was reasonable. The court refused to place the burden on the township to outrace appellants to announce a cure amendment first. The court further determined it acted within its discretion by denying appellants' motion to supplement the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owned approximately 163.9 acres of land located within the township's agricultural preservation zoning district. The zoning ordinance at issue required that, prior to subdivision or development, a landowner had to set aside a certain percentage of land for farmland and provided a minimum lot size of at least one acre for any single family residences. The Supreme Court declared that the soil set-aside regulation was valid but struck down the minimum lot size requirement as unreasonable. Subsequently, the township adopted an ordinance curing the deficiencies and directly addressing the concerns raised by the Supreme Court. The court upheld the township's denial of appellant's challenge, finding that the township acted quickly and within a reasonable time declaring its intention to amend the zoning ordinance and thereafter doing so. The court refused to grant the appeal on the sole basis of the Supreme Court's holding in the other case. The court found no error with regard to denying appellant's motion to supplement the record with additional evidence since appellant failed to establish that it was denied the opportunity to be heard or that relevant evidence was excluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's condominium unit had a set assessed value at the time that he purchased it. Thereafter, the Board sustained the district's appeal and increased the assessed value by more than 75 percent. The owner sought judicial review, alleging that the revised assessment (RA) was excessive and discriminatory in relation to comparable properties. The court initially noted that the owner's claim that the RA was a spot assessment was misplaced and lacking in merit pursuant to 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5453.706 and 5453.702. Further, the relevant market value was properly determined under 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5453.702(b)(1) and 5453.704(b)(1). The Board did not err in the methodology used for purposes of an original assessment and an assessment appeal, as they were statutorily authorized. Lastly, the court found that the RA resulted in an unconstitutional lack of uniformity in violation of Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The owner met his burden of showing the widespread disparity in the assessed values of comparable properties, which was pervasive, substantial, and arbitrary. Accordingly, the court determined that uniformity required assessment at the original value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had pled guilty in Delaware to the felony charge of unlawful sexual penetration and registered as a lifetime registrant with the Delaware Sex Offender Registry. He moved to Pennsylvania, where he was charged with failing to report to the Pennsylvania State Police an address change, his change of employment, and the termination of his prior employment. His sole argument was that persons who, like himself, were subject to life-time registration under &sect; 9795.1(b)(4) were not included under &sect; 4915(a)(1) because &sect; 9795.1(b)(4) was not specifically listed. The court held that a criminal defendant subject to lifetime registration was necessarily subject to the lesser 10-year registration and, therefore, was a person &quot;subject to registration under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.1(a)&quot; pursuant to &sect; 4915(a)(1). Defendant knew and understood that if Megan's Law penalized 10-year registrants for failing to register, it would most assuredly penalize lifetime registrants who failed to follow the registration requirements for sexual offenders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed an omnibus pretrial motion for a writ of habeas corpus as to the charge of murder of the first degree and a motion to declare the death penalty, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9711, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's girlfriend and her daughter were found dead. The common pleas court held that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the charge of murder in the first degree of the daughter. The Commonwealth presented evidence that defendant arranged to meet with the girlfriend and daughter on the day of the homicide and was present at the girlfriend's apartment the day of the homicide. Defendant admitted to killing the girlfriend, fabricating an alleged suicide note, and staging the scene to look like a murder-suicide perpetrated by the girlfriend. The Commonwealth presented evidence that the girlfriend did not kill the daughter. The evidence showed that defendant would mistreat the daughter and that he resented paying child support to the girlfriend. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had upheld the validity of Pennsylvania death penalty. Section 9711 was not a denial of equal protection of law since it created categories for which the death penalty could be imposed and was rationally related to a legitimate state objective. It did not violate the Separation of Powers Doctrine. It was the legislature's province to determine the punishment imposable for criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The common pleas court denied defendant's motion for habeas corpus and his motion to declare the death penalty unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an evidentiary hearing, the court denied defendants' motions to suppress evidence. After a non-jury trial, the court found both defendants guilty of possession of a small amount of marijuana under the Controlled Substance Act. The trial court (Pennsylvania) sentenced first defendant to 15-30 days imprisonment with credit for time served and second defendant to probation. Both defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both defendants argued that the administrative warrant did not provide probable cause for the search of their residence and therefore, the information obtained was procured illegally and could not justify the subsequent issuance of a search warrant. The court disagreed, concluded that the administrative warrant furnished probable cause to search defendant's residence. A reasonable person could have inferred from the squalid condition around the outside of the house that the inside was unsanitary, infested, or contained filth and contamination, justifying an inside inspection. Contrary to first defendant's contention, the court found no evidence that the administrative search was a pretext to search defendants' residence for drugs. The court further concluded that there was probable cause for the search warrant, as a code enforcement officer and a police officer observed evidence of a crime in plain view while lawfully inside the house executing the administrative warrant. First defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. The court found sufficient evidence, concluding that, inter alia, he was in constructive possession of the marijuana pipe found in his bedroom.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sued defendants, corrections officers and medical staff, claiming that his placement in a cell with a prisoner known to be violent and the denial of medical treatment after he was attacked violated his constitutional rights. The court granted the medical staff's motion for summary judgment. The officers filed preliminary objections to the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's lawsuit was prison conditions litigation and was governed by the Prison Litigation Reform Act. The court found that the objections asserting the statute of limitations, failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and sovereign immunity were improper because they were not among the grounds listed in Pa.R.C.P. No. 1028. Under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1030, those claims had to be pled in a responsive pleading under the heading &quot;New Matter.&quot; The inmate alleged no facts suggesting an agreement to violate his civil rights. His assertion that defendants acquiesced in double-celling him and attempted to cover up their involvement was insufficient to maintain a claim for conspiracy. The allegation of retaliation was stated in a single sentence and was insufficient to support a claim upon which relief could be granted. Inmate was not entitled to Pa. R. Crim. P. 108 habeas corpus relief. The Department of Corrections' grievance system provided adequate post-deprivation remedies to inmates in satisfaction of the Due Process Clause, and the inmate had not availed himself of these mechanisms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained those objections pertaining to the claims of conspiracy, retaliation, loss of job, respondeat superior, personal involvement, duty to protect, habeas corpus, negligence, and injunctive relief. The court overruled those objections pertaining to the state law claims. The court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action and declined to allow an amended complaint to be filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, and criminal conspiracy. Defendant received a total sentence of 60 to 120 months. Defendant appealed. Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), the trial court entered its opinion in support of its judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mandatory sentence of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9712.1 was imposed. Defendant argued that &sect; 9712.1 was overly broad, but did not specify what protected act was criminalized by &sect; 9712.1(a) that made it so. While it was generally true that possession of a firearm could have been a protected activity, &sect; 9712.1(a) required much more. Mere possession of a firearm alone was not prohibited and would not have resulted in the mandatory sentence. It appeared that, the defendant's claim was a challenge to the &quot;proportionality&quot; of the sentence. However, a successful Eighth Amendment challenge, in a non-capital case, was exceedingly rare. Only an extraordinary case resulted in a constitutional violation, and defendant's sentence did not lead to an inference of gross disproportionality. A five-year mandatory sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the gravity of defendant's crimes. It was clear that the requirements of &sect; 9712.1(a) had been satisfied, warranting the imposition of the mandatory sentence. Defendant was convicted under 35 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 780-113(a)(30), and the testimony at trial was that a handgun and four bags of cocaine were found in &quot;close proximity&quot; to each other.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that because people have divergent ratios of breath alcohol relative to blood alcohol, the partition ratio upon which the conversion ratio relied was inaccurate and the breathalyzer-test results premised on that ratio were scientifically unreliable.

The common pleas court concluded that defendant's assertion that the Commonwealth must meet the Frye test before his breath test results were admissible was without arguable merit. The heavy weight of judicial and legislative acceptance of the accepted conversion ratio countered defendant's contention that the possibility of error pointed to a lack of general acceptance in the scientific community.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The court held a hearing on the request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs failed to show that an actual case or controversy existed regarding the Philadelphia, Pa., Lost or Stolen Firearms, Protection from Abuse, and Imminent Threat Ordinances because they had not demonstrated a concrete injury that was causally traceable to the complained-of action by defendants and which could be redressed by the judicial relief requested. Hence, plaintiffs' challenge to those three ordinances was procedurally barred. Plaintiffs had alleged sufficient injury to challenge the Philadelphia, Pa., Straw Purchaser and Assault Weapons Ordinances because those two ordinances directly affected their constitutional right to sell, transfer, purchase, and possess firearms under Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The Assault Weapons and Straw Purchaser Ordinances were preempted by &sect; 6120 because they impermissibly regulated the possession, ownership, transfer, or transportation of firearms that were not unlawful under the Pennsylvania Constitution. Moreover, assault weapons were not unlawful under 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 908's catchall provision. Finally, it was also not unlawful for a Pennsylvania resident to purchase more than one firearm in any one month period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city, the mayor, and the city council were permanently enjoined from enforcing the provisions of the Philadelphia, Pa., Straw Purchaser and Assault Weapons Ordinances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee breached fiduciary duties by failing to make the required annual distributions under I.R.C. &sect; 4942 for 34 years, thus subjecting the trust to possibly astronomical taxes and penalties and depriving the beneficiaries of the monies that should have been distributed. No annual statements or fee schedules were offered, nor was there proof that the fees were competitive under 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7768(d). A commission on principal was unreasonable given the fiduciary duty breaches. The beneficiaries had vested rights; it would violate the Fourteenth Amendment to retroactively apply 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7185(b) (repealed) and 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7768 (2006), that repealed the prohibition on the trustee from taking commissions on principal, as both executor and trustee. There was also a lack of proof as to the commissions on income. The trustee never made any election, &quot;actual&quot; or &quot;deemed,&quot; under 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8113. The trustee's alleged &quot;deemed&quot; election was just a tactic to re-define &quot;income&quot; and &quot;principal&quot; to evade the statutory prohibition on the same trustee receiving commissions on principal as both executor and trustee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee's claims were denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Movant Commonwealth attorney general (AG) filed objections to non-movant bank's request for payment of $ 46,731.64 from the principal of a perpetual charitable trust it administered. The court set forth its accounting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trust was established pursuant to a will dated 1938 by a deceased individual who gave the residue of her estate in trust to pay the net income to certain annuitants (all of whom were deceased), and, to pay the balance of the net income to a hospital association (now a medical center), for the perpetual upkeep, maintenance, and support of a certain memorial surgical building. The bank's predecessor received commissions on the principal for its services as executor of the deceased's estate. The predecessor then served as the trustee under the will. The bank calculated its commissions by applying its fee schedule to the market value of the principal in the trust and allocated the resultant figure 70 percent to principal and 30 percent to income. The AG claimed that the bank was barred by the Rule of Williamson's Estate from receiving principal compensation in the sum of $ 46,731.64 on the approximately 27 percent of the present trust principal which was subject to the rule. The court found that later sections of the Uniform Trust Act did not apply retroactively. The AG's objections had to be sustained because the payments were barred by relevant caselaw.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The AG's objection was sustained. The credits that totaled $ 46,731.64 would be stricken from the account; and, the sum of $ 46,731.64 would be added back to the balances available for distribution under the trust.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The common pleas court held that the husband failed to preserve any issue for appellate review. However, it addressed the legal and evidentiary bases for its decision to exercise judicial supervision over the wife's estate. The decisions to declare the wife an incapacitated person, to appoint a plenary guardian for her person and her estate, and to protect her jointly held assets were based on clear and convincing evidence. Upon a finding of incapacity, the jurisdiction of the common pleas court extended over the wife's estate pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 711(10). Its jurisdiction further extended to all property the wife held jointly with the husband because she held an interest in the entirety of such property and not merely in a discrete part thereof. All assets the wife held jointly with her husband were held in tenancy by the entireties by virtue of their marriage. Barring the husband from liquidating, transferring, or dissipating the property he held jointly with the wife without prior court approval did not violate his procedural due process rights. He did not have an unfettered right to transfer, liquidate, or dissipate the real estate properties he held jointly with the wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The common pleas court recommended that its decision be affirmed and that the appeal be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a class of property owners (POs), filed suit against defendants, a law firm and the principal shareholder, arising from defendants' unlawful collection of fees and costs in their representation of municipal entities and school districts for delinquent real estate taxes and other delinquent municipal claims under the Pennsylvania Municipal Claims and Tax Liens Act, 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7106 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agreements that defendants had with the municipalities indicated that their fees would be compensated by collection from delinquent taxpayers. Defendants also routinely charged interest and administrative fees to the taxpayers. The POs filed suit and a class was certified to include POs who were sent communications by defendants related to delinquent taxes, and who were charged unauthorized amounts during the two-year class period that preceded the filing of the suit. The court initially went through the class prerequisites under Pa.R.C.P. No. 1702 and found that they were all satisfied for purposes of certification of the class. It held that it had jurisdiction, based on an analysis of the applicability of 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7106(a.1). The elements of unjust enrichment were sufficiently proved with respect to the conduct of the firm, and also as to the shareholder under the participation theory of liability. The improper fees and interest collected were not authorized under 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7103 and 7143. Further, the unauthorized charges warranted recovery under the Pennsylvania Loan Interest and Protection Law, 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 101 et seq., including double damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered a verdict in favor of the class of POs and against the firm and its sole shareholder and awarded the class damages for unlawfully received attorney's fees, unlawfully collected administrative fees, interest unlawfully collected, administrative fees, statutory interest, penalty and punitive damages, attorney's fees, the doubling of some of the unlawfully collected amounts, and an accounting.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty to violating Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 3121(c), 902, 3122.1, 3123(b), 3125(a)(7), 3126(a)(7) and 6301(a)(1), defendant appealed  the court's sentence and determination that he be declared a Sexually Violent Predator (SVP). He challenged the evidence and the constitutionality of the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9791 et seq., commonly known as Megan's Law III. The court rendered an opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), the court found that defendant met the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia and the criteria for classification as an SVP. There was overwhelming evidence that he began sexually assaulting his stepchildren in the 1980s and replicated the pattern of abuse 22 years later with his step-granddaughter. The conclusion that he maintained and promoted his relationship with his step-granddaughter to facilitate and support her victimization met the 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9792 definition of &quot;predatory.&quot; The court rejected the constitutional challenge, finding that (1) defendant agreed to a stipulated SVP hearing; (2) he provided no witness testimony or other evidence to challenge the constitutionality of 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.5 or any other provision of Megan's Law III; (3) he did not prove that he was capable of being cured of pedophilia; and (4) unsuccessful treatment was a significant factor in reoffense. Defendant, therefore, failed to meet his substantial burden in establishing that Megan's Law III was unconstitutionally overbroad or excessive. Similarly, he failed to provide any evidence that Megan's Law III was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foregoing represented the reasons for the court's August 17, 2007, judgment of sentence and determination that defendant was a Sexually Violent Predator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, a homeowners association, its members (HOA), and an adjoining property owner (APO) (respondents), filed preliminary objections challenging a petition for the appointment of a board of viewers under the Pennsylvania Private Road Act (PRA), 36 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2731 et seq., filed by petitioner landlocked property owner seeking to have a private road established to provide access to the owner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court overruled the first objection, which was based on the 30-day limit for service under Pa.R.C.P. No. 401(a), as there was no limitations issue, and the result of sustaining the objection would have been further delay. No prejudice was shown, and the laches defense failed. The delay and lapse of time was not so unreasonable that the petition had to be dismissed. It had been held by binding precedent that PRA procedures satisfied procedural due process requirements. The appellate court stepped into the shoes of a sitting Allegheny County judge to whom the petition otherwise might have been assigned, and intended to process the petition as if no assignment had been necessary. The taking of land for a private road easement under the PRA was not an unconstitutional taking under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV, and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 9, and 10. The proposed road opening was not purely for private, as opposed to public, purposes and was constitutional. If the APO desired to participate as a prospective user of the private road, she had to file join the petition as a petitioner under 36 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2761.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The preliminary objections to the petition were granted as to the objection that the petition improperly sought to grant the APO permission to use the proposed road, and the request that the APO be granted access to the road was stricken. In all other respects, the preliminary objections were overruled.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed preliminary objections pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. No. 1028(a)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and sentenced to three to eight years of incarceration. The prisoner alleged that the department deprived him of due process of law by housing him in solitary confinement for over two years based on the psychologist's recommendations and by failing to agree to the terms of a parole plan that would lead to his release. The court found that the prisoner could not maintain a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against the department or the board, as they acted in their official duties on behalf of the state and could not be considered &quot;persons&quot; under &sect; 1983. The prisoner also failed to allege specific conduct against each individual. The prisoner was not deprived of a constitutionally protected liberty interest because solitary confinement was not atypical treatment of a prisoner and he was not mistreated or deprived of any necessities. The prisoner could not challenge the length of his prison sentence in his &sect; 1983 claim because he did not seek a writ of habeas corpus. Furthermore, defendants were entitled to sovereign immunity under 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2310 because they acted within their official duties or employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendants' preliminary objections and dismissed the prisoner's claims against them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court were the consolidated appeals of appellant property owners from decisions of appellee city council, denying their applications for waiver or exemption from Emmaus Borough, Penn., Ordinance 989, which required them to install sidewalks on their properties. The court previously denied the city's motion to quash the appeal of one of the property owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Emmaus Borough, Penn., Ordinance 989 contained no standard whatsoever for evaluating applications for waiver or exemption. Yet the city invited such applications. The letter inviting applications for relief did not identify any legal standards by which the applications would be considered, and council never adopted any standards in subsequent legislation. As a result, the council was left with unbridled discretion to grant or deny such requests. The record reflected that the council took a growing number of factors into consideration with each new request for waiver or exemption, resulting in unpredictable outcomes and unequal treatment. Thus, the waiver/exemption procedure did not meet due process requirements. Neither Emmaus Borough, Penn., Ordinance 989 nor any subsequent legislation established a standard for waiver or exemption requests to be evaluated on a uniform and consistent basis. Consequently, the property owners were deprived of liberty and property rights without due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals were sustained, the decisions of the city council on the property owners' requests for relief were reversed, and the property owners were not required to install sidewalks on their properties under Emmaus Borough, Penn., Ordinance 989.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with theft by unlawful taking, theft from a motor vehicle, receiving stolen property, and a violation of the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act. Defendant filed an omnibus pre-trial motion seeking release by habeas corpus and suppression of a statement he gave to police while in custody and any seized evidence arising from his alleged unconstitutional interrogation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was under arrest at the time of his interrogation and statement. The evidence presented proved that defendant was given his Miranda rights and signed the written warnings advisement prior to the inception of any questioning which led to his admissions. Accordingly, the motion to suppress was denied and dismissed. However, the Commonwealth's evidence at the preliminary hearing was comprised solely of hearsay testimony. Thus, but for defendant's statement, the evidence against him was legally insufficient to establish a prima facie case. Under the corpus delicti rule, the Commonwealth first had to show by competent evidence that a crime had been committed before defendants' statement implicating himself in its commission could be used. Aside from the officers' hearsay testimony there was no competent evidence without defendant's statement admitting the crime, no gun, no car keys, no victim testimony, no corroborating witnesses to the theft, not even a written victim statement or the reasonable prospect the victim would come forward to testify at trial. Accordingly, the court concluded that the Commonwealth had failed to present a prima facie case by competent evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress was denied. Defendant's motion for a writ of habeas corpus was granted and he was ordered discharged from custody on one information only, without prejudice to the Commonwealth to rearrest him if it could prove a prima facie case consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a husband and wife, filed an asbestos mass tort action against defendant asbestos companies, alleging that the husband contracted mesothelioma as a result of his exposure to asbestos products. The trial court granted defendants summary judgment and dismissed with prejudice all claims against them. Plaintiffs appealed; pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925, the trial court entered its opinion in support of its judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three companies, in support of their summary judgment motions, asserted lack of sufficient product identification. The court noted that during his deposition, the husband failed to establish that he was exposed to any asbestos fibers shed from the companies' products -- an essential element of plaintiffs' products liability claim. It rejected plaintiffs' contention that New Jersey law required a lesser standard of proof of exposure to asbestos products to be able to go to a jury. Plaintiffs also argued that in granting summary judgment to one company, the court erred in failing to consider the husband's supplemental affidavits submitted pursuant to former Pa.R.C.P. No. 1035(b) and (c). The court noted that in his deposition, the husband testified that he worked with that company's caulk sealants and glazing compounds, but had no personal knowledge whether those products contained asbestos. In his supplemental affidavit, he swore that had he been asked, he would have testified to exposure to some of the company's other products identified in an attached list. As this contradicted his deposition testimony, the court found that the affidavit was incredible and patently self-serving.</SPAN></P>

Ct. R. L300, from an adjudication of defendant Pulaski Township Board of Supervisors (Pennsylvania) which issued a one year revocation of the owner's license to operate the business based on a violation of Pulaski Township, Pa., Ordinance &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The revocation was based on the owner's alleged violation of Pulaski Township, Pa., Ordinance &sect; 18 by operating the business on Flag Day, June 14. The owner argued, inter alia, that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague in that it: (1) did not specify the actual days or specific holidays it alleged were state recognized holidays, and (2) did not specify even where or how to identify such holidays. The court found, however, that 44 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11 defined the designated holidays in the state of Pennsylvania. Therefore, the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because the state recognized holidays were specifically defined by statute. The ordinance provided adequate notice of the prohibited conduct in that reasonable minds were not left to guess at its meaning.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered its opinion in support of its judgment granting summary judgment in favor of defendant successor. Plaintiffs, a class of persons allegedly exposed to asbestos, appealed the court's order granting summary judgment to defendant. Plaintiffs' suit alleged that they were exposed to asbestos while working at various job sites that manufactured, sold, or installed asbestos products.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's liability for the asbestos exposure was unique since it was not the result of any direct liability but rather as a result of its acquisition of an asbestos manufacturing corporation. The court granted summary judgment to defendant upon determining that 15 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1929.1 absolved defendant from liability. Section 1929.1 limited asbestos-related liabilities to corporations incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania before May 1, 2001 that arise out of mergers or consolidation. On appeal, plaintiffs asserted that &sect; 1929.1 violated the federal Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution. The court disagreed, concluding that the statute did not treat foreign corporations differently than domestic corporations when liability was based upon direct culpability. Therefore, there was no discrimination against foreign companies or discrimination in favor of domestic companies. The court further found no violation of equal protection since the statute did nothing to alter the liabilities of those entities directly liable as opposed to the numerically insignificant defendants whose liability arose from successor liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court recommended that the order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two lawsuits against, respectively, defendants, a county, and defendants, the county, its Chief Executive, and its Chief Assessment Officer, plaintiff homeowners alleged that Pennsylvania's base year method of assessing property violated the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's assessment laws which permitted real estate taxes to be levied on assessed values established by the use of a base year market value for an indefinite number of years. Allegheny County, for example, used 2002 as its base year. This meant that real estate taxes for 2007 were determined by using the 2002 fair market value of taxpayers' properties. Under a base year system, market fluctuations between 2002 and 2007 were not considered. The court found that provisions of the General County Assessment Law (72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5020-402(a)) and the Second Class County Assessment Law (72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5452.4(a.2)) which allowed a county to arrive at actual value by using a base year market value without requiring reassessments violated the Uniformity Clause because (1) base year assessments were not intended to assess all properties at the same percentage of assessed value to actual value, (2) base year assessments inherently caused significant disparities in the ratio of assessed value to fair market value, and (3) base year assessments inevitably discriminated against owners of properties in lower-value neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among other orders, by March 31, 2008, the Chief Assessment Officer of Allegheny County was to complete a computer-assisted reassessment for use in 2009 similar to the reassessment the Officer prepared in February 2005 for use in 2006. By March 31, 2009, the Officer was to complete a computer-assisted reassessment for use in 2010 similar to the reassessment prepared in February 2005 for use in 2006.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under a state law, plaintiff control board had to be appointed after too many students in the school district scored below standardized test levels. The control board had the power to operate the school district in place of the elected school board. The elected board still had the power to levy taxes. They used that power to undermine the control board's authority. The control board sought removal of the four elected board members allegedly responsible. Following a hearing, the trial court ordered their removal. The four elected board members dismissed the attorney who represented them and replaced him with another attorney who had a close relationship with them. That other attorney did not file any post-trial motion within 10 days of their removal, as was required by Pa.R.Civ.P. No. 227.1. Another attorney hired to represent them on appeal did not petition to file a nunc pro tunc motion to file a post trial motion until after their appeal had been filed. The trial court found that the four elected board members did not show a permissible reason for not timely filing the post trial motions or explain why it took them nearly five months to petition for a nunc pro tunc filing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the elected board members' motion for the court to accept post trial motions nunc pro tunc.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth argued that the court erred in not finding that defendant waived his right to litigate the motion to suppress because it was untimely filed, pursuant to Pa. R. Crim. P. 578, 579, 581. Because the Commonwealth acknowledged that they were prepared to proceed with the motion, the court did not abuse its discretion in heating the motion; the Commonwealth was afforded every opportunity to establish that the stop in question was proper. The Commonwealth also asserted that the court erred in granting the motion to suppress. The court disagreed, concluding that the officer's observations of defendant did not establish probable cause to believe that defendant had violated a provision of the motor vehicle code. Observing accelerating tires that caused a peel out was insufficient to justify the stop in question. The court was unable to discern how the racing on highways statute was violated when there was no evidence of sustained exhibition of speed acceleration on the highway. The officer's observation that the vehicle accelerated its tires for 2-3 seconds causing it to spin and squeal was insufficient to justify a stop of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff executor of decedent's estate appealed the court's order which granted summary judgment to defendant manufacturer and defendant corporation and dismissed with prejudice all claims against the manufacturer and corporation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer asserted that the executor offered no evidence that decedent was exposed to or inhaled any asbestos fibers from an asbestos containing product manufactured by the manufacturer. The executor's response conceded that based on the testimony it was unclear whether the executor and decedent were exposed to asbestos in the manufacturer's product. The corporation had argued that the claims were barred pursuant to 15 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1929.1 and 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 5502 and 5524.1. The executor essentially argued that the record established genuine issues of material fact as to decedent's exposure to asbestos from the manufacturer's products and that the granting of summary judgment was error. However, the available record failed to establish that decedent inhaled asbestos fibers from a product manufactured by the manufacturer. The executor failed to establish that decedent was exposed to any asbestos fibers shed from the manufacturer's product. There was no evidence that the products used were dry products. Because the executor could not show that decedent had inhaled asbestos, both the manufacturer and corporation were entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers first argued that the proposed amendment required that it emanate from a government study commission. The court found that precedent was to the contrary. The taxpayers also argued that the proposed question violated the five year moratorium for changes of the form of government of a home rule municipality. Eliminating an elected sheriff and substituting an appointed sheriff was changing the form of government. Defendants argued that the moratorium only dated from the original effective date of a Home Rule Charter. However, appellate case law made this position untenable. The taxpayers then argued that because the county's charter was adopted pursuant to its own charter law, the only moratorium was five years from the adoption of the original charter. This position contravened the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. &sect;1991, and violated the county's home rule charter itself and its administrative code.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth argued that it was error to suppress the blood alcohol content evidence. The trial court requested that the appeal be denied. The officers did not possess reasonable grounds, reasonable suspicion, reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts, and/or probable cause that defendant was DUI. Defendant was placed under arrest at the accident scene when she was ordered to enter an ambulance to be transported to the hospital for investigative purposes. Defendant was informed that she was not free to leave. Other than a statement that an emergency medical technician might have smelled something that might have been alcohol on defendant, there was no indication of any indicia of intoxication. The officers improperly relied solely on the occurrence of the accident when placing defendant under arrest. Therefore, the officer lacked the requisite reasonable suspicion necessary to request defendant to submit to a chemical test. Further, under the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; doctrine the subsequent request and collection of defendant's blood for chemical testing purposes had to be suppressed due to the illegality of her initial detention by the officers.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 5860.601-5860.803, which authorized the tax sale at issue, was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property was sold to plaintiff from a county tax claim bureau's repository for unsold property, maintained pursuant to &sect; 626 (72 Pa.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 5860.627(a) violated the Due Process Clause because it authorized the bureau to sell property out of its repository of unsold property without providing additional notice to the owner of that property. The trial court disagreed. Under the RETSL, only after repeated and multiple notices were given to the owner, and the property was exposed to successive upset and judicial sales, was the property placed in the repository. For all intents and purposes, by the time property was placed in the bureau's repository, the owner's interest in that property was terminated. Balancing the State's clear interest in collecting taxes against a property's owner's remote and amorphous interest in property that had been placed in the repository, the trial court held that &sect; 5860.627(a) did not violate the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator brought the instant action on December 1, 2005, and summary judgment had been granted on the basis that the action was time barred under 15 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1929.1 and 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 5502 and 5524.1. Noting that 15 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1929.1 limited asbestos-related liabilities of Pennsylvania successor corporations incorporated prior to May 1, 2001, the court found that the state supreme court had previously decided that the statute violated the state constitution only when it purported to dismiss a claim that accrued prior to its enactment. 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5524.1(b) enacted subsequent to the supreme court decision provided that the limitations period in 15 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1929.1 would not apply to an asbestos claim for which the applicable period of limitation commenced on or before December 17, 2001. Because a former supervising judge of the complex litigation center had previously granted a global summary judgment to the corporation on claims filed more than two years after the enactment of 15 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1929.1 (after December 17, 2003), the court held that the summary judgment in the instant action was properly granted under the coordinate jurisdiction rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A commercial tenant filed a petition against a landlord to open a confession of judgment under Pa.R.C.P. No. 2959 for unpaid rent and other sums. The court denied the tenant's petition. The tenant appealed, and the court filed an opinion in support of its ruling under Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that the tenant had not shown a meritorious defense. The tenant alleged that it had not received possession of the leased premises until January 2005, damaging its business. The lease, however, allowed the tenant to cancel in the event the landlord was unable to give it possession of the premises. The tenant had not done so, but had participated in a zoning challenge and continued to renovate the premises. Moreover, although the tenant claimed to have suffered crippling financial losses, it appeared to have successfully located its recreational center to the leased premises, asserted that it was able to deposit over $500,000 with the court, and expressed a desire to continue its operations. Furthermore, although the tenant argued that the prohibition of alcohol upon the premises somehow justified its failure to pay rent, the tenant was fully aware of this prohibition before it took possession of the premises. Next, there was no merit to the tenant's due process challenge to Pa.R.C.P. No. 2952(a)(6). The rule clearly required a complaint for a judgment by confession to contain an averment of default, and the landlord had complied with the rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, writing in support of its decision, stated that the opening of the confessed judgment was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

IX, Historic Site Overlay District, of the Schuylkill Township Zoning Ordinance of 1955, as amended (Historic District Ordinance).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The structure at issue was a two-story house constructed in 1873, most recently used as an office and apartment. Neither the building nor the property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Township's Historic Resources Inventory. The trial court reversed, finding, preliminarily, no merit in the bank's contention that the township was required to exhaust its administrative remedies by filing a demolition permit as an application for such permit remained in the Board's jurisdiction. Section 908 of the Historic District Ordinance created a threshold requirement for eligibility by requiring a determination of local historical and/or architectural significance. While the township, pursuant to 53 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10616.1(d), proved that the building was over 150 years old, thus making it presumptively age-eligible for historic preservation, it failed to show that it had any historic, architectural, or archaeological value. Furthermore, the Historic Commission had taken no action to include the building or property in the Inventory, nor had either been proven to be eligible for that Inventory or the National Register of Historic Places pursuant to 37 Pa.C.S. &sect; 103.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city councilman sued defendant mayoral candidates to enforce a campaign finance ordinance limiting campaign contributions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidates said the state preempted the ordinance. A candidate could have his counterclaim against the councilman adjudicated after the councilman voluntarily dismissed his suit. Philadelphia, Pa., Code &sect; 20-1000 unconstitutionally tried to control the subject of comprehensive state legislation which did not let the city pass its own ordinance, even though the legislation did not restrict campaign contribution amounts. The ordinance's limit on contributions was an enlargement of power granted by the legislature and contradictory to a power the legislature retained. Because the city could only intervene to address the ordinance's validity, it had no standing to raise other issues. An interlocutory order in a subsequently abandoned suit filed simultaneously in another court did not collaterally estop an order on the same subject in the instant case because, inter alia, it was entered after the allegedly estopped order. An intervening candidate satisfied Pa.R.Civ.P. No. 2327(3) and (4) as he was a party to the original case and could have joined in a counterclaim prior to its discontinuance, and his rights would be governed by the ordinance if it stood.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff medical providers sued defendant private managed care organization (MCO), alleging claims of unjust enrichment under the Quality Healthcare Accountability and Protection Act (Act 68), 40 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 991.2101 et seq., and third-part beneficiary claims under the MCO's contracts with the state Medicaid administrator and the MCO's enrollees. The parties cross-moved to determine the law with respect to Act 68.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question was what amount of reimbursement was due out-of-network healthcare providers required to render emergency stabilization medical services to enrollees of a Medicaid managed care plan. In a case of first impression, the court concluded that no default rate for &quot;reasonably necessary costs&quot; had been mandated by Act 68. Thus, proper charges could not be determined as a matter of law. Moreover, the medical providers' own conduct belied their claim that the full published rate was their costs as they did not routinely collect those charges even from nonparticipating MCOs. In addition, the Medicaid rate was not the mandated reimbursement under Act 68. Rather, the &quot;reasonably necessary costs&quot; for medical treatment were factual questions to be determined based upon presenting symptoms and services rendered at trial. Trial of this case could be conducted by proof of reasonably necessary costs by procedure code. The burden of proof rested with the provider to demonstrate that the actual costs incurred were in excess of what had already been paid by the MCO.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based upon information provided by the parties, the most frequent medical services included were vaginal delivery without complicating diagnosis, normal newborn, and vaginal delivery with complicating diagnosis. A pretrial conference was scheduled for the purpose of determining how trial would proceed, initially limited to medical services rendered under those three specific procedure codes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son had completed the academic requirements for graduation the prior year.

By analogy, the court determined that despite the son's struggles for one year, his support should not be terminated as he had already met the relevant academic requirements for graduation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's appeal stated 10 separate claims. The trial court rejected each of them. The trial court stated, inter alia that (1) the theft of services charge was not a more specific penal provision requiring dismissal of the conflict of interest charge and defendant was found guilty of the more specific charge; (2) 65 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1103(a) was not unconstitutionally vague on its face or as applied and thus it did not violate the Due Process Clauses of either the federal or state Constitutions; (3) &sect;&nbsp;1103(a) was not overbroad either on its face or as applied as it was precisely defendant's conduct, the use of his office staff to work on his re-election campaign, that the statute was designed to criminalize; (4) the fact that a state ethics committee had ordered defendant to pay restitution did not mean that the criminal sentence imposed violated double jeopardy as the restitution order was not penal in nature; (5) the jury was properly instructed on the issue of a unanimous verdict and no Spencer charge was required; and (6) the evidence was more than sufficient to establish the elements of conflict of interest beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff advertising corporation appealed, as arbitrary and capricious, an adverse decision of defendant Zoning Hearing Board which denied its application to erect a freestanding billboard sign. The corporation alleged, inter alia, that the ordinances imposed a de facto and a de jure exclusion of billboards. The corporation also sought a validity variance and a dimensional variances from height and setback limitations and a lighting preclusion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sign was to be placed contiguous to a highway and its on-ramp. Existing improvements on the parcel included horse pastures, a house, and a barn. The corporation argued that Upper Oxford Township, Pa., Sign Ordinance art. IX.C proved the ordinance was de jure exclusionary by acknowledging only the intent to establish standards, rather than conveying permission or affirmatively granting the right to establish billboard uses in any of its zoning districts. The court agreed with the Board's conclusion that the sign ordinance permitted billboards as discrete uses and rejected the corporation's argument that because billboards were not enumerated in the sign ordinance as permitted &quot;uses&quot; they were excluded. Finding no error in the Board's conclusion that the ordinances made provision for billboards, the de jure challenge failed. Also, the de facto challenge failed. There was no justification in the record sufficient to compel a conclusion that a 300 square feet sign could not be readily seen from the highway. Thus, the Board properly denied a sign area variance. However, the Board erred in denying a variance in regard to a setback and height limitation as well as a lighting request.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the Board was affirmed except as to denying the request for dimensional variances from the setback and height limitations and from the lighting preclusion. The case was remanded to the Board to issue a variance to permit the corporation to locate two lights, one on each face of the billboard subject to the ordinances and to grant variances from the setback and height limitations to the extent determined necessary by the Board.</SPAN></P>

The township's ordinance limited billboard's to 40 square feet in height. The landowner asserted that the board's adverse decision was arbitrary and capricious. The court found no error with regard to the board's decision, finding that the landowner enjoyed a substantial existing use of the property and that there was no economic detriment or deprivation to it arising from the inability to use the property. The court found the township ordinance's limitation on the size of commercial signs in no manner was motivated by a desire to suppress noncommercial speech in favor of commercial speech and that the ordinance's regulation of signs by type and function was permissible.

</DIV>

A jury found in favor of plaintiffs. The superior court (Pennsylvania) denied the exchange's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and/or a new trial. The exchange appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The exchange argued that as a national securities exchange registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, all state tort claims against it were federally preempted. The common pleas court disagreed, noting that the subject claim was for assault and battery, not a disciplinary action involving trading activities, which would have been covered by the SEC's regulations. Notwithstanding waiver, the court of common pleas concluded that there was no error or abuse of discretion committed when the jury was instructed on the duty of care owed by the exchange, as there was testimony that the environment was hostile, cramped, and festered tension and unhealthy competition. Next, the common pleas court concluded that the admission of expert testimony on the subject injuries was not erroneous as, inter alia, the testimony was not a surprise to the exchange and a proper foundation was laid for the testimony regarding the subject injuries. Finally, the court of common pleas concluded that the jury verdict was supported by the evidence and was not a product of sympathy, prejudice, partiality, mistake, or corruption.</SPAN></P>

The parents argued that the district had violated their son's substantive due process rights. A Pennsylvania trial court granted the district's motion for a compulsory nonsuit at the completion of the parents' case in chief. It denied the parents' motion for post-trial relief. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son collapsed during a gym class and later died. He had a heart condition and was not supposed to have been participating in gym. The parents alleged that school nurses had never informed gym teachers that the son was not to participate in gym. The court held that the parents could not prevail under a &quot;state-created danger&quot; theory. They had not proven that the district's conduct shocked the conscience. There was no evidence that the nurses had disregarded a danger of which they were aware. Furthermore, the parents' own expert had testified that the son's death would have been avoided had an existing school policy on student records been followed; thus, it could not be said that the failure to adopt the parents' proposed policy showed deliberate indifference. Even if the parents could show conduct that shocked the conscience, they had not shown that the district had used its authority to create an opportunity for harm that otherwise would not have existed. Even if the parents had proven a violation of a constitutional right, they had not shown municipal liability because they had failed to identify a policymaker to provide testimony about the district's policies or lack thereof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered its opinion in response to an order under Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) with regard to plaintiff taxpayer's challenge to the dismissal of his complaint on preliminary objections by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. The taxpayer brought suit against defendants, a county, a borough, a school district, and various officials (the tax authorities), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, various damages, and attorneys' fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer asserted a claim under the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, contending that the tax authorities' assessment and attempted collection of real-estate taxes from him for a piece of realty he had put into an entity he called a trust violated the Contracts Clause of the United States Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment. The taxpayer had instituted a similar &sect; 1983 action for the tax years beginning with 1997. After the 2003 case was ultimately dismissed, he filed the instant action instead of appealing to the county board of assessment appeals. The court determined that the taxpayer failed to show the inadequacy of Pennsylvania's administrative tax remedies and that the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1341, among other sources of federal law, barred a state suit challenging taxation brought under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Further, the claim was already adjudicated against the taxpayer in the prior action, which the court found was worthy of the imposition of sanctions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court recommended that the trial court affirm its ruling on preliminary objections dismissing the taxpayer's challenge to the taxation of his realty or, alternatively, dismiss his appeal from its decision as frivolous. The court also requested that the trial court consider awarding sanctions against the taxpayer for his continued frivolous pursuit of the tax appeal.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 66.1-66.9, and a federal habeas corpus claim, both of which were unsuccessful. He filed his second PCR petition, and the public defender's office was granted withdrawal upon their no-merit letter. The court held that the petition was untimely under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9545(b)(1), and there was no showing that the 60-day grace period under &sect; 9545(b)(2) applied. The habeas corpus claims were untimely, and the requisite showing was not made for purposes of entertainment of the second petition. A review on the merits of the claims raised also indicated that there was no merit to them. There was no merit to claims regarding the failure to appoint counsel on the first PCRA appeal and on the direct appeal, and regarding the failure of all counsel to have argued that prior bad acts were erroneously admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the court upheld a hearing officer's decision regarding a zoning ordinance that established an Agricultural Preservation District, appellant corporation filed an appeal against appellee township board of supervisors. Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925, the court issued an opinion in support of its decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that there was substantial evidence that the overall effect of the ordinance was substantially related to the preservation of large, contiguous tracts of productive agricultural land. The uses allowed by special exception and conditional use would not destroy the land for future agricultural use in the manner of the proposed development by appellant, and other uses such as wildlife preserves would have no negative effect on the land whatsoever. Next, the hearing officer had severed three subsections of Union Township, Pa., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 905.3 as being too restrictive. The court stated that the subsections were severable under 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1925 and case law and thus did not invalidate the whole section. The ordinance stated that it was intended to be severable, and the subsections were not interdependent and were capable of separation in fact. Finally, the hearing officer properly found that in enacting the ordinance, there was no intent to keep appellant from developing its land. Moreover, even if there was such intent, the state of mind of a legislative body in enacting a zoning ordinance was irrelevant to a determination of its validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Control Board members filed suit against defendant Elected Board members, claiming that the Elected Board violated various provisions of the Education Empowerment Act (EEA), 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;17-1701-B to 17-1716-B. Due to the exigency involved in the case, the court only addressed the Control Board's requests for quo warranto, mandamus, injunctive relief, and a portion of the request for declaratory judgment relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Harrisburg School District was classified as an Acutely Distressed District, and the Control Board was put in place under the EEA. In other litigation, the Elected Board had challenged the constitutionality of the EEA. The court stated that one of its objectives was to more precisely define the authority, powers, and prerogatives of the parties when operating under the EEA and that it was limiting its opinion to the critical issues that had to be resolved before the end of the school district fiscal year of June 30, 2006. The court held that, as a matter of law, the Control Board was given all powers of 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 6-693, 6-694, and 6-695, and that the Elected Board was divested of all power to act without the approval of the Control Board, except for the power to levy taxes. As such, the Elected Board was obligated to authorize whatever tax the Control Board directed them to levy to satisfy the fiscal obligations of the school district. The court determined that the case was not ripe for mandamus relief but that a preliminary injunction was necessary due to the exigent nature of the case and the necessity of the school district to operate with public funding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the Control Board's request in quo warranto to remove various members of the Elected Board as well as denied the Control Board's request for a peremptory writ of mandamus. The court granted the Control Board's request for a preliminary injunction and ordered the Elected Board to full its funding obligations by enacting the necessary resolutions regarding the school district's budget. The court retained jurisdiction of the case.</SPAN></P>

One of the men went to the night manager and ordered her to open the cash register, threatening to pull a gun on her. The night manager complied.

While this was occurring, the other robber was taking cigarette cartons. The deli worker testified that one of the men pointed a gun at her cheek. When defendant's car was stopped, numerous one dollar and five dollar bills were found, as were cartons of cigarettes. The trial court found that it correctly determined that sufficient evidence supported the verdict. Surveillance footage and identifications of the witnesses established that defendant and his brother were at the scene of the convenience store at the time of the robbery. When police attempted to stop defendant's vehicle because two people were inside, defendant fled at excessive rates of speed. The items taken from the store were ultimately found in the car.

Based on evidence seized from defendant's home following execution of the warrant, he was charged with sexual abuse of children. Defendant sought suppression and an adjunct writ of habeas corpus. The court noted that the sole issue for consideration was whether the facts contained in the affidavit sufficiently established probable cause to support issuance of the search warrant. A review of the affidavit indicated that connections between various undefined technical terms, the alleged crime, and defendant were not explained. The court concluded that the magistrate either lacked a &quot;substantial basis&quot; for concluding probable cause existed or considered information outside of the affidavit. However, probable cause was not established by the affidavit, such that the search warrant was violative of defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. The court concluded that defendant's home was searched illegally and his property was illegally seized.</SPAN></P>

Counsel was not, however ineffective for failing to raise numerous meritless issues such as the Commonwealth's alleged failure to disclose impeachment evidence concerning promises made to co-defendant where there was no evidence that any such promises were made. Other claims, such as the trial court's alleged error in refusing to allow defense counsel to cross-examine co-defendant on his guilty plea in the case, failed because the inmate could not show that had they not occurred, the outcome of the trial would have been different.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a county and various of its officers, sought dismissal by preliminary objections of complaints filed by plaintiff property owners, which challenged the legality of Allegheny County, Penn., Ordinance 45-05-OR, amending Allegheny County, Penn., Administrative Code art. 210. Defendants claimed that the complaints failed to state grounds for relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An annual reassessment was conducted in 2002, which was certified for use by taxing bodies in the levying of property taxes. As a result of the continued use of 2002 as a base year, the assessed values of properties in the county for 2006 did not take into account changes in market values or sales occurring after 2002. Plaintiffs claimed that Ordinance 45-05-OR was unconstitutional for failing to equalize the 2002 valuations with the present neighborhood and property conditions. There was no violation of the General County Assessment Law and the Second Class County Assessment Law, 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 5020-402(a) and 5452.4, as use of a base year system was permitted. The use of the value determined through the appeal process was consistent with the requirements of 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5452.10, and the Assessment Laws were similarly not violated. The constitutional claims failed due to a lack of specificity, and there was no inconsistency with respect to prior rulings by the court. A challenge to the valuation methods contained in the Ordinance as violative of the Assessment Laws survived dismissal, as the Laws prohibited consideration of factors other than those enumerated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendants' motion to dismiss claims as to alleged violations of the Assessments Laws and regarding the appeal process with respect to the base year system.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">PennDOT had suspended the driver's license after receiving notice from New York that the driver had failed to respond to a citation that had been issued to him and that his driving privileges in New York had been suspended.

However, there was no proof that the driver ever requested andy discovery. At trial, PennDOT submitted certified copies of PennDOT's notice of suspension to the driver, the notice of suspension issued by the State of New York, and the driver's driving record. Applying 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 1533(b) to the facts and evidence presented, the trial court had determined that the driver's appeal should be dismissed and his suspension reinstated. As that decision did not constitute an error of law or a manifest abuse of discretion, the trial court submitted that its order should be affirmed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), defendant appealed his convictions by the court for endangering the welfare of children and corruption of minors in regard to a sexual relationship he had with the victim, a 16-year-old student. Defendant argued, inter alia, that 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6301 was unconstitutional and that the evidence was insufficient as to both charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was seen by several witnesses alone with the victim. The victim testified as to defendant's conduct. The court held the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant engaged in a sexual relationship with the victim at a time when she was both a minor and his student. It was clear that defendant pursued the victim sexually and that he wrote her many notes leading her to believe that he intended to marry her, even after he married another woman. The victim trusted defendant and considered him a confidante. In turn, defendant took advantage of her by initiating a sexual relationship. Defendant had a duty to protect the victim and instead used his influence take advantage of her. The purpose of 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6301 and 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 4303 was to protect children. Defendant neglected his duty for his own selfish pleasure. The court was satisfied that defendant knowingly committed the underlying behavior and, as such, was guilty. The record was devoid of evidence that others in defendant's position were not prosecuted for sexual conduct with students or that the statute allowed for such prosecution. 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6301 had previously been found to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his post-conviction motions. Defendant appealed, alleging, inter alia, that the 10-year look-back provision of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3806 was unconstitutional. Pursuant to Pa. R. App. P. 1925(a), the trial court wrote an opinion in support of the judgment of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer testified that he observed defendant speeding and crossing over the double yellow line three times. Defendant failed to stop for some time after the officer activated his cruiser's overhead lights and siren. He had glossy, bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and an odor of alcohol; he failed field sobriety tests and was arrested. The officer opined, based on his training, experience, and observations, that defendant was under the influence of alcohol. The court found that this evidence was sufficient to support defendant's DUI conviction. Further, the officer's observations that defendant was speeding and driving carelessly or recklessly provided him with probable cause to stop defendant's vehicle. 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3806, which increased the &quot;look-back&quot; period from seven to 10 years for convictions used to enhance the sentence for a DUI conviction, did not violate the ex post facto provisions of U.S. Const. art.

The contention that 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3806(b) violated the Due Process Clause had been considered and rejected by an appellate court.</SPAN></P>

The charges against the owner were dropped and she went to the shelter to check on her dogs. The owner was advised that her dogs had been put to sleep two days prior. However, the dogs were not actually put to sleep until three days later. The court issued an opinion supporting the verdict in favor of the owner. The court noted that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find negligence, conversion, and a violation of the owner's civil right to have her dogs returned to her. The court determined that an instruction regarding 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 5511(j) was appropriate because although the charges were dropped, that is why the owner was arrested and the dogs were seized. The court noted that the humane society was not entitled to sovereign immunity. The court found that it properly denied the humane society's motion to dismiss the owner's common law claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered an opinion on appeal under Pa. R. App. P. 1925(a) to explain its denial of post-verdict motions by defendants, a real estate company and a seller, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on a jury award for plaintiff buyer on fraud. The buyer challenged denial of an award for treble damages under the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (PUTPCPL), 73 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 201-9.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer's action was based on nondisclosure of a lien on common property (CP) adjoining the condo she bought. The evidence supported the jury's finding that both the company and the seller committed fraud. The buyer clearly inquired about the status of the CP at closing, they did not disclose the lien and possible sheriff's sale, and the buyer's purchase was clearly contingent on access to the CP. Fraudulent misrepresentation, detrimental reliance, and proximate cause on damages were established. The buyer proved that she expended legal expenses directly related to enforcing her easement in the CP. The evidence was also sufficient for the jury to find that, despite the easement, the sheriff's sale resulted in a compensable loss of the buyer's use and enjoyment of the property. Expert testimony was not required on that issue. Though attorney fees and costs were warranted, treble damages under the PUTPCPL, 73 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 201-9.2, were not. Since they genuinely, though mistakenly, believed the lien on the CP would be cleared up quickly, the company and seller did not intend that the buyer would incur any losses as a result of the fraud.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he was discovered swimming naked in a quarry with three young males, ages 13, 15 and 18. It was noted that defendant had set up a digital camera to photograph himself and the others. Search warrants executed on defendant's vehicle, his computer, and his residence yielded many more photographs of naked men and boys. The court denied defendant's suppression motion and he was convicted of multiple offenses. The court imposed sentence, and defendant filed a notice of appeal. The court submitted an opinion under Pa. R. App. P. 1925(a) in support of an affirmance of its decision. It noted that suppression was not proper in the circumstances, as there was sufficient supportive facts and probable cause within the four corners of the warrants to support their issuance. The convictions were based on sufficient evidence to support each offense. Issues relating to the weight of the evidence were not preserved for review where a new trial motion was not made, but there was no merit to the claim because the Commonwealth's evidence was abundant. The sentences imposed were well within the statutory range and were supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The worker offered a remittitur to $ 1,750,000, which was accepted by the court in its judgment. The manufacturers filed separate appeals and the court entered an opinion addressing both appeals. The court found that the worker timely filed the complaint within the limitation period from when the worker suffered a compensable injury. Her [resented sufficient evidence to show asbestosis by showing his exposure to the manufacturers' product, which contained asbestos dust that he worker breathed. He also showed exposure before the manufacturer began placing warning labels on the product, so strict liability due to an inherently dangerous product was properly charged to the jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners were the owners of 11 acres of property at a specific location. One summer, they received several truckloads of free dirt from a contractor doing excavation work at a construction site.

The code enforcement officer informed them that they had to obtain a grading permit for the dirt being dumped on their property. Eventually, the landowners filed an appeal of the order with the township code hearing board. The township code hearing board held a hearing on the matter and denied the appeal. The landowners appealed. The trial court denied the appeal, and the landowners appealed that ruling. The trial court found that the landowners were not exempt from having to obtain the required permit since the landowners were involved in the activity of &quot;grading,&quot; and not in the permit-exempt activity of &quot;farming,&quot; the composition of the township code hearing board was proper, and the Pennsylvania Right to Farm Act, 3 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of sentence from the trial court (Pennsylvania), which convicted defendant of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, sexual assault, corruption of minors, two charges of indecent assault, and obscene and other sexual materials. Defendant was found a Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9795.1 and was sentenced to 9 1/2 to 22 years incarceration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions arose from the brutal sexual assault of an unconscious 17-year-old girl that he drugged. Defendant was alleged to have inserted various objects into the victim's vagina while she was unconscious, including a shot glass, vodka bottle, candle, light bulb, and hanger, while in a room full of people. The court first addressed the blatant violation of Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), with regard to defendant filing a 36-page document containing 150 matters complained of. The court found such a number of claims frivolous. Addressing the evidence in the case, the court found that the same overwhelmingly established that defendant preyed on the victim by having her come to a party at his house when she was already intoxicated, drugged her by giving her a cup of orange juice with a date rape drug, and then sexually assaulting her, later destroying a videotape he made of his actions. The court stressed that the victim was unconscious, as evidenced by her own testimony and that of eyewitnesses, and, therefore, never consented to the sexual acts. The court further upheld the finding that defendant was a SVP as an expert testified that defendant clearly met the statutory definition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court strongly urged defendant and/or his counsel to be sanctioned for their blatant violation of the appellate rules of procedure by raising frivolous claims on appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court (Pennsylvania) reversed a decision of a zoning board of adjustment (ZBA) that had granted variances to appellant owners. The variances were to allow the first floor of the owners' property to be used as a convenience store, which was a use prohibited in the &quot;Rittenhouse Overlay.&quot; Appellees objected to the owners' proposed use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' property was located in and subject to zoning for the central city commercial area under Philadelphia, Pa., Zoning Code &sect;&sect; 14-607, 14-607.1 and also the three-month-old &quot;Rittenhouse Overlay&quot; under Philadelphia, Pa., Zoning Code &sect; 14-1670.1. The &quot;Rittenhouse Overlay&quot; was located within the central city commercial area. The &quot;Rittenhouse Overlay&quot; was properly determined not to be unconstitutional. Not just the instant owners, but all owners that were located in both districts were subject to the zoning requirements of both districts. Therefore, in addition to the owners not producing sufficient evidence to the ZBA to sustain a constitutional challenge of either district, the trial court found that the districts' zoning codes were not facially unreasonable, arbitrary, or exclusionary so as to cause them to be prejudicial to the owners and to be unconstitutional as applied to the owners. Procedurally, all owners in both districts had the right to appeal to the ZBA a denial of the required use certificates. The owners failed to provide to the ZBA evidence that their hardship was not self-imposed and that the proposed use was not contrary to the public interest.</SPAN></P>

The licensee's appeal was sustained. The licensee's nunc pro tunc appeal of his license suspension was warranted due to the breakdown in PennDOT's administrative process, which manifested itself in PennDOT's requirement that the licensee obtain the ignition interlock where its prior letter setting out what the licensee had to do to obtain a restoration of his driving privileges made no mention of such an interlock.

While the title of &sect; 3802 was &quot;Driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance,&quot; &sect; 3802(a)(2) did not require the Commonwealth to prove a bright line standard of .08 percent or higher at the time of the operation of a motor vehicle. The state's high court had previously held that the predecessor to &sect; 3802(a)(2), 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3731(a)(5), was unconstitutional because it attempted to proscribe both lawful and unlawful conduct. As the import of the language in 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802(a)(2) was no different than that of 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3731(a)(5), the former, like the latter, was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to charges of indecent assault and corruption of minors. The charges had stemmed from indecent contact with a girl, who at the time was under the age of 13. The Commonwealth indicated its interest in having defendant classified as a Sexually Violent Predator (SVP). Thereafter, defendant was sentenced. The trial court then held a hearing to determine whether he should be classified as an SVP. Defendant filed a pre-hearing motion in limine seeking the exclusion of any opinions from the Commonwealth's expert, a psychologist with the Sexual Offenders Assessment Board, seeking the exclusion of any opinions from him which were based upon &quot;unproven allegations&quot; contained in a probable cause affidavit or other law enforcement documents, particularly to the effect that defendant threatened the victim or that he molested a second victim. The motion was taken under advisement. The expert then testified to several factors set forth in Megan's Law, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9791 et seq., that led him to conclude defendant was an SVP. The trial court found that the motion in limine should be granted, but that clear and convincing evidence showed that defendant was an SVP.</SPAN></P>

The mother filed a praecipe for court argument, alleging that 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5312 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that 23 Pa.C.S. &sect;5312 violated the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. 14, where the statute clearly created a classification for parents that were separated or divorced, interfered with those parents' fundamental right to determine with whom their children associated, and there was no compelling governmental interest that justified the intervention and classification. Specifically, the court did not see that a compelling governmental interest existed to treat separated parents, who were both still alive and still fit to make decisions regarding their children, any differently that two parents who were still together. Although the parents were not together, it did not logically follow that state intervention was necessary. Both parents remained and, during periods of their partial custody with the children, either parent could provide access to their parents. There was no compelling reason for the mother to give up more of her time with the children so that the father's parents could have their own periods of visitation separate from visitations while the father had custody.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered an order finding that the statute allowing grandparents to petition for custody and visitation of grandchildren when the parents were separated for six months or more violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Cons. Stat. &sect; 3802(c), defendant filed an omnibus pretrial motion that challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 3802(c) and that her statements to a trooper without having been advised of her Miranda rights should be suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's pretrial motion alleged that 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3802(c) was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad, had no rational relationship to a state interest, and imposed absolute liability without an affirmative defense or a rebuttable presumption. The court found that drunk driving laws were clearly related to a compelling state interest in preventing drunk driving. Moreover, there was no protected right to drink alcohol, so the statute could not be overbroad and the statute created only one offense, so what was prohibited by the statute was not vague. It was also not necessary to define with mathematical precision what was prohibited by the statute. Finally, &sect; 3802(c) did not presume a specific blood alcohol content (BAC) level that the defendant had to then rebut and defendant was free to challenge, through evidentiary challenges at trial, the accuracy of the BAC testing or whether she was drunk, In short, the statute was constitutional. As to defendant's motion to suppress statements made at her daughter's house to police, defendant was not in custody for driving drunk until after she made the statements to police, so Miranda was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

A police officer arrived at the scene about five minutes after the collision. Because defendant appeared intoxicated and failed a field sobriety test, the officer transported him to a hospital for a blood test to determine his blood alcohol content (BAC). The test, which was completed about one hour and 20 minutes after the accident, showed that defendant had a BAC of 0.18 percent. Defendant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of, inter alia, 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3802(c). He filed a motion to declare that statutory section unconstitutional because it did not require proof of BAC at the time of driving. Accordingly, the statute was vague and overbroad, he contended. The trial court denied his motion. It pointed out that under the statute the Commonwealth did not have to prove BAC at the actual time of driving, but, instead only had to prove it within two hours of driving. The trial court then found that provision was not vague or overbroad, but was rationally related to the Commonwealth's interest in keeping its highways safe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had pled guilty to driving under the influence on two prior occasions, in July 1996 and December 1998. On appeal, defendant alleged that the trial court erroneously sentenced defendant as a third time offender. Defendant claimed that the &quot;new&quot; DUI legislation increased the penalty attached to a prior conviction that was between seven and 10 years old by including it within the category of prior offenses that would trigger increased punishment. The common pleas court found no error, noting that the enactment of 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 3731(e)(1) did not make criminal an action which had previously been lawful and did not alter the rules of evidence to require less or different testimony in order to convict; the legislation only expanded the period within which a prior conviction would be considered. In the alternative, defendant alleged that, in enacting the new legislation, the legislature did not intend that the current law be applied &quot;retroactively.&quot; The court noted that only those offenders who committed violations after the effective date were subject to its provisions and that its application did not run afoul of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his conviction on guilty plea of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and related offenses, petitioner offender was adjudicated a sexually violent predator (SVP) under Megan's Law II, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9791 et seq. In a post-trial motion, he challenged the adjudication, arguing that the law's failure to provide judicial review made the punishment excessive and denied due process, and that the law was also unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An earlier version of the law, Megan's Law I, had contained a provision for relief from SVP status where an offender could establish cure or at least that he no longer posed a substantial threat of re-offending, but Megan's Law II contained no such provision. The other arguably meritorious issue raised by the offender was that the measures of likelihood of re-offending recognized under the statute were not really the best predictors of future behavior. The offender had not, however, presented sufficient expert evidence to carry his substantial burden of showing unconstitutionality. Pennsylvania case law had already settled the offender's other challenges by finding that the law was remedial rather than punitive, so that lifetime classification was not unduly punitive nor a denial of due process and that the terms used in the statute were perfectly clear, so as to provide adequate notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record indicated that a private delivery company had provided notice of the arbitration to the cardholder and that the cardholder had not appeared at the arbitration. The issuer had not previously instituted proceedings to compel arbitration under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7304(a) so that the issue of whether there had been an agreement to arbitrate had not been adjudicated. The court held that in a proceeding to confirm either a statutory arbitration award, pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7313, or a common law arbitration award, pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7342, confirmation would not be proper if the arbitrator had lacked jurisdiction and there was no jurisdiction in the absence of an order compelling arbitration. The policy underlying arbitration was to relieve court congestion, but when used as the issuer was attempting to use it, the confirmation process became in effect a default judgment proceeding, which would require greater, not less, court involvement than a conventional proceeding on motion to compel arbitration. The issuer was required to follow the statutory process with confirmation only available if arbitration had been authorized by an order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found that the husband's injuries were caused by his exposure to asbestos and that the corporation was 30% liable for the injuries. Plaintiffs filed a motion for post-trial relief, seeking a new trial, or a molded verdict, or additur, and the corporation filed a motion for post-trial relief, seeking judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The court denied the parties' post-trial motions. The court affirmed the judgment. The court determined that the scope of cross-examination was within the sound discretion of the trial judge. The court explained that the wife's salary was relevant to both her consortium claim as well as her husband's retirement plans. The court noted that the verdict clearly had a reasonable relationship to the evidence, and was not so inadequate as to warrant a new trial. The court concluded that the three subjects contained in the Comparative Negligence Act, 42 Pa. C.S.A. &sect; 7102 all pertained to the courts and were all contained in the same Title of Purdons. The court determined that plaintiffs did not object to including another corporation on the verdict sheet, nor did they make any motions concerning that corporation, so they waived the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student alleged that while he was retrieving items from his locker, he was injured by another student.

The common pleas court initially granted the school's motion for summary judgment because none of the exceptions in 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8542 were applicable to the student's theory of negligence. The student then filed a motion requesting certification of the order, pursuant to Pa. R. App. P. 341(c), contending, inter alia, that any legislative attempt to grant the charter school immunity was unconstitutional. The court found that the student had not met his burden of persuasion in questioning the constitutionality of the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8541 et seq. Therefore, because the legislative immunity referred to in 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-1714-A(a)(2) was constitutional, pursuant to Pa. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was previously convicted of multiple sexual offenses. At the time of sentencing, the trial court, at defendant's request, denied the Commonwealth's request that defendant undergo assessment by the Board, holding Pennsylvania Megan's Law II unconstitutional. After a reviewing court remanded that decision, the trial court then issued a rule to show cause why defendant should not undergo mandatory assessment by the Board. Defendant argued that the sexually violent predator provisions could not be applied retroactively to him. According to 2000 Pa. Laws 74, the Law applied to individuals convicted after its effective date. Defendant was convicted after the effective date. Defendant argued that he could not be referred to the Board because the steps specified under 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9795.3, 9795.4 had not been followed since defendant had not been assessed by the Board prior to sentencing. At the time that defendant was sentenced for the first and second times in the case, the trial court's decision holding the Law unconstitutional was being appealed and was still in effect.

The city contended that it was entitled to immunity under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act. The court concluded that the citizen was entitled to seek a civil remedy for the alleged violation of his state constitutional rights. The court noted that Pa. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation claimed that under 72 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5566b and a decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania which declared taxation of oil and gas interests improper, it was entitled to refunds on prior taxes paid on those interests. The issue was whether the decision applied retroactively. The court found that, applying the three-pronged Chevron analysis, prospective application only was appropriate. The decision announced a new principle of law and the relief was forward-looking. Retroactive operation of the new &quot;rule&quot; would have deprived the political subdivisions of the revenues not only counted on by those political subdivisions but also of those already disbursed in providing services to taxpayers and citizens. An examination of the equities conclusively indicated that the decision should have been applied prospectively. A retroactive application would have effected titles to oil, gas, and mineral interests in the affected counties. Not only would the titles to those interests have been thrown into chaos, the purchasers at tax sales would have been deprived of their titles to their purchased interests, and would have sought restitution from the taxing authorities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow, suing as executrix and in her own right, filed a statement of issues for appeal after a nonsuit was granted in favor of defendant physician in the widow's medical malpractice action alleging negligence in the physician's treatment of her husband. She challenged the failure to qualify her proposed expert pursuant to Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 40, &sect; 1303.512 as well as the nonsuit ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow believed that the physician's failure to perform more extensive tests on her husband, as warranted by a family history of cancer and specific symptoms, led to the failure to detect his fatal cancer. The expert she attempted to present at trial remained active in teaching, but more than five years had passed since he had practiced or taught in the particular subspecialty in question. The court held, therefore, that he was not qualified under the plain language of &sect; 1303.512, which commenced the five-year countback from the time of trial, not the malpractice. Furthermore, the statute was constitutional. The legislature's involvement in establishing rules of evidence, which the provision in question clearly was, was recognized under Pennsylvania constitutional law. Also, because no suspect class or noneconomic right was involved, the provision passed muster under equal protection and substantive due process principles since it bore a rational relationship to the accomplishment of the legislature's goals of enabling patients and their survivors to recover for medical malpractice while trying to keep medical malpractice insurance affordable for health care providers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff students filed a class action against defendant school district alleging that 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-2134 was unconstitutional. The students were previously adjudicated delinquent pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6341 and faced alternative educational placement under 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-2134 when they sought to return to regular public school programs after successful completion of a residential placement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After attending a transition center, students were assigned to an alternative education program for disruptive students or a nontraditional program. The court determined that the Transition Statute,&nbsp;24 Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-2134, was constitutional. The legislature was specifically allowed by Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 20 to make classifications based upon population. The Transition Statute was not special or local legislation in violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32 because it was uniform in its treatment of class members. The statute survived an equal protection analysis because the legislature had a legitimate state interest in ensuring that students returning from placement and those in a regular school program received an education without the fear of disruption or violence. The challenges and difficulties facing larger school districts warranted separate treatment. The students' reputations suffered a deprivation when they were adjudicated delinquent, at which time they received due process protections. The court found that the Transition Statute and the assignment of the students to an alternate education setting did not inflict a separate and distinct harm to their reputations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the school district's cross-motion for summary judgment and its preliminary objections and dismissed the students' amended complaint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought a motion to dismiss after the Commonwealth charged him with two counts of violating Megan's Law II, specifically 42 Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that 42 Pa. C.S. &sect; 9795.2(d)(1), which provided that his failure to register as required by &sect;&sect; 9795.1(a)(1) and (2) constituted a felony, was unconstitutionally punitive. The court agreed and granted defendant's motion. Although the Commonwealth argued that defendant's motion was not timely as required by Pa. R. Crim. P. 579, the court found it timely pursuant to the exception contained in Rule 579. The court explained that defendant filed his motion within two weeks after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held 42 Pa. C.S. &sect; 9795.2(d)(2), which was the penalty clause for sexually violent predators, to be unconstitutional. The court explained that the intent of the General Assembly in enacting Megan's Law II was not to punish but to promote public safety through a civil, regulatory scheme, and that the registration requirements imposed by the law were not unconstitutionally punitive. The court concluded, however, that &sect;&sect; 9795.2(d)(1) and (2), which allowed for incarceration, including a possible lifetime term, were manifestly in excess of what was needed to insure compliance with the Law's registration requirements.</SPAN></P>

P. 1006(a.1), from Philadelphia County, which was where the patient's injury manifested itself, to Montgomery County, which was where all the alleged acts of medical malpractice occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In her complaint, the patient alleged that the medical provider's failure to properly interpret a positive urine culture and laboratory test results that revealed the presence of staphylococcus aureus caused her alleged injuries. The court affirmed its earlier decision that venue was improper in Philadelphia County because all the alleged acts of medical malpractice occurred in Montgomery County. The patient's injury occurred simultaneously with the alleged acts of malpractice. The only connection to Philadelphia County was that it was the county in which plaintiff's injury manifested itself when she was admitted into an emergency room in Philadelphia County two days after the alleged misdiagnosis in Philadelphia County. The patient's injury began to accrue at the time the medical provider allegedly failed to prescribe the proper treatment. Thus, the motion to transfer venue to Montgomery County was properly granted under the newly amended Pa. R. Civ. P. 1006(a.1) providing that a medical professional liability action may be brought against a health care provider for a medical professional liability claim only in a county in which the cause of action arose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Second Class Township Code (Code), 53 P.S. &sect; 65503, the resident filed a petition, along with an affidavit containing signatures of five percent of the electors of the township, seeking removal of the township supervisor for failure to perform the duties of the office, specifically listing 14 instances of dereliction of duty. The court held that the provision of the Code authorizing the removal of township officers was in violation of Pa. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7, which was the exclusive means of removing elected officials. Under art. VI, &sect; 7, there were only three kinds of removal and the constitution could not be interpreted as allowing any legislatively created concurrent or alternative method of removal. The first clause of Article VI, &sect; 7, combined with &sect; 503 of the Code, did not allow for removal of elected officials absent a conviction. Under the plain language of the constitutional provision, the clause could not be read, as contended by the resident, as allowing removal for misbehavior in office without a conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9728(b)(5) vested in the department of corrections the drafting of guidelines for the collections of fines, costs, and restitution from state incarcerated inmates. Those guidelines recognized an inmate's right to a certain minimal balance in his account. The guideline amount was patterned after other legislation and provided the minimal protection to which an inmate was entitled. A court determined all restitution, fines, and costs after a hearing. If the inmate still had a legitimate right to be asserted, the best vehicle for asserting such claim was through the existing prison grievance procedures and not through a court hearing in a venue outside the institution. The legislature did not provide for a right to a hearing concerning the deductions, and it did not create any property rights in prison employment or earnings. Such matters were best left to the sound discretion of correctional authorities.</SPAN></P>

Any concern that &sect; 7512 could be interpreted to include use of a phone or other communication facility that had the unanticipated consequence of facilitating the commission or attempted commission of a felony was relieved by the scienter requirement whereby in order for a conviction to stand, defendants had to be found to have intentionally or knowingly caused or facilitated the commission of the felony or the attempt to commit the felony through the use of the phone. A strong presumption existed that duly enacted laws were constitutional. Defendants had the burden of proving unconstitutionality.

The court found defendant not guilty after concluding that the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant transported any food product or produce intended for human consumption, explaining that there was a question as to whether raw, unprocessed red wheat number two was &quot;any food product or produce intended for human consumption&quot; as defined in &sect; 4909(a)(1). The court noted that the Commonwealth had the never shifting burden of proving all elements of a charged offense. The court declined to rule &sect; 4909(a)(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional, noting that it was not absolutely necessary in order to decide the instant case.

At issue was 15 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1929.1, which limited asbestos-related liabilities to certain mergers or consolidations. The company argued that it was entitled to relief under the legislation as the maximum damages it might have had to pay under successor liability principles had been exceeded and it was no longer liable for additional damages. Answering, the various plaintiffs raised arguments that the legislation violated various provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the United States Constitution and other arguments regarding the motion's defects. In granting summary judgment to the company, the court rejected plaintiffs' arguments. The legislation did not violate the Federal Commerce Clause or Equal Protection because the legislation did not &quot;on its face&quot; burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce nor was the tort action an article of commerce. Further, plaintiffs failed the test for standing to raise the issue of the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 378 consolidated cases, plaintiffs filed mass tort actions against defendants, the mining companies, manufacturers, distributors, installers, retailers, sellers, contractors, insurers, and their successors, to recover damages on asbestos-related claims. Defendant domestic successor corporation moved for summary judgment to limit its successor liability under 15 Pa. C.S. &sect; 1929.1. Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 1929.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The successor purchased a bottle cap manufacturer. As part of the purchase, the successor acquired and closed the manufacturer's asbestos installation business. It also incurred successor liability to the manufacturer's tortious activities in operating its asbestos business and sought to limit its liability under &sect; 1929.1. Plaintiffs argued that &sect; 1929.1 was unconstitutional. The court granted the successor's motion for summary judgment. Section 1929.1 did not violate the federal Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses because it was not facially discriminatory when it made no distinction between domestic and foreign companies for the purpose of exposing the successor's assets to liability and any increased liability burden was shared by domestic and foreign companies alike. Section 1929.1 did not violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 18's prohibition against limiting personal injury damages because plaintiffs' recovery was not diminished when all defendants were subject to joint tort liability. Section 1929.1 did not violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 32's prohibition against the passage of special laws because it applied to a class of domestic corporations with successor liability.</SPAN></P>

The partners then formed a corporation in Pennsylvania, and the corporation and the agent contracted for the corporation to send the agent all its tomato output for sale. The agent brought an action against the corporation and the partners, individually, for breach of the contract. The partners claimed that jurisdiction over them could not be obtained. The court held that although the partners' actions did not establish general jurisdiction under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 5301-5329, they qualified for specific or transactional jurisdiction. Because the partners solicited the services of the agent, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5322(a)(1)(i) conferred jurisdiction. Application of the long-arm statute did not offend the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Sufficient contacts existed to confer jurisdiction to comport with fair play and substantial justice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking to have the drug delivery resulting in death charge dismissed. Defendant contended that 18 Pa. Cons.

The court held that the second ordinance was inconsistent with the first ordinance, and because it was later in time, it had to be construed as modifying the first ordinance. The main issue in the case was whether the legislative body of the county could replace an assessment that was certified with existing law with an assessment that it subsequently created. The court held that the county council lacked the authority to substitute an assessment which it found to be more equitable. The court also determined that the ordinances adopted violated previously enacted laws. Therefore, the original assessment was the official assessment of the county for 2002. The court further determined that there was nothing inconsistent with a countywide reassessment every three years. Finally, the court entered its order regarding the assessment.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that condemnation procedures were legislatively granted, and no condemnation could be a violation of due process guarantees under either the Federal or State Constitutions. Therefore, judicial review of municipal action was restricted to abuse of discretion analysis. The court noted that the city was guided by the provisions of Pa. Stat. Ann. &sect; 406 et seq., the Eminent Domain Code, in taking private property for public use. The court concluded that the taking was constitutionally permissible, however, the motion to strike was granted as to the amended taking declaration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appealed from an order entered by the court on defendant's motion for extraordinary relief, which declared that the &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; provisions of the Registration of Sexual Offenders Act, (Megan's Law II), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9791 et seq., were unconstitutional, and therefore could not be applied to defendant, who was identified by the Sexual Offenders Assessment Board as a sexually violent predator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to indecent assault, two counts of corrupting morals of children, and one count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Defendant was identified by the Sexual Offenders Assessment Board as a sexually violent predator, which made him subject to the notification and lifetime counseling requirements under Megan's Law II. Thereafter, the court, upon defendant's motion for extraordinary relief challenging the constitutionality of Megan's Law II, declared that the &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; provisions of the Act were unconstitutional. On the Commonwealth's appeal, the court determined that the notification and lifetime counseling provisions of the Act constituted enhanced punishment. The court also ruled that defendant's right to due process of law was violated because the Commonwealth was only required to prove that defendant was a sexually violent predator by clear and convincing proof, rather than by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that the &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; provisions were not reasonably related to a non-punitive and legitimate legislative purpose, and therefore constituted enhanced punishment, and were thus unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; provisions of Megan's Law II were unconstitutional, and dismissed all other claims for extraordinary relief as moot.</SPAN></P>

Appellee taxing bodies alleged that the land was not exempt under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5020-204(a)(3) and that the religious property exemption was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Board denied a corporation's application for a tax exemption, the corporation filed an appeal to the court for a non-jury trial on the affidavits and depositions. The court held that because Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 375(f)(5) of the Pennsylvania Institutions of Purely Public Charity Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit.10, &sect; 371 et seq., stated that an institution satisfied its criterion of relieving the government of some of its burden by promoting religion, and because the taxing bodies conceded that the corporation met all the other criterion of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &sect; 375, the land was exempt under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5020-204(a)(3) of the Pennsylvania General County Assessment Law. Because the taxing bodies were instrumentalities of the State and derived their power from the State, the taxing bodies had no standing under U.S. Const. amend. XIV to challenge Pa. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After having been convicted in the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania) of five counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and three counts of corruption of minors, defendant challenged the constitutionality of 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9798, 9799.4, which were, respectively, the notification provisions and requirement of lifetime monthly counseling at defendant's expense in Megan's Law II, 42 Pa. Cons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered the issues in the context of a United States Supreme Court ruling as to whether certain sanctions could be imposed on defendant without violating procedural due process. The court applied the three-prong test in Artway v. Attorney General of New Jersey/E.B. v. Verniero, which was used in New Jersey to determine the constitutionality of the original Megan's Law, which test had been adopted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The court held that, under the first prong, the notification and counseling provisions related to a legitimate legislative purpose; however, under the second prong, neither provision had an objective purpose that was reasonably related to a non-punitive and legitimate legislative goal. Unlimited public notification of defendant's personal information could only be viewed as punitive. Similarly, there were no limitations on the lifetime counseling provision and no opportunity for review or termination. Under the third prong, the effects of the counseling requirement would likely constitute impermissible punishment, but the effects of notification would not, although they would likely be so considered under the Pennsylvania Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted defendant's petition to preclude imposition of sanctions under Megan's Law II.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 3125, and related offenses, and after a sexually violent predator hearing was scheduled pursuant to 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9795.4, defendant filed a motion for extraordinary relief to challenge the constitutionality of the sexually violent predator provisions of Pennsylvania's Megan's Law II (Act), 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 9791 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After noting that an earlier version of the Act had been held to deny procedural due process, the court reviewed in detail various provisions of the Act. The court pointed out that in amending Megan's Law I, the legislature had eliminated a provision that allowed a sexually violent predator to petition for reconsideration of his assessment. The court agreed with defendant that the effects of the notification and lifetime counseling provisions of the Act constituted punishment, which entitled defendant to the full due process rights afforded by the federal and state constitutions. Given the interests of defendant and the impact of an erroneous decision, the court ruled that the Commonwealth had to prove that an offender was a sexually violent predator beyond a reasonable doubt; however, because the stated legislative purpose in enacting the registration sections of the Act was regulatory and non-punitive and that registration was a legitimate and necessary means to achieving a regulatory goal and was not punishment, the ex post facto and double jeopardy provisions of the federal and state constitutions were not implicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered and decreed that the sexually violent predator notification provisions of Megan's Law II were unconstitutional. The court further ordered and decreed that the registration provisions of Megan's Law II did not violate the double jeopardy or ex post facto clauses of either the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit between plaintiff corporation and defendant corporation, plaintiff, relying on a foreign judgment, filed a praecipe under Pa. R. Civ. P. 3101 and secured a writ of execution against a third corporation. The writ was served on a garnishee pursuant to Pa. R. Civ. P. 3108(4), and the third corporation filed an emergency petition for a temporary restraining order to vacate the judgment and dissolve the writ as to a non-judgment debtor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff obtained the writ and seized the property without prior notice or a hearing. The third corporation, which was not a party, argued that the garnishment procedure violated Fourteenth Amendment due process. The court agreed, explaining that Fourteenth Amendment due process attached in state court actions when a private party was allowed to take another's property. Due process controlled when a state had a system allowing state officials to attach property on the ex parte application of one party to a private dispute. The court ruled that plaintiff had become a state actor in the garnishment proceeding, that the proceeding was thus subject to the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the proceeding had violated that Amendment. Further, a balancing test had to be used to identify the proper procedure, which test included a consideration of the private interest, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest, and the state's interest. Finally, the court described the procedures that a federal court had suggested would satisfy due process and pointed out that a federal court had already held that as to a non-party's property, the garnishment procedure was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dissolved the writ of execution and set it aside.</SPAN></P>

The court pointed out that the language of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 6906, indicated that the legislature did not intend for an imposed tax to fall squarely on the shoulders of one taxpayer. For the same reason, the court found that the tax imposed by the school district was invalid because it violated the State Uniformity Standards under Pa. Const. art.

P. 227.1, including a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, a motion for a new trial, a motion for remittitur, and a motion for leave to supplement the record after a default judgment was entered against it in plaintiff insured's action alleging that the insurer breached the parties' insurance contract and acted in bad faith.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer contended that it was error for the court to apply Pennsylvania rather than Virginia law, and that it was error for the court to assess punitive damages and interest. The court denied the insurer's motions, finding no errors. The court noted that the insurer's choice of law argument was waived because at no time prior to or during the hearing did it raise the issue. The court explained that Pa. R. Civ. P. 1032 stated that a party waived all defenses and objections, except for a few that were not applicable to the instant action, that were not presented either by preliminary objections, answer, or reply. The court found that the insurer's bad faith, which included the conscious disregard of the advice of its counsel and the provision of incentives for bad faith behavior from its handlers, was the exact type of reprehensible contact contemplated by the bad faith statute,&nbsp;42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 8371; thus, the court found no error in the assessment of punitive damages, stating that the only limitation on the amount of punitive damages that could be awarded was that the award could not be excessive.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the Ignition Interlock Law, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7000 et seq. The court found that although the statute was clearly enacted to promote a legitimate state interest, it did treat different classes of people differently and that such disparate treatment could not be reasonably related to any legitimate state interest. The court noted that lessees of vehicles were treated much differently than owners of vehicles. The court also found that under the statute a non-supervised offender who did not own a vehicle would not be able to obtain an ignition interlock restricted license because 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 7003 precluded non-owners of cars from obtaining ignition interlock licenses. Thus, non-owners would not be able to drive for one year even if they were willing to install an interlock on vehicles they routinely operated. The court found the requirement that the offender actually own a vehicle and that every vehicle owned by the offender be equipped with the device was arbitrary, unreasonable and, therefore, unconstitutional. The court found that the Ignition Interlock Law violated the doctrine of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to modify his sentence, arguing that 2000 Pa. Laws 63, which required the installation of the ignition lock on his cars, was unconstitutional. The court held that suspending the licenses of persons convicted of driving under the influence was a legitimate state interest; however, Act 63 treated offenders differently based upon the number of vehicles owned by each, and thus, created an arbitrary classification that did not bear a fair and substantial relationship to the object of the legislation. Legislation that prohibited an offender from operating a vehicle equipped with the ignition interlock device unless every vehicle he owned was also equipped with the device was neither reasonable nor did it bear a rational relationship to the ultimate goal of the legislation. Act 63 required the trial court to determine defendant's eligibility for a restricted license based on the installation of the ignition locks, but there was no mechanism for defendant to seek a certification from the court that an ignition interlock system had been installed on each motor vehicle owned. Nor was there a mechanism for defendant to challenge entitlement to a certification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vice-president was married to the mother. At the president's request, the vice-president borrowed funds from the son's trust account to meet the corporation's payroll and expenses and executed three promissory notes that included confession of judgment clauses. The president was the corporation's sole stockholder and gave the vice-president authority, under a power of attorney, to execute any agreements and to endorse any instruments for the corporation. After filing for a divorce, the mother filed the confessed judgments on the notes. The corporation petitioned to strike off or open the confessed judgments, contending that it did not knowingly and voluntarily waive its rights and that the notes were ambiguous and unenforceable. The court denied the petitions. The corporation was not entitled to strike off or open the confessed judgments on the defense that it did not waive its rights because confessed judgment clauses were constitutional, the vice-president had authority to execute the notes and bind the corporation, and the corporation benefited from the notes. The notes were not ambiguous for failing to state the when payments were due because the notes were demand notes.</SPAN></P>

The guarantor executed a commercial guaranty. The court denied the petition. The court determined that the bank's attempted execution was invalid because Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 2956.1(c)(2)(i) prohibited execution on a confessed judgment until at least thirty days after a defendant was served with judgment notice in accordance with Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 2958(1). The court explained that the complaint listed the principal balance due, the interest due, and attorney's fees, which complied with Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 2952(a)(7). The court noted that the practice of allowing the entry of judgment by confession was not unconstitutional. The court concluded that the guarantor presented nothing to show that he did not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waive his rights to challenge the amount of the judgment. The court determined that the main purpose of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act was to promote the availability of credit to all creditworthy applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A land developer owned property located in an area rezoned as an agricultural preservation (AP) zoning district. This district, which covered about 90 percent of a township, restricted development by preserving agricultural land, and also limited the size of lots to &quot;one good acre,&quot; with a minimum building envelope of 10,000 square feet. &quot;One good acre&quot; was defined as one acre free of watercourses, floodplains, floodplain soils, wetlands, lakes, or ponds. The court held that (1) zoning to preserve agricultural land was allowed under the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10101 et seq.; (2) the township's AP zone reflected goals contained in the township's comprehensive plan, and was a valid exercise of the township's police power; (3) the requirement that homes be developed on one good acre did not require development on more than two acres, such that Pennsylvania's rule requiring municipalities to provide extraordinary justification when adopting ordinances limiting lot sizes to over two acres was triggered; and (4) the zoning hearing board had not committed an error of law, or abused its discretion by upholding the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff failed to produce a single shred of evidence regarding present population and projected future population growth, level of development or other relevant factors. Indeed, plaintiff failed to produce evidence to establish a need for the proposed facility.

The court held that the provisions allowing regulations for the protection of wildlife were a valid exercise of police power and not unconstitutional, but only to the extent that the provisions were not applied so as to deny any property owner the right to offer the defense of justification in the protection of his property. Therefore the court ordered that the matter proceed to trial, allowing defendant to advance that defense.</SPAN></P>

The prohibition on killing of wildlife was not intended to strip all property owners other than farmers of their inherent right to protect their property.</SPAN></P>
