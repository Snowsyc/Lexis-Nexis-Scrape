<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court had initially granted summary judgment to the employees, after a bench trial. The appellate court had reversed those judgments, finding that there existed a factual issue as to whether the employees were on call or subject to call employees.

Ann. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;337.020 to 337.405 were subject to have been decided by the commissioner was removed. As such, nothing in the language of Ky. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant coal company was granted discretionary review of a decision from the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which affirmed an assessment of a 10 percent penalty pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26A.300 as additional damages on a judgment appellee construction companies were awarded on their claims of fraudulent inducement and wrongful breach of a coal lease contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The coal company stayed enforcement of an adverse judgment posting a supersedeas bond. The court denied its motion for discretionary review. That denial further delayed enforcement of the judgment, so a penalty under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26A.300 equal to 10 percent of the judgment was ordered. On appeal, the coal company challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 26A.300. The court found that the penalty, when applicable, was automatic and mandatory. However, the penalty applied only to unsuccessful appellants in second appeals from superseded money judgments. Therefore, the statute treated unsuccessful appellants in second appeals differently and violated equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 3. Also, &sect; 26A.300 was not rationally related to its goal of deterring frivolous appeals, especially where alternate, non-discriminatory deterrents in the court's rules were more effective. Finally, &sect; 26A.300 deterred all discretionary review motions, so it limited the court's exclusive power under Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 110(2)(b), 116, to exercise appellate jurisdiction under its own rules. So, the statute violated separation of powers provisions of Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27, 28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the judgment imposing a penalty on the coal company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, high school teachers and administrators, sought review of the judgment from the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which ruled that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing appellee students' 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim based on a U.S. Const. amend. IV violation as well as their state claims for violations of the right to privacy and negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1998, during a physical education class, a student reported missing a pair of shorts. Students were then taken in pairs to a locker room and searched. There was a factual dispute as to how the search was conducted. The students, all females, allege that they were required to pull their shorts down beneath their knees and to raise their shirts above their breasts, exposing their underwear to those around them. The teachers/administrators stated that they only required each student to turn her waistband down so they could tell if the students were wearing the missing shorts. The students sued the teachers and administrators. The trial court dismissed their claims, but the appeals court reversed. On appeal, the court found that the law, at the time the searches were conducted, did not clearly establish that searches conducted in either described manner would be unreasonable; therefore appellants were entitled to qualified immunity. The court found that the actions of appellants were made in good faith, were discretionary in nature, and were within the scope of their authority because the school board policy against strip searches did not clearly apply to the searches at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and reinstated the trial court's judgment dismissing the students' claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee claimant filed an application for benefits with the Kentucky Department of Workers' Claims. Appellee administrative law judge (ALJ) dismissed the claim. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky ruled that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(3) and the regulations promulgated thereunder, 803 Ky. Admin. Reg. 25:009, &sect;&sect; 3(1) and 3(2), were unconstitutional as they violated the claimant's due process rights. Appellant employer challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(3) set forth a two-step consensus procedure for evaluating x-ray evidence of coal workers' pneumoconiosis. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(13) created a presumption that a consensus x-ray classification was correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. 803 Ky. Admin. Reg. 25:009, &sect; 3(1) prohibited parties from submitting any x-ray readings in addition to those submitted with the initial application and response. 803 Ky. Admin. Reg. 25:009, &sect; 3(2) prohibited the ALJ from considering any x-ray readings but those the parties initially submitted and the readings from three neutral experts. The claimant asserted that his right to due process was violated when he could not submit additional x-rays and readings to rebut the consensus. The state supreme court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(3) was constitutional as it did not deny the claimant his right to due process. However, the administrative regulations defeated the purpose of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(13) and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(3)(b)(4)(g) by prohibiting the claimant from submitting additional reports of x-rays and prohibiting the ALJ from considering the reports.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the appellate court was affirmed in part as to the administrative regulations being unconstitutional; the judgment of the appellate court was reversed in part as to the constitutionality of the statute, and the claimant's application was remanded to the ALJ for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murdering, kidnapping, and robbing two victims and of sodomizing one of them. He received two death sentences for the murder convictions, two death sentences for the kidnapping convictions, and a total of 60 years' imprisonment for the two counts of robbery and one count of sodomy. The Fayette Circuit Court (Kentucky) denied his Ky. R. Civ. P. 60.02 motion for a new trial, from which he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and his accomplice kidnapped the victims and robbed them. Defendant sodomized one of them and fatally shot them both. Defendant argued that he was entitled to a new trial because, 11 years after defendant's conviction, his accomplice recanted his statement to the police that implicated defendant in the crimes. The high court disagreed; recanted testimony was unreliable, and the trial court did not believe the recantation. Even if admission of this hearsay statement violated defendant's Confrontation Clause rights under Crawford, the error was harmless because this evidence was cumulative and there was a mountain of other evidence of defendant's guilt. A juror had not, as defendant claimed, dishonestly answered a voir dire question about her views on capital punishment. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 422.285, allowing death row inmates to request DNA testing, was an unconstitutional infringement upon the high court's rule-making prerogatives, but the supreme court extended comity to &sect; 422.285 and would enforce it because it did not unreasonably interfere with the orderly functioning of the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, the Kentucky Attorney General and others, sought to prevent appellant Governor of Kentucky's anticipated suspension of 153 statutes pursuant to his spending plan. The Governor and appellant Secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet appealed from a Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) decision that declared the Governor's plan unconstitutional but authorized its continuation. The supreme court granted transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the General Assembly adjourned sine die without enacting an executive department budget bill for the 2004-06 biennium, the Governor announced that he would formulate his own executive department spending plan. The issue was whether the Governor could order money drawn from the state treasury to fund the operations of the executive department of government if the General Assembly failed to appropriate funds for that purpose. The supreme court found that the Governor could not do so. Kentucky was a strict adherent to the separation of powers doctrine pursuant to Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27, 28, and in the absence of a specific appropriation or a statutory, constitutional, or federal mandate, the unambiguous language of Ky. Const. &sect; 230 prohibited the withdrawal of funds from the state treasury. The Governor had no constitutional authority to exercise legislative powers even when the General Assembly failed to do so. The Governor possessed no &quot;emergency&quot; or &quot;inherent&quot; powers to appropriate money from the state treasury that the General Assembly, for whatever reason, had not appropriated. The suspension of statutes by the Governor's spending plan was unconstitutional and invalid ab initio.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">That portion of the trial court's judgment that declared the Governor's plan unconstitutional was affirmed insofar as it required expenditure from the treasury of unappropriated funds other than pursuant to statutory, constitutional, and federal mandates. That portion of the trial court's judgment that authorized unappropriated expenditures for other limited and specific services previously approved was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) denied defendant's motion for postconviction expert fees under Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42 to support his Rule 11.42 motion and denied his requested ex parte hearing under Rule 11.42 for expert fees under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31.185. Defendant petitioned the court for a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to conduct an ex parte hearing on his request for expert fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant requested a writ because he contended that the trial court was acting erroneously within its jurisdiction, i.e., refusing to hold an ex parte hearing on his request for funds to retain an expert to prove his counsel was ineffective. A Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42 motion that fully complied with Rule 11.42 was to disclose the need for funds, however, which eliminated any need for an ex parte hearing. Defendant erroneously presumed that expert funds were available under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31.185 in a Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42 proceeding. Funds for expert fees had been held not to be available under Rule 11.42; they were also not available under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31.185. That was because &sect; 31.185 provided for funds for the &quot;defending attorney.&quot; That clearly indicated that the funds were available only at the defense stage of criminal proceedings. In the postconviction relief stage, defendant became the moving party and bore the burden of attacking the conviction, which the State was to defend. As a result, defendant in the Ky. R. Crim. P. 11.42 proceeding was not a defendant and the attorney representing him or her was not a Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31.185 &quot;defending attorney.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Marshall Circuit Court (Kentucky) of use of a minor in a sexual performance, possession of matter portraying a sexual performance by a minor, and being a persistent felony offender in the second degree. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant said the trial court improperly excused jurors who did not appear for jury service. The supreme court held nothing showed the trial judge, or a subordinate, excused these individuals. The trial judge said he did not know why the jurors were not present, indicating the missing venire members did not have prior approval to miss jury duty. There was no evidence the trial court disregarded Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 29A.150(1)'s mandate to order the missing jurors to show cause for their failure to appear. Defendant showed no prejudice or that the trial court erred in denying his motions for continuance or dismissal. His belligerent conduct before trial raised a serious courtroom security issue, and, as he refused to assure the trial court he would not engage in any outbursts during trial, the trial court could order him restrained during the trial. The Commonwealth did not have to produce expert testimony showing defendant's victims were real, as opposed to virtual, children. The jurors viewed the images on which they based defendant's conviction, so it was not &quot;clearly unreasonable&quot; for the jury to find guilt, nor was defendant entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Court of Appeals (Kentucky), in reversing the lower court's decision in appellee retiree's declaratory judgment action against appellant, the Kentucky Employees Retirement Systems (KERS), concluded that KERS acted ultra vires in denying the retiree's benefit application such that the retiree was not obliged to exhaust all administrative remedies before bringing her declaratory judgment action. The KERS appealed. The retiree cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeals court had concluded that the due process rights established by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61.665 could not be abridged by agency regulation and, therefore, that the KERS was acting ultra vires when it denied the retiree's benefit application without submission to a second medical examiner. The highest court decided, however, that the retiree was required to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial intervention. A KERS hearing officer (HO) issued recommended orders on preliminary issues but had not yet held a hearing to consider the retiree's claim (since the instant declaratory judgment action was pending) and entered a final decision. The KERS board had not yet been presented with an appeal of an HO decision or entered its appealable final order under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 13B procedures. The highest court also found there was no applicable exception to the exhaustion of remedies doctrine. Until the board issued its final order, it was premature for the retiree to appeal to a court (1) that the board was going to apply 105 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:210 and (2) that 1:210 was unconstitutional as applied or in conflict with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61.665(2)(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The highest court (1) held that the appeals court erred in holding that the retiree was relieved of her obligation to exhaust all administrative remedies due to an inconsistency between the regulation and statute and was obliged to obtain a final order from the agency before seeking judicial redress, (2) reversed the appeals court's judgment, and (3) reinstated the lower court's judgment dismissing the retiree's action for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Appellee Commonwealth was substituted for the warden as a party to the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate had been convicted of two counts of capital murder, and he was sentenced to death. The inmate filed a civil action claiming that he was exempt from the death penalty. In affirming, the court treated the inmate's claim as an independent civil action under Ky. R. Civ. P. 60.03, even though certain technical rules were not followed. The court then considered whether its statutory scheme dealing with exemptions for mentally retarded defendants was constitutional under Atkins. The bright-line maximum intelligence quotient of 70 in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.130(2) did not violate the Eighth Amendment. And, there was nothing unconstitutional in the requirement that mental retardation be determined prior to trial under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.135. Further, an otherwise death-eligible defendant was not entitled to have a jury decide the mental retardation exemption claim. The court applied the &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard to the burden of showing that the exception applied. The inmate was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he failed to produce evidence creating a doubt about mental retardation under Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 532.140(1).</SPAN></P>

The Attorney General had initiated an ouster action against the board member, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;160.180, seeking to disqualify the board member from holding office due to nepotism.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board member was elected to a county board of education and was administered the oath of office. The board member's uncle was employed as a bus driver for the county school district at the time of the board member's election. The Attorney General asserted that the board member was disqualified from office based on &sect; 160.180(2)(i), which made board membership ineligible to certain relatives employed by the school district, namely a father, mother, brother, sister, husband, wife, son, daughter, aunt, uncle, son-in-law, or daughter-in-law. Each lower court had determined that &sect; 160.180 was unconstitutional, because there was no rational basis for the difference in classification for aunts and uncles, but not nieces and nephews. Another case involving a niece resulted in that board member not being disqualified. The court found that the inclusion of the aunt/uncle classification within the definition of relative in &sect; 160.180 furthered and rationally promoted the governmental goal of eliminating nepotism. The court was unable to say that the Kentucky General Assembly acted irrationally by not including niece/nephew and drawing the line elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the lower court and remanded the case to the trial court for entry of a judgment consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The accident happened while the property was being loaded on the injured person's truck. The appellate court ruled a waiver of governmental immunity was found only where stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text of a statute as left no room for any other reasonable construction. Absent such waiver, claims for damages against the Commonwealth, agencies enjoying governmental immunity, and employees enjoying official immunity could have been heard only in the Kentucky Board of Claims. Since the injured person's action was brought in a judicial court and not in the Board of Claims, the trial court properly dismissed it unless (1) the sale or disposal of surplus property by the board was a proprietary function, in which case the board was not immune, or (2) the general assembly had statutorily waived the board's immunity. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 160.310 did not waive the board's governmental immunity from suit either expressly or by such overwhelming implications from the text as left no room for any other reasonable construction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that inadmissible hearsay was admitted. The state's highest court held that a witness's testimony that a nontestifying accomplice told defendant that he had the city &quot;lit up like the Fourth of July&quot; was inadmissible hearsay as the witness was not in the room and did not know if defendant heard it or agreed with it. Further, improper admission of the witness's testimony that the accomplice told her that defendant killed the victim could not be cured by a mere admonition to disregard it. Evidence that a witness had been previously convicted of a felony and that he had failed to appear for sentencing was inadmissible under the pre-2003 version of Ky. R. Evid. 608, which was to be used upon retrial. The improper introduction of misdemeanor juvenile convictions was not bad faith for purposes of precluding retrial on double jeopardy grounds. The victim's daughter was properly allowed to testify at sentencing since the victim's widow chose not to testify. However, it was error to allow both the victim's daughter and the victim's sister to testify.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While on parole for rape, the inmate committed robbery; his parole was revoked, he was convicted of robbery and of being a persistent felony offender, and he was sentenced to prison. The Board initially recommended parole, but rescinded that recommendation. While the instant litigation proceeded, the Board granted him parole subject to conditions involving sexual offenders. The sex offender program legislation was not in effect at the time of his rape conviction, but was in place when he was initially paroled. The supreme court held the Board's decision was not arbitrary, nor was it based on improper evidence. Under 501 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:030, &sect; 4(2)(a), the Board could rescind a parole recommendation any time prior to the inmate's release on parole. As he was advised of the reasons for the decision, had the opportunity to be heard, and had no fundamental right to parole, his due process rights were satisfied. The Board's application of sex offender statutes,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 439.340(11), 197.400 - 197.440, which were not in effect when the inmate committed rape, did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, as there was no enhancement of punishment or elongation of a sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer sued defendants city and clerk, challenging a tax imposed by the city and seeking class certification. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed that part of a judgment of the trial court that found the tax unconstitutional and denied class certification but reversed that part of the judgment that found the tax to be illegal. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted ordinances which, inter alia, levied a flat-rate tax on every residential unit or lot and business unit in the city regardless of value for the provision of a life squad and other emergency but nonfire-related services. The appellate court held that the annual flat-rate tax was unauthorized under Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 171, 174, 181 in the form chosen. In Kentucky, local real property taxes were required to be ad valorem, and thus based on assessed value. Since the flat rate tax was a specific or per unit tax and not based on value, it was invalid and unconstitutional. The tax could not have been deemed ad valorem by judicial action and thereby come within Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 134.590(3). It was error for the intermediate appellate court to apply that statute. It was also incorrect to hold that a request for class certification for refund purposes was improper. Class action relief was available with respect to the common law remedy for aggrieved taxpayers. The city taxpayers paid the improper tax under the mistaken belief that the taxes were correct and to avoid burdensome penalties and, thus, they were under duress or coercion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The part of the opinion which upheld the trial court's finding that the flat tax on property was unconstitutional was affirmed, as was the decision to allow a class. The parts of the opinion that held that the life squad taxes were deemed ad valorem for refund purposes and that held the taxpayer was not entitled to a class certification for refund purposes were reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court for class certification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was 45 and a former sheriff, took a nude photograph of a 13-year-old boy. He had told the boy that two young women had approached him and expressed their desire to have sex with the two of them, but wanted to exchange nude photographs first. Defendant was convicted of promoting a sexual performance by a minor under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 531.320. The court of appeals affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial, finding that because defendant admitted to a prurient motive in taking the photograph, evidence of defendant's other &quot;bad acts&quot; of homosexual voyeurism was not crucial to the Commonwealth's case. The court found that the prejudicial effect of the evidence was devastating and encouraged the jury to convict defendant because of what he was, rather than what he did on the occasion of the charged offense. The court also found that although the photograph could be found to be lewd when considering a six-factor test, one of which considered whether the visual depiction was intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer, defendant was entitled to a new trial because the jury did not have an opportunity to make that finding.</SPAN></P>

Wrongful death claims against the Commonwealth and other governmental entities were dismissed on sovereign immunity.

The lower appellate court affirmed, prompting the administratrix to appeal. The administratrix argued that emergency driving was a ministerial function that did not warrant qualified immunity. The trooper argued that his actions were discretionary since state troopers were given discretion in performing their daily duties. The court found that the trooper undertook a ministerial act in responding to an emergency call from a fellow officer. While decisions were required in the course of driving, the act of safely driving the police cruiser, even in an emergency, was not an act that required any deliberation or the exercise of judgment. Whether the trooper was negligent in operating his police cruiser was a question for the trier of fact. As such, summary judgment was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Review was granted in plaintiff pedestrians' personal injury action after the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed all but one of the aspects of the trial court's judgment in the case. The appellate court reversed a trial court ruling that certain employees of defendant Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government (LFUCG) were entitled to qualified immunity in the case. Both the pedestrians and LFUCG sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pedestrians were struck by defendant driver as they attempted to cross a highway in LFUCG. Suit was filed against the driver, LFUCG, and for if its employees. The trial court dismissed the suit as to LFUCG based on sovereign immunity but ruled it would stay in the case for apportionment purposes. The actions against the employees were dismissed based on qualified immunity. The court affirmed in part, holding that (1) urban county governments such as LFUCG were entitled to sovereign immunity as a separate classification of counties; (2) as LFUCG was a county government, the Kentucky Board of Claims did not have jurisdiction over the pedestrians' claims as the Board was vested with jurisdiction only over municipalities; (3) Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 67A.060, which retained sovereign immunity in urban county governments, was not an unconstitutional violation of the pedestrians' jural rights; (4) because of its sovereign immunity, fault could not be apportioned to LFUCG under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.82; and (5) maintenance of traffic-control devices was a ministerial duty to which qualified immunity did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the appellate court's holding that fault could be apportioned against LFUCG.

The court held that the Board of Claims had no jurisdiction in the case. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted for crimes related to her actions in gathering her three children, ranging in age from two to six, in a bed with her, dousing the room in lighter fluid, and setting them on fire. All of the children escaped except the two-year-old, who died of smoke inhalation. Defendant attempted to take the stand, but was prevented from doing so multiple times, including at her sentencing hearing, after her attorney argued she was trying to commit suicide by insuring that she would receive the death penalty. She was gagged and forcibly dragged from the court at one point in the presence of the jury. Defendant was convicted, and she appealed. She raised many issues, but the court determined that the denial of her right to testify, a right guaranteed under Ky. Const. &sect; 11 and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 421.225, mandated reversal and remand. Even though the trial court was trying to protect defendant from herself, it had not held defendant incompetent to stand trial, and it had a duty to allow defendant to testify, especially since denial of the right created prejudice manifested in defendant being forcibly dragged from court and not being allowed to present her story to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant guardian challenged the decision of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which affirmed a trial court decision upholding Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 311.631 as constitutional. Appellee Kentucky Cabinet for Human Resources had petitioned the trial court for judicial approval of a recommendation to withdraw life-sustaining treatment to the guardian's ward. The ward died during the course of the proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ward had previously been deemed disabled and was appointed the guardian. He incurred total and irreversible cessation of all normal brain function as a result of suffering cardiopulmonary arrest. The recommendation of the ward's treating physician, a consulting neurologist, and a hospital ethics committee was to withdraw all life-sustaining treatment, except for artificially administered nutrition and hydration until after death occurred. Section 311.631 authorized a judicially appointed guardian of an adult patient, who lacked decisional capacity and had no advance directive, to make health care decisions on behalf of the patient, including withdrawal of artificial life-support systems, without obtaining advance judicial approval, so long as the guardian acted in good faith and in the best interest of the patient. The guardian contended that &sect; 311.631 was unconstitutional and violated public policy. The court held that a surrogate was permitted to withhold or withdraw life-prolonging treatment from a patient, such as the ward, who was permanently unconscious or in a persistent vegetative state, without prior judicial approval, so long as all interested parties agreed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed, in part, the decision of the appellate court that approved the withdrawal of life-support from the ward and reversed, in part, the decision with regard to the applicable standard of proof. The court held that remand was unnecessary in light of the death of the ward.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had the opportunity to both call and cross-examine witnesses at the competency hearing. The court was not persuaded that defendant did not understand the charges against him based on a thorough review of the record, as defendant made a statement waiving his rights as a criminal defendant as well as stated that he freely signed and fully understood all documents regarding the guilty plea.

The United States Supreme Court granted appellant manufacturer's petition for certiorari, vacated the state's highest court's decision, and remanded the case to the state's highest court for consideration of the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sole issue was the viability of the punitive damages award. The Court had held that punitive damages violated the Due Process Clause if they were excessive and that out-of-state conduct could not be considered in awarding punitive damages. The state's highest court, on remand, found that the jury had considered the manufacturer's conduct on a nationwide scale in arriving at the punitive damages award. A new trial on the amount of punitive damages was required as the jury instructions contained no limitation on extraterritorial punishment. The error in the jury instructions was preserved for appeal as the manufacturer's tendered instruction had severable paragraphs and the trial court could have avoided the error by cutting and pasting and incorporating the relevant paragraph. While the instruction on the standard for awarding punitive damages included portions of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.184 that were later held to be unconstitutional, the jury's finding that punitive damages were proper was law of the case. The state's highest court directed that an instruction be given that set forth the purpose of punitive damages and provided a safeguard from extraterritorial punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was vacated as to the punitive damages award. The case was remanded for a new determination of the amount of punitive damages, if any, in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge rejected the plea agreement because the punishment that could be imposed was too lenient. Appellants claimed that the trial judge acted either outside his jurisdiction or erroneously within his jurisdiction regarding the plea agreement. In affirming the appeals court, the supreme court held that (1) the right to appeal any conviction did not provide an adequate remedy to appellants; (2) judicial approval of the dismissal or amendment of an indictment was required, and that requirement did not create a separation of powers violation; (3) the trial judge acted within his jurisdiction in denying motions to dismiss and/or amend the indictments; (4) refusing to accept the plea agreement because it was too lenient was not an abuse of discretion; and (5) consideration of statements from the victims' families was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded. Motion for relief granted in part, denied in part and remanded.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, a county food and beverage association, challenged an order of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), which denied its motion for emergency injunctive relief after a circuit court granted summary judgment to appellee county in the association's action alleging that a county ordinance, which effectively banned smoking in public buildings, was preempted by state law, improperly infringed on property rights, and was vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance eliminated smoking in all restaurants and bars in the county, including cigar bars, nightclubs and taverns. Affirming in part, the court held that (1) the prohibition on smoking was well within the traditionally recognized authority of local government as a health matter, and the ordinance was not expressly or impliedly preempted by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 438.300, or any other Kentucky statute; (2) the ordinance's requirement that smokers had to maintain a &quot;reasonable distance&quot; from the entrance of buildings was not vague because individuals could reasonably understand that if their tobacco smoke was entering the building they were not at a reasonable or required distance; (3) however, the provision requiring removal of &quot;smoking paraphernalia&quot; from the premises was unconstitutionally vague because entities that were subject to the ordinance would have to rely on conjecture, speculation, and guesswork when they attempted to bring themselves into compliance; and (4) the circuit judge did not err in denying the association's motion for default judgment because it would have been inappropriate pursuant to Ky. R. Civ. P. 55.01 where the county defended itself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the summary judgment for the county in part and remanded the case for entry of judgment declaring the provision of the ordinance requiring the removal of smoking paraphernalia unconstitutional and enjoining its enforcement. As to the remainder of the ordinance, the court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment for the county. Accordingly, the ordinance banning smoking in public places was permitted to go into effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant dock one sought review of a decision by the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) which affirmed a trial court ruling that appellee Revenue Cabinet of the Commonwealth of Kentucky properly assessed a sales tax on gas sold to the dock's houseboat rental customers. In a second case, the Cabinet appealed a ruling that a declaratory action regarding Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 139.483 could be made without an exhaustion of remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the first case, dock one argued that sales of gas to its renters were exempt from sales and use taxes under &sect; 139.483 because the fuel was consumed in the operation of vessels used principally in the transportation of property or the conveyance of persons for hire. In the second case, appellee dock two had sought a declaratory judgment that houseboat rentals were not subject to sales and use taxes and an injunction preventing the Cabinet from assessing or collecting such taxes. Dock one intervened in the second case. The court affirmed the first decision but not the second one. The exemption in &sect; 139.483 did not apply to houseboats used principally for lodging. The transportation of property by such vessels was insignificant and the conveyance of persons accomplished through the vessels' use was ancillary to the primary purposes of lodging and recreation. Further, as the declaratory judgment action did not raise any issue of the facial validity or constitutionality of &sect; 139.483, the parties were required to exhaust their administrative remedies and they had not done so. Finally, although not properly before it, the court ruled that &sect; 139.483 did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court's decision upholding the Cabinet's assessment of the sales tax on dock one was affirmed. The appellate court's decision in the declaratory judgment action was reversed and the case was remanded for reinstatement of the trial court's dismissal of the declaratory action based on lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant killed his ex-wife's parents and tried to kill her. The supreme court held he had notice of the death penalty, was not denied a speedy trial, and inculpatory statements were admissible. Despite drugs in his body, his statements were not involuntary. The trial court let defendant waive the extreme emotional disturbance (EED) defense, and did not instruct on it, as that would violate his control of his defense, and there was no supporting evidence. An order barring his contact with a victim was relevant to motive. Defendant had oral notice that his failure to return a gun to a prior employer would be used against him, and it was relevant, as the gun killed two victims. A victim's statements to a 911 operator and officer were excited utterances, and the 911 statements were authenticated. Circumstantial evidence showed defendant wrote inculpatory documents, and a missing part that would not alter the introduced portion did not have to be admitted. Wanton murder, second-degree manslaughter, and second-degree assault instructions were unsupported. His no-contact order violation was an aggravating circumstance. A murder in a tool shed was done during a burglary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction arose from driving into a yard while intoxicated and striking and killing a pregnant woman. He contended on appeal that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to exclude all jurors for cause who had been exposed to media reports about the incident, in failing to suppress his blood alcohol test results, in allowing evidence of his refusal to take the test, by permitting evidence that the victim was pregnant at the time of her death, and by permitting the introduction of evidence of previous convictions. The court found no error in the trial court's refusal to exclude all jurors for cause who had been exposed to media reports, because the trial court excluded the jurors who had knowledge about the accident and had already formed an opinion. The blood alcohol test results were properly admitted, because a search warrant had been obtained despite defendant's involuntary refusal of the test. Evidence of the victim's pregnancy was properly admitted where it was not excessively expounded upon. However, the evidence of defendant's alleged prior convictions was inadmissible because they had not been vacated and were never finalized by entry of a judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Laurel Circuit Court (Kentucky) of murdering her husband and tampering with physical evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed she found her husband on the floor with several gunshot wounds to his back. Two weeks after the murder, the murder weapon was found in defendant's trash. The State alleged that defendant's motive for murdering her husband was his discovery that she had forged his name on loan papers. The supreme court held that a bank manager, a non-expert, was properly allowed to testify under Ky. R. Evid. 701 that she compared the signature on the loan papers with that on the husband's driver's license, and that the two did not look the same. While defendant was acquitted at her first trial of killing a cat, evidence that she did so was admissible in the second trial under the lower burden of proof required by Ky. R. Evid. 404(b), as the jury could have found she killed the cat to confuse the crime scene; Commonwealth v. Hillebrand, 536 S.W.2d 451 (Ky. 1976), was overruled to the extent it was inconsistent with this ruling. Testimony that defendant said her husband would divorce her if they lost their trailer was properly admitted as a statement of a party opponent under Ky. R. Evid. 801A(b)(1), and under Ky. R. Evid. 803(3) as the victim's declaration of present intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment and sentence were affirmed. Defendant would be eligible for parole consideration after serving 25 years of her 55-year sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the trial court of violating Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 440.270(2), prohibiting a bondsman from detaining a fugitive without a warrant, and related offenses. Defendant appealed his conviction under &sect; 440.270(2) and the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed. Defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was an Ohio bondsman arrested for detaining a fugitive in Kentucky with no warrant. The supreme court held Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 440.270(2) did not deny full faith and credit to an Ohio warrant. Section 440.270(2) remotely regulated interstate bail bonding and was not unconstitutional. Its distinction between defendant and those who could arrest with no warrant had a rational basis. He did not lack &quot;fair warning&quot; of an unforeseeable statutory construction or change in common law, as the court did not change statutorily abrogated common law, or an interpretation of unconstrued &sect; 440.270(2). The warrant did not justify his actions, as it did not order him to arrest the fugitive. No instruction on his belief that his actions were authorized but for a legal defect was required, as the warrant was valid. He had to recklessly arrest the victim knowing no Kentucky judicial officer issued a warrant to violate &sect; 440.270(2). His claimed mistake of law did not negate these mental states. As he was unaware of &sect; 440.270(2) and thought a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowed his acts, a mistake of law instruction was required and he could tell the jury of that decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee county employee sued appellants, the county merit board and county officials, after he was fired. After the Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed summary judgment for the employee, he filed additional counts against appellants and the trial court granted summary judgment to appellants. The Court of Appeals affirmed as to some counts and vacated summary judgment as to other counts. Appellants sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officials said they were entitled to sovereign and qualified immunity. The supreme court held the Court of Appeals' first decision in the case established the law of the case as to the parties, despite a subsequent different resolution of some issues by the supreme court. One official sued in his individual capacity was entitled to qualified official immunity, and summary judgment as the decision he made, later reversed by the trial court, was a discretionary act done in a legally uncertain environment. No county officials were entitled to immunity under the Eleventh Amendment as to the employee's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims because defenses to this federal cause of action were defined by federal law, which held local governmental bodies, like counties, were not arms of the state, and therefore were liable for their constitutional violations. Given the legally uncertain environment in which one official made his challenged discretionary decision, he was entitled to qualified immunity as to the employee's &sect; 1983 claim. Allegations against other officials made it impossible to determine if they were entitled to qualified immunity, requiring a clarification on remand.</SPAN></P>

Otherwise, the Court of Appeals' judgment reversing summary judgment as to the employee's &sect; 1983 claim was affirmed. The matter was remanded for clarification of &sect; 1983 claims against other officials sued individually.</SPAN></P>

At the subsequent capital sentencing proceeding, the jury found the presence of an aggravating circumstance and fixed defendant's punishment at death. The trial court entered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and an accomplice escaped from an Oklahoma prison in 1991. They stole vehicles and kidnapped and killed a man while traveling through various states before entering Kentucky. In Kentucky, defendant and the accomplice kidnapped a man, stole his vehicle, and killed him. When a state trooper made a traffic stop of defendant and the accomplice, the accomplice fled and defendant fired two shots at the trooper. Defendant and the accomplice were later both apprehended. The accomplice testified against defendant. In a pretrial motion, defendant advised the trial court that he consented to application of the 1998 amendments to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.030, and moved the trial court to include life without parole as a sentencing option available to the jury if the trial proceeded to a capital sentencing phase. The trial court did not so instruct the jury. The supreme court reviewed defendant's allegations of errors and affirmed the conviction, but found that defendant's pretrial motion satisfied the unqualified consent requirement, and that he was entitled to the instruction on life without parole. Accordingly, a new capital sentencing phase before the trial court was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Henderson Circuit Court (Kentucky) for manufacturing methamphetamine and possession of a controlled substance in the first degree. He was sentenced to consecutive prison terms of 15 years and five years, respectively. He contended, inter alia, that he was not permitted to voir dire the jurors as to whether they could consider the full range of penalties and that an improper jury instruction was given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The police discovered a series of items used in the manufacture, ingestion, or sale of methamphetamine in defendant's residence and on his person. The appellate court held the indictment's amendment did not prejudice defendant's substantial rights, as he was convicted as charged in the original indictment. The trial court's denial of defendant's motion in limine to be allowed to voir dire prospective jurors as to whether they could consider the full range of penalties for each charged offense was erroneous, as defendant was denied the right to determine whether each prospective juror was qualified to serve on the jury. The error was not harmless, as the jurors did not impose the minimum sentence allowable for either conviction. The trial court properly precluded defendant from calling a witness, who had invoked his Fifth Amendment right, and eliciting testimony from any other witness regarding out-of-court statements made to them by that witness. The jury instruction given was an instruction on the lesser offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Thus, his conviction of manufacturing methamphetamine had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The conviction of manufacturing methamphetamine and the 15-year sentence imposed therefor was reversed and the matter was remanded for a new trial. The conviction of possession of a controlled substance in the first degree was affirmed. The five-year sentence was vacated and the matter was remanded for a new sentencing phase trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Franklin County Circuit Court (Kentucky) found that appellants, probation and parole officers (claimants) in two separate actions, were entitled to salary increases under the Career Ladder Program, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 196.076, and the Salary Equity Fund, 1990 Ky. Acts ch. 514, pt. III, &sect; 20. The Court of Appeals reversed the findings in the first action, and on appeal in the second action, the matters were consolidated for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimants argued that they were entitled to both the Career Ladder Program and Salary Equity Fund increases. The instant court found that the 1990 Budget Bill, rather than repealing the Career Ladder Program when enacting the Salary Equity Fund, continued the program, but limited benefits under the Salary Equity Fund to those officers whose benefits thereunder would exceed their benefits under the Career Ladder Program. In other words, while probation and parole officers were entitled to benefits under both the Career Ladder Program and all other increments or other salary increases authorized by law, the legislature did not authorize full Salary Equity Fund benefits for them. Salary Equity Fund benefits were only authorized to supplement Career Ladder Program benefits so that the salary adjustments for probation and parole officers were the greater of the Probation and Parole Career Ladder Program. Finally, because the Budget Bill did not repeal the Career Ladder Program, the court did not reach the claimed constitutional and statutory violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The result reached by the Court of Appeals was affirmed, the trial court's judgment was reversed, and each case was remanded to the trial court for entry of judgments in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159.051 unlawfully discriminated against students with educational disabilities and violated students' rights to equal protection and due process. The intermediate appellate court rejected the trial court's finding that the statute infringed on the exercise of a fundamental right, though it agreed with the trial court's position that the right to an adequate education was a fundamental right under the Kentucky Constitution. The appellate court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159.051 created a geographically-based distinction between students who lived in counties with an alternative education plan, which made them subject to losing their licenses under the statute, and students who lived in counties without an alternative education plan, which precluded them from being subject to losing their licenses under the statute. There was no rational basis for this classification, and thus Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 159.051 was unconstitutional. The holding rendered moot the challenge to the creation of a new waiver form requiring parents to consent to the release of his or her child's education records.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he alleged that appellee Kentucky Department of Corrections violated the Ex Post Facto clauses of the federal and state constitutions by calculating his expiration date in accordance with Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted of incest and sentenced to prison. Pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 197.045(4), which the Kentucky General Assembly enacted after the inmate's conviction and sentence, the inmate could not receive Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 197.045 good time credits against sentences for his subsequent convictions on later sodomy and rape convictions until he successfully completed the Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP). The inmate did not meet this requirement. Therefore, the Department performed its sentence calculations as to the inmate's later convictions without a good time credit allowance. On appeal, the court found that, because the inmate was not entitled to the discretionary non-educational good time and meritorious good time credits, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 197.045(4)'s requirement that the inmate, as a sex offender, successfully completed SOTP before he was eligible to earn such good time credits did not increase the punishment for criminal acts. Accordingly the Department did not violate federal or state ex post facto protections when it calculated the expiration date for the inmate's later convictions in accordance with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 197.045(4).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the circuit court of rape and robbery. The Commonwealth conceded reversible error in permitting the prosecutor to impeach defendant with a juvenile adjudication that occurred before Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 610.320(4) was enacted, but appealed the ruling of the Kentucky Court of Appeals that the circuit court reversibly erred in denying defense counsel's request to inspect records of the victim's psychotherapy treatment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant wished to inspect the alleged victim's psychotherapy records for exculpatory and impeachment matters; the trial judge inspected them in camera and found that they contained no information relevant to defendant's due process and confrontation rights. The supreme court held that (1) the victim did not waive her psychotherapist-patient privilege by testifying under compulsion about her treatment; and (2) the Compulsory Process Clause afforded defendants the right to obtain and present exculpatory evidence, including impeachment evidence, in the possession of a third party that would otherwise be subject to that privilege. The trial court alone was to conduct an in camera inspection of psychotherapy records only upon receipt of evidence supporting a reasonable belief that such review might yield exculpatory evidence, including impeachment evidence. To the extent Eldred v. Commonwealth, Ky., 906 S.W.2d 694 (1994), required a lower standard for such review, and the presence of the prosecutor and defense counsel while it took place, it was overruled. The supreme court's own review of the records confirmed the trial court's conclusion that they contained no exculpatory evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was arrested following an attempted traffic stop and a lengthy high speed chase, was convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine, driving on a suspended license, and fleeing and evading police in the first degree in the Graves Circuit Court (Kentucky). He appealed, arguing that the court improperly directed a verdict on certain charges, and asserting that certain evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial judge erred in directing a verdict of guilt on two charges, but that the defense should have been granted a directed verdict on the manufacturing charge. He also claimed that the trial judge improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of the original traffic stop, and that the manufacturing criminal statute,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.1432(1)(b), was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court granted relief on the first two arguments. The district court clearly erred in directing a guilty verdict, although defendant admitted in his testimony that he was driving on a suspended license and had eluded police. The finding of guilt, once defendant had entered a guilty plea, could only be made constitutionally by a jury. The trial court also erred in allowing the manufacturing charge to go to the jury because defendant had not possessed the essential ingredient of anhydrous ammonia. Defendant had not been charged with possession of a controlled substance and the jury had not been instructed on an alternative theory of actually manufacturing. The statute itself was constitutional, and the original traffic stop was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions for driving on a suspended license and fleeing police that were not submitted to the jury were reversed. The judgment of conviction and sentence imposed for manufacturing methamphetamine was vacated, as defendant was entitled to a directed verdict on that charge. The argument that evidence should have been suppressed based on a for lack of probable cause to stop defendant was denied. The matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Logan Circuit Court (Kentucky), which convicted defendant of trafficking in marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, manufacturing methamphetamine, possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, possession of anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, and operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol or an impairing substance (DUI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped while driving erratically and was arrested for DUI. A search incident to the arrest revealed marijuana, cocaine, and drug paraphernalia on defendant's person. The back seat and trunk of the vehicle contained a methamphetamine laboratory. Defendant claimed that he had borrowed the car and had not noticed the items in the back seat because the car was always messy. The court found a discovery violation under Ky. R. Crim. P. 7.26(1) to be harmless error, absent a showing of prejudice. Defendant was not entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal because the evidence was sufficient to infer his knowledge of the methamphetamine laboratory, which had a strong odor. The trial court erred, however, in excluding evidence that tended to show the owner of the car might have been the perpetrator of the methamphetamine-related charges. Although defendant was not entitled to offer such evidence merely to impeach the credibility of the car's owner, defendant had a due process right to show that another person might have been the perpetrator. Moreover, defendant's convictions for manufacturing methamphetamine and possession of methamphetamine constituted double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for trafficking in marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, and DUI. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial on the methamphetamine-related charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Kentucky Board of Trustees of the Judicial Form Retirement System (JFRS). filed for a declaratory judgment, requesting a declaration that H.B. 389(4), 2000 Reg. Sess. (Ky. 2000), amending Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21.450, was valid, and sought a judicial construction. The Kentucky Court of Appeals held in favor of appellee State, finding the bill was invalid for noncompliance with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6.350. The JFRS sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court had accepted the theory that the amendment of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21.450 actually amended Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61.510(13), and that its effect was to increase the &quot;assumed salary&quot; of legislators as of July 14, 2000, and to apply Consumer Price Index (CPI) increases to the assumed salary on an annual basis thereafter. The circuit court had further concluded that H.B. 389(4), 2000 Reg. Sess. (Ky. 2000) was unintelligible only to laypersons, but understandable to pension law specialists, despite the fact that the executive director of the JFRS was unable to comprehend its meaning. The Kentucky Supreme Court concluded that H.B. 389(4), 2000 Reg. Sess. (Ky. 2000), subsequently codified at Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21.450(3), was unconstitutional because it was unintelligible and violated the nondelegation doctrine, embodied in Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 27, 28, 29 and 60. Any effort to have ascribed some rational meaning to the bill would have been solely conjecture. If the legislative intent in amending Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21.450 was to amend Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61.510(13), that fact was certainly not apparent, or even vaguely discernible, from the language of the bill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision of the court of appeals was affirmed, though on different grounds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted in the circuit court under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.510 (2000), for failure to register his change of address. Defendant challenged the application of that version of the statute to him. The circuit court ruled that the statute was applicable to defendant. Defendant petitioned the Court of Appeals of Kentucky for a writ prohibiting further prosecution of the indictment. The petition was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether defendant was subject to prosecution for failing to provide a valid home address to the sex offender registry to a Class D felony, under the 2000 version of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.510, or a Class A misdemeanor, under the 1998 version of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.510. Defendant contended that the 2000 version was not applicable to him because the 1998 version was effective at the time he registered with the Kentucky sex offender registry. The supreme court found that the 2000 amendments were only intended to apply to persons who were required to become registrants following April 11, 2000. Thus, defendant was not among the individuals the Kentucky General Assembly intended to be subject to the 2000 version of the statute. The felony indictment charged against defendant was void ab initio. Thus, the circuit court did not have proper jurisdiction over defendant. The felony indictment charged against defendant had to be dismissed. If defendant was to be prosecuted regarding an alleged violation of the statute, then it would have to be under the 1998 version. Further, the proper court of jurisdiction would be the Jefferson District Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order of the appellate court was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the appellate court with directions to issue a writ in conformity with the views expressed in the opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employee settled a workers' compensation claim. Years later, the employee moved to reopen the claim, but the motion was dismissed by the Kentucky Workers' Compensation Board. The employee again moved to reopen the claim, but that motion was also dismissed. The employee sought review before the Court of Appeals of Kentucky. The Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's decision. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was injured in 1978 and settled her claim in 1982 for a lump sum. In 1994, she moved to reopen, but the motion was dismissed for lack of prosecution. In 2001, she again moved to reopen on the ground of a change of disability, submitting an affidavit in which she stated that a post-award worsening of her physical condition had caused her to become totally disabled. The motion was dismissed on the ground that it was not filed before December 12, 2000, as required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.125(8) (1996) (amended 2000). The employee argued that the statute was unconstitutional and that it should not be applied retroactively to awards that were entered before its effective date. The supreme court found that the employee's right to benefits for a post-award increase in disability vested when the motion to reopen was filed, without regard to when the increased disability began. Furthermore, &sect; 342.125(8) afforded the employee a reasonable four-year period after December 12, 1996, in which to assert a right to increased compensation. Finally, the provision did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 59(24).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) of murdering a mother and child, and of attempted murder of another child, all in the course of a robbery. He was sentenced to death for the murder of the child; life without parole for the murder of the mother; 20 years enhanced to life for the attempted murder of the second child, and 20 years enhanced to 50 years for the robbery. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant killed the victim and her child, and tried to kill another child. The supreme court held the indictment sufficiently told defendant what was charged. The trial court's inquiry into whether jurors agreed with their religious denomination's position on the death penalty was not improper. Admitting the mother's pregnancy was not improper. A jailhouse informant could testify as to defendant's admissions. An extreme emotional distress instruction was unnecessary as to the child murder victim because any triggering event as to the mother, murdered first, was interrupted when she said defendant could have the money he wanted, so extreme emotional distress did not apply to the child. The language &quot;engaged in the commission of a robbery&quot; in the aggravator in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.025(2)(a)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague. The jury could consider options other than death, and was not told it needed a reasonable doubt to impose a death sentence. Defendant's children's penalty phase testimony would have been cumulative. There was no cumulative error, the trial judge's report complied with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.075, and defendant's sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Jefferson Circuit Court (Kentucky) convicted defendant of first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance (cocaine), three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment, attempting to elude police, and resisting arrest. Defendant also pled guilty to being a first-degree persistent felony offender. The trial court sentenced him to 20 years in prison and ordered forfeiture. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his convictions and other judgments entered against him, first contending that the trial court impermissibly limited his voir dire by ruling that defendant could only inform the jury panel that the possible range of penalties was one day to life, without any further explanation. The appeals court disagreed. Given defendant's guilty plea to the persistent felony offender charge, and the imposition of the minimum possible 20-year sentence, any error was harmless. Second, a contested photograph, or at least its contents, was arguably relevant in light of defendant's explanation for the source of the money seized from him. Third, as defendant was not provided notice of the forfeiture action, he did not have any opportunity to present evidence to rebut the presumption that his property was forfeitable. Moreover, no evidence was offered that the money was traceable to any drug trafficking activities. Finally, since the trial court did not conduct any forfeiture proceedings, an analysis of the excessiveness of forfeiture was premature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions, sentence, and felony persistent offender finding were all upheld. However, the forfeiture order was reversed, and the matter was remanded for a hearing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court first held that voir dire properly examined the juror for predisposition, a juror with extrajudicial knowledge was properly disqualified, and selection of death qualified jurors was not unconstitutional. Further, evidence that a victim was pregnant was properly admitted, a pathologist was qualified to testify as an expert, and admission of a crime scene video was not cumulative. Also, defendant's requested jury instructions concerning theories of defense were properly rejected for lack of supporting evidence, a videotape record of the trial satisfied the requirement for a trial record on appeal, and the indictment was not required to include aggravating circumstances. Moreover, the use of one murder as an aggravating circumstance in the other murder did not constitute double jeopardy, lethal injection was not cruel and unusual punishment, defendant's death sentence was not discriminatory or disproportionate, and the jury was properly instructed that it was not required to impose the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A workers' compensation claimant appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeals (Kentucky). The court of appeals held that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.125(8) was constitutional and thus affirmed a decision by appellee workers compensation board, which had dismissed appellant claimant's motion to reopen a disability claim on the ground that it was not timely filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant was injured in 1990, and he settled his claim in 1994. Effective December 12, 1996, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.125(3), (8) were amended to, among other things, limit the period for reopening previously-decided claims to within four years of December 12, 1996. When the claimant moved to reopen on August 13, 2001, alleging that his physical condition had worsened and that he had become totally disabled, his motion was dismissed on the ground that it was not filed before December 12, 2000. The court affirmed. The claimant's injury and his award both occurred before December 12, 1996, and the amendment to &sect; 342.125(8) limited the reopening of such an award to within four years of the amendment's effective date. Thus, the period for reopening the claimant's award expired on December 12, 2000. His motion to reopen was thus properly dismissed on the ground that it was filed after December 12, 2000.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Pulaski Circuit Court (Kentucky) denied defendant's motion to suppress items seized in a warrantless search, he was convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine by possessing the chemicals or equipment for the manufacture of methamphetamine with the intent to manufacture it, in violation of Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 218A.1432(1)(b). The offense was enhanced to a felony by his possession of a firearm at the time of the offense. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer saw defendant, who appeared intoxicated, furtively reach his arm through a slightly opened car window. He consented to the search of a bag found in the car, which contained lithium batteries and antihistamine tablets -- items commonly used to manufacture methamphetamine. A consent search of the car produced methamphetamine, chemicals, and equipment associated with its manufacture, and a loaded handgun. The supreme court affirmed denial of the suppression motion, since police had reasonable grounds to suspect defendant of theft or intoxication, and had reasonable suspicion of illegal drug activity sufficient to request permission to search the vehicle. The failure of the instructions to require the jury to find that defendant possessed all of the equipment needed to manufacture methamphetamine required reversal (though the evidence had been sufficient to allow such a finding, as well as to convict). The evidence was sufficient to prove defendant's constructive possession of the firearm and the nexus between the drug offense and the firearm possession under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.992. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 218A.1432(1)(b) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim, 73, was bludgeoned to death and her home was robbed. Her body was found in the trunk of her burning car. Defendants admitted being present when the crimes were committed, but each accused the other of committing the crimes. Each testified to helping the other carry the body and load it into the trunk. The supreme court found no error in the trial court's denial of one defendant's motion for a separate trial, even though each defendant cast the blame on the other. Introduction of Bruton-redacted versions of defendants' pre-trial statements, in which each admitted only his/her presence at the crime scenes and neither admitted committing the crimes, and which deleted their respective defenses, was not error; neither could introduce his or her own out-of-court statements to assert a defense without subjecting himself or herself to cross-examination. Claims of reversible error in jury selection, evidentiary rulings, defendants' absence at hearings, jury instructions given during the guilt and penalty phases, and the prosecutor's arguments were rejected. The evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. The death sentences were neither excessive nor disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother brought an action directly to the state's highest court seeking a writ of mandamus to require appellee Kentucky Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) to reimburse the mother for the costs of preparing and transcribing transcripts for an in forma pauperis appeal of her circuit court case to the intermediate appellate court. The Floyd Circuit Court (Kentucky) had denied a motion to require the AOC to pay for the transcript.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother argued that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 453.190(1) imposed a financial obligation on the AOC to pay the transcription costs of indigents pursuing an appeal. The state's highest court found that the mother sought reimbursement for costs already expended. The trial judge gave the parties the opportunity to submit an appeal on an agreed statement rather than on the certified record on appeal as contemplated by Ky. R. Crim. P. 75.07. If that opportunity had been used, the question of costs of a transcript would not have arisen. There was no irreparable injury or great injustice that would result and the mother had an adequate remedy by appeal through the appellate courts, making a writ of mandamus inappropriate. The case was not one of great public importance. Section 453.190(1) contained no language requiring the AOC to pay for transcripts for an appeal. Further, to order the AOC to pay would violate the separation of powers doctrine. The trial court properly denied the request to order the AOC to pay for an appellate indigent record transcription.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pretrial diversion program adopted in Kenton County, Kentucky, directed the Commonwealth to make a written recommendation to the circuit court in response to each application within seven days. In each of the two cases, the Commonwealth objected to the defendant's pretrial diversion application. One judge in the circuit court denied the first defendant's application after concluding that it had no authority to grant the application over the Commonwealth's objection. A second judge in the circuit court concluded that he could order pretrial diversion without a favorable recommendation from the Commonwealth, and granted the second defendant's application for pretrial diversion over the Commonwealth's objection. The supreme court found that under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 533.250(2) the Commonwealth had to give its consent before a circuit court had the authority to approve a defendant's application to participate in a pretrial diversion program. Thus, where the Commonwealth objected to a pretrial diversion, the circuit court could not unilaterally approve either defendant's diversion program application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, misdemeanors. Each offense was enhanced to a felony by a finding that he was in possession of a firearm when the offenses were committed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the search of his home violated the Fourth Amendment and Ky. Const. &sect; 10, and, therefore, the evidence obtained as a result of the search should have been suppressed. The supreme court held that knowledge that there were firearms present in defendant's home, gained when defendant let the officer's in, was sufficient to trigger the requisite reasonable suspicion to justify the subsequent search. Defendant also argued that there was insufficient evidence to support a nexus between the firearms discovered in his home and his possession of the controlled substances, and therefore to support the firearm enhancement. As the weapons and the controlled substances were all in the same room, the supreme court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the enhancement. As for the PFO enhancement, the supreme court concluded that defendant's rights were not prejudiced based on a clerical error in the indictment. Finally, defendant argued that the sentence imposed constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The supreme court found no error, as the sentence did not exceed that allowed by statute and was not disproportionate to the nature of the offenses.</SPAN></P>

The Secretary of State certified the candidacy of their slate. However, an action was brought against the other person, running for the lieutenant governor's position, that sought a declaration that he was not a bona fide candidate for lieutenant governor. The trial court found that the other person was not a bona fide candidate. No appeal was taken. The challenger then brought an action against the candidate and others, in which the challenger sought to bar the candidate from naming a substitute to the slate. The Secretary of State certified that a vacancy existed in the candidate's gubernatorial slate. The trial court then ruled that the candidate was a bona fide candidate entitled to designate a new running mate. After the challenger appealed, the state supreme court found that the Secretary of State's certification that a vacancy existed due to the other person's disqualification to hold office meant that the candidate was entitled to name a new running mate to the slate, based on Ky.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant accident victims sued the drunken driver in circuit court for personal injuries. Upon the driver's death, the circuit court permitted the driver's estate and executrix to be substituted for the driver. The trial court granted the estate's and the executrix's motion in limine, excluded evidence as to punitive damages, and did not instruct on punitive damages.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victims suffered injuries in an automobile collision caused by the drunken driver, and later filed a lawsuit against the driver. The driver, however, died before trial, and the trial court substituted the driver's estate and the executrix as the party defendants. The trial court then dismissed the victim's punitive damage claim as Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.184 did not authorize a punitive damage award against the driver's estate and the executrix because the estate and the executrix did not act toward the victims with oppression, fraud, or malice. The appellate court agreed with the trial court's reasoning. The supreme court found that under the plain language of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.184(2), to recover punitive damages from the estate and the executrix, the victims had to prove that the estate and the executrix acted toward them with oppression, fraud, or malice. This, the accident victims failed to do. Therefore, the victims could not recover punitive damages from the estate and the executrix.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the Marshall Circuit Court (Kentucky) denied defendant's motions to suppress and for a protective order, he entered a conditional plea to manufacturing methamphetamine, possession of a controlled substance in the first and third degree, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, endangering the welfare of a minor, and being a persistent felony offender. He was sentenced to 20 years. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A confidential informant told police that defendant was manufacturing methamphetamine at his home. Defendant argued that the probable cause affidavit was defective for not describing the informant's reliability, veracity, and basis of knowledge. The appellate court disagreed. The informant provided detailed descriptions of defendant's methamphetamine operation and the contents of his lab, stated that he had personally observed the items in the lab, and made statements against his penal interest (that he himself had possessed items used in the methamphetamine manufacture). This provided sufficient indicia of reliability to justify issuance of the warrant. The trial court did not violate defendant's Confrontation Clause rights by ordering that the informant's testimony be taken by videotape deposition in South Dakota. The Commonwealth stated that the informant was unavailable because he could not receive a pass to leave a &quot;Teen Challenge&quot; program in South Dakota in time for trial; this was a reasonable basis for the trial judge to conclude, without resort to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 421.250, that to compel the witness to attend a trial in Kentucky would cause him undue hardship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the Jefferson Circuit Court, Kentucky, awarded appellant administrators compensatory and punitive damages in their respective wrongful death suits against appellee employer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">All parties challenged the judgment entered. The instant court first held that the legislature made it clear that the employer, through the board of waterworks, was prohibited from contracting or acting on behalf of the city. Further, the board controlled the employer's day to day operations, with the city controlling only through its ability to vote in some of that body's members. This relationship alone did not make the employer an agent of the city. Thus, punitive damages were not precluded. On the cross-appeal, the court held that the employer was not denied due process when the jury was instructed on gross negligence. The instructions correctly defined gross negligence. It was enough that the employer's conduct was so outrageous that malice could be implied from the facts. This egregiousness and the minimal amount awarded to compensate the victims' families supported the amount of punitive damages imposed. The employer was also on notice that failure to properly close a public roadway could result in severe injury or loss of life. Finally, the jury apportioned relative fault among the parties and the compensatory damages amount was reduced accordingly.</SPAN></P>

The Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) dismissed the charges, but the Court of Appeals of Kentucky reversed the trial court's judgment. The state supreme court granted review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One defendant worked as a lieutenant governor's labor liaison until he resigned his position and went to work for a labor organization while the lieutenant governor ran for governor. He was paid by the labor organization until the lieutenant governor won the election, and then returned to his former position in the lieutenant governor's office. After the lieutenant governor became governor, he appointed defendants, two people who served as officers of the labor organization, to positions in state government. In a prosecution charging defendants with violating Kentucky's campaign finance laws, the state supreme court held that (1) although Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 121.015(6)(e), 121.150(1) (1995) were unconstitutional in whole or in part, defendants could not challenge portions of those statutes that were not being applied to them; (2) the portions of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 121.015(6), 121.150(1) (1995) that were unconstitutional could be severed from the portions that were constitutional; and (3) the mens rea element of &quot;aware or should have been aware&quot; in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 121.015(10) did not deny defendants due process of law or violate their First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

He dispelled their suspicions and gave consent to search his car. He was arrested when it was discovered he had outstanding warrants. He was read his Miranda rights. He vaguely requested an attorney. The search of the car turned up items used to manufacture methamphetamine, and a handgun. At the police station, he made incriminating statements without an attorney present. He then confessed. After he was convicted, the state supreme court found his constitutional rights were violated at the police station when the Commonwealth failed to show he clearly waived his rights to an attorney. It also found: (1) a lesser-included jury instruction was not warranted, (2) no error occurred in denying his directed verdict motions, (3) evidence of the handgun possession was properly admitted at the guilt phase, and (4) the manufacturing methamphetamine statute neither was void for vagueness nor failed to notify him of the illegal conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a lawsuit, the police department was required to hire or promote one minority member for every two majority members hired or promoted until a racial parity with the community had been achieved. Otherwise, the factors applicable to promotions remained as required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 78.440(7), which hindered minority promotion due to its reliance on seniority. Later, the Police Merit Board (Board) undertook to devise a method to give minorities and women equal promotion chances. The Board replaced the system previously used with a system known as &quot;banding&quot; which dropped individual rankings and considered all individuals within a certain range of qualifying scores to be equally qualified. The police chief soon recommended for promotion two black police sergeants, but did not recommend two white police sergeants in the same band. A jury awarded damages to the white police sergeants, but the trial set aside the award and entered judgment NOV against them. After the appellate court reversed, the state supreme court found that the two white police sergeants had not shown that the &quot;banding&quot; affirmative action plan used to remedy prior discrimination was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Kenton Circuit Court (Kentucky) of murder, first-degree burglary, first-degree robbery, theft by unlawful taking, and obtaining money by fraud. He was found to be a first-degree persistent felony offender, and was sentenced to death on the murder conviction. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The murder victim was strangled in her home, and her property was stolen. Defendant had cleaned the victim's carpets before the theft, and was also tried on a charge of theft of jewelry from another carpet-cleaning customer. In opening and closing, defense counsel admitted that defendant was a &quot;thief and burglar,&quot; but maintained that he was not the murderer. The appellate court found that under Cosby, none of the unpreserved errors were reversible. The trial court had not been obliged to inquire sua sponte whether defendant consented to his counsel's admissions of guilt during opening and closing. It did not err in refusing to sever the theft case under Ky. R. Crim. P. 6.18, as the two incidents were intertwined. Defendant received a fundamentally fair trial; the few instances of harmless error were insufficient to warrant reversal of his convictions. However, after the crimes were committed, H.B. 455 (Ky. 1998) took effect, authorizing a sentence of life without probation or parole (LWOP) in capital cases. Under Ky. Rev. Stat. 446.110, the trial court erred by denying an instruction on LWOP, as defendant gave his &quot;unqualified consent&quot; to the retroactive application of H.B. 455.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions were affirmed. This case was remanded to the trial court for a new penalty phase wherein defendant would be eligible for an instruction on life without parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The deputy appealed is termination by appellee sheriff to appellee merit board. Before the board could hold a hearing on the matter, the sheriff filed an action for injunctive relief and a declaration of rights in the circuit court. The circuit court concluded that the merit board statutes,&nbsp;Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 70.260 et seq., were unconstitutional and granted injunctive relief. The appellate court agreed. The state supreme court, however, held that the appellate court's holding was contrary to well-established law. Ky. Const. &sect; 99 merely created the office of sheriff; it was silent as to the power to employ or remove deputies. That power was created by the general assembly in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 70.030. Thus, the general assembly could take common-law powers away from executive officers and assign them to different executive officers or agencies without violating the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that: (1) evidence of the discovery of the victim's body should have been suppressed (2) his confession should have been suppressed; and (3) the violent offender statute was unconstitutional. The court of appeals disagreed. The officer who found the victim's body did so because he reasonably believed that the victim might be in need of immediate assistance. This was an exigent circumstance authorizing a warrantless search. The victim had been reported missing for two days and she and defendant had experienced marital problems. Defendant had refused an earlier request to see the victim, and when the officer returned to the apartment no one answered his knock on the door, and an unusual odor was emanating from inside the apartment. There was no bright line rule that Miranda warnings had to be repeated whenever there was a delay between the warning and the interrogation or whenever the warning was given by someone other than the interrogator. Finally, violent offenders did not have a greater minimum parole eligibility date than other offenders who received longer sentences, including a sentence of life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee administrative law judge (ALJ) awarded appellant employee workers' compensation benefits, but ruled that her benefits would terminate when she reached age 65, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.730(4). Appellee Kentucky Workers' Compensation Board declined to review the ALJ's ruling, but the Court of Appeals of Kentucky held that &sect; 342.730(4) was unconstitutional as written. The employee and cross-appellant employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An employee, who was employed by the same company for almost 40 years, developed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and she was awarded permanent total disability workers' compensation benefits. However, the ALJ who made that award ruled that, pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.730(4), the employee's entitlement to those benefits would terminate when she reached 65 years of age. The Kentucky Workers' Compensation Board declined to review the ALJ's ruling, but the Court of Appeals of Kentucky held that &sect; 342.730(4) was unconstitutional as written and interpreted it not to require that the employee's workers' compensation benefits terminate when she reached age 65, but to require a dollar-for-dollar offset of social security benefits the employee actually received against her workers' compensation benefits. The state supreme court held that: (1) &sect; 342.730(4) was not unconstitutional; and (2) &sect; 342.730(4) afforded no basis for the court of appeals' ruling that the employee could continue to receive workers' compensation benefits after she reached age 65, reduced by a dollar-for-dollar offset for social security benefits she actually received.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state supreme court reversed the intermediate appellate court's judgment to the extent it interpreted the statute in a way that allowed the employee to receive reduced workers' compensation benefits after she reached age 65.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A trial court denied defendant's request for prerelease probation, ruling that the statute authorizing such probation, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 439.575, was unconstitutional, as it violated the separation of powers provisions of the Kentucky Constitution. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed, and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 439.575 purported to grant trial courts the authority to make &quot;probation&quot; decisions regarding inmates they sentenced to prison at any point during their period of incarceration. The trial court held that &sect; 439.575 vested in the trial courts the executive function of parole, in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. On appeal, defendant argued that, as &sect; 439.575 provided for the executive branch's &quot;participation&quot; in the trial court's prerelease probation decision in the form of eligibility determinations and/or a mandatory favorable recommendation from the department of corrections, there was no separation of powers violation. The supreme court held that, by permitting the judiciary to exercise the purely executive function of granting parole, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 439.575 violated Ky. Const. &sect; 28, and the executive branch's participation in the judiciary's exercise of its power did not alter that fact. That Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 439.575 referred to &quot;probation, &quot; rather than &quot;parole,&quot; was immaterial: it was the substance of the power conferred, not the name given to it, that controlled.</SPAN></P>

After defendant was convicted, the prosecutor introduced defendant's juvenile record during the penalty phase of trial. The trial court's rulings were based on Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.055(2)(a)6, which was enacted in 1996 to allow use of juvenile records during criminal trials if a defendant was charged as a juvenile with committing a felony and a juvenile court found that he committed the offense charged. The state supreme court held that (1) the ex post facto provision of the state and federal constitutions did not prohibit the trial court from using defendant's juvenile records during his criminal trial; but (2) although the provision of &sect; 532.055(2)(a)6 that permitted use of defendant's juvenile court records during the penalty phase of trial was lawful, the provision of &sect; 532.055(2)(a)6 that permitted use of his juvenile records for impeachment violated the separation of powers doctrine and was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 242.185(6). The teetotallers brought a declaratory judgment action in Franklin Circuit Court (Kentucky) to challenge the constitutionality of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 242.185(6). Appellees were government officials and citizens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court found that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 242.185(6) did not violate Ky. Const. &sect; 59 and holding of a local option election on a regular election day was permissible under Ky. Const. &sect; 61. The teetotallers argued that the statute drew an unconstitutional distinction between restaurants that could sell alcohol by meeting the statute's minimum requirements and any other business that might want to serve liquor but could not meet the statute's requirements. The statute's classifications were constitutional under &sect; 59. The court found that the classification made i.e., that only restaurants or dining facilities that seated a minimum of 100 persons and derived 70 percent of their gross receipts from the sale of food could apply for licenses under the statute was reasonably related to the statute's purpose. The teetotallers asserted that results of any and all elections held pursuant to &sect; 242.185(6) on a general election day were void under &sect; 61. This was error. Section 61 allowed local option elections to be held on regular election days as well as non-election days.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant estate brought a products liability claim against appellee manufacturer of a truck. The manufacturer filed a third party complaint seeking apportionment against appellant employer of the decedent, and the employer counterclaimed for reimbursement. A jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages to the estate. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) reversed. The estate and the employer appealed and the manufacturer cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court had designated the estate and the employer as plaintiffs and ruled that they should have had separate peremptory challenges. The intermediate appellate court held that the estate and the employer were not antagonistic and that they should have shared peremptory challenges. The appellate court held that the manufacturer placed the estate and the employer on opposing sides, and there was no error in allowing separate peremptory challenges. The trial court clearly considered all relevant questions and determined that expert testimony proffered by the estate satisfied the requirements of Kentucky law. The jury could have believed that the manufacturer was well aware of the transmission flaw which caused the decedent's death, but that it continued producing and installing such transmissions, thus acting with flagrant indifference to the lives of its consumers. The punitive damages instructions were proper, but upon de novo review, $ 5 million of the $ 20 million punitive damages award should have been set aside. The evidence was sufficient to permit the employer to have been heard on its claim and the trial court erred in directing a verdict against it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The opinion of the intermediate appellate court was reversed. The compensatory damages award and $ 15 million of the punitive damages award were reinstated. The judgment of the trial court, affirmed sub silento, granting a directed verdict against the employer, was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sanitation company made a claim against defendant county sewer district pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65.115, which required a public corporation that maintained a sewer service to compensate for taking the customers of another sewer service. The sewer district moved to dismiss, which he trial court granted. The Court of Appeals (Kentucky) affirmed. The state supreme court granted discretionary review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The sanitation company owned a waste water treatment facility. The sewer district planned to tie into the pipe system that served the sanitation company's customers. This would have rendered the facility valueless. The sewer district did not plan to pay the sanitation company, nor did it file an eminent domain action.  Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. 65.115 had previously been found unconstitutional as special legislation. The appellate court held the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss the claim, as once an appellate court had declared a statute unconstitutional in its entirety, the statute could not thereafter provide any rights or powers under Kentucky law. The court of appeals, under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 446.090, could have theoretically been able to sever the unconstitutional portion of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 65.115, leaving the remainder intact. However, the court of appeals held the statute unconstitutional in its entirety, a fact neither the state supreme court nor the general assembly had changed in eight years. The state supreme court held it was not now appropriate for it to revisit the severability of a statute previously held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI). The Jefferson County District Court, Kentucky, suppressed the results of the blood alcohol test and found defendant not guilty of DUI, but guilty of reckless driving. The Commonwealth filed a motion for certification of the law, which was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that the statutorily required warning required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 189A.105 was inaccurate, as a person convicted of first offense DUI may receive only a fine and no mandatory jail time. The supreme court held that, while the implied consent warning in &sect; 189A.105 was defective as applied to suspected drunk drivers not subject to minimum jail time, the defect was not a violation of a constitutional right. Although the officer did not correctly educate defendant on the consequences of refusal, the warning neither offered implicit assurances that defendant would not be subject to jail, if he consented to the test, nor guaranteed jail time, if he refused. It merely informed him of the possibility of additional jail time should such be mandated for the underlying DUI offense. While the statutory warning may have been inaccurate, the duty to submit to testing was foremost under the statutory scheme. Thus, the implied consent warning contained in &sect; 189A.105 was not so defective as to prejudice a suspected drunk driver's decision-making process, as there was no constitutional right to refuse to submit to a test to determine blood alcohol concentration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Jefferson Circuit Court, Kentucky, convicted defendant of third-degree rape and two counts of third-degree sodomy, and required him to register with the local probation and parole officer as a sex offender for a period of 10 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that he was not subject to any version of the Kentucky Registration and Notification Statutes for Sex Offenders, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.500 et seq. The appellate court found that the statutes did not offend Ky. Const. &sect;&sect; 47, 51. 2000 Ky. Acts 401 and Ky. S.B. 263 did not render the ultimate statutes unconstitutional. The title was neither false nor misleading. The statutes did not violate any constitutional protection against double jeopardy or ex post facto laws. The registration and notification required by the statutes did not amount to punishment. The statutory system was a remedial measure designed to protect and inform the public and not to punish the offender. The desire by defendant to keep information about his criminal record private, especially when most of the information was a matter of public record, did not come within the traditional interpretations of the privacy right. Even if defendant had some limited right of privacy in the data, the need for public safety far outweighed his individual rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Kentucky Court of Appeals, in three separate opinions by three different panels, declared the Sexual Offender Registration Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.500 et seq., both constitutional and unconstitutional as a violation of the state constitutional separation of powers doctrine after defendants appealed trial court rulings that classified them as high-risk sex offenders. The state supreme court granted discretionary review of the cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three different trial courts were presented with three different case in which defendants were about to be released after serving sex offense sentences. Pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act (Act), Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17.500 et seq., the trial court had to classify defendant's likelihood that he would commit another sex offense. Defendants were each classified as a &quot;high-risk sex offender.&quot; They posed a number of constitutional challenges to the Act, including its subsequent amendments to add a risk assessment procedure and its requirement that sex offenders post certain information on an Internet web site. In two of the cases, the Act was declared constitutional, while in the third case it was found unconstitutional. After judgments were entered on the constitutional challenges, the state supreme court found the Act was constitutional as it was remedial, not punitive in nature, and, thus, did not violate ex post facto laws. It also found the public's compelling interest in protecting itself outweighed any privacy interest any defendant had and that the legislature permissibly gave the trial courts subject matter jurisdiction to implement the Act's provisions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment holding the Sexual Offender Registration Act (Act) constitutional was affirmed in two appellate cases. The judgment finding it unconstitutional on separation of powers grounds in the third appellate case was reversed and the trial court's judgment in that case was reinstated. Since the procedural rights at trial of the two defendants where the Act was found constitutional were violated, remands were required in those cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant injured his back while working for the employer. He later filed claims for the back injury and a hearing loss allegedly caused by work noise. An audiologist tested the claimant and concluded the hearing problem was related to work. The back injury cause was divided equally between the injury and arousal of dormant, pre-existing degenerative changes. The administrative law judge (ALJ) rejected the audiologist's opinion and found half the back injury was due to natural aging. The workers' compensation board reversed the ALJ's decision on the hearing problem and found degenerative changes in the back were not necessarily related to age. After the appellate court reversed and agreed with the ALJ that the hearing problem was not related to work, and agreed with the board the back injury might be compensable, the state supreme court found the ALJ's conclusion had to be affirmed as to the hearing problem since the ALJ had a reasonable basis for it. It also found the back injury claim had to be remanded to determine which part of the degenerative changes, if any, were compensable. Furthermore, it found on the cross-appeal that the audiologist's testimony was admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

He also alleged the county board of education and the state high school athletic association were vicariously liable. The trial court held all appellees had immunity. After the appellate court affirmed, the state supreme court found immunity applied to the county board of education which was engaged in a governmental function, the high school athletic director because his rule-making was in good faith, and the state high school athletic association because it was acting as a state agent. However, it further found the negligent supervision action against the one coach and the second coach had to be decided by a jury as a duty to supervise existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with capital murder, kidnapping, and attempted first-degree rape. A competency hearing was conducted. The trial court heard evidence including a defense expert's avowal that defendant was not presently incompetent. The expert's opinion was limited to delusional disorder testimony and how a criminal defendant would be affected by it during a jury trial. The trial court found defendant failed to meet his burden of showing he was incompetent. Defendant objected to admission of photographic evidence and that a mistake of fact jury instruction was not given. A jury instruction cited as an aggravating factor that the murder was allegedly committed during a kidnapping. After he was convicted and sentenced to death on the murder charge, the state supreme court found substantial evidence supported the competence finding and he was not prejudiced by the exclusion of expert testimony or admission of the photographs. It further found the jury was properly selected, and no error occurred in not giving the mistake of fact instruction. However, as murder during the course of a kidnapping was not an aggravating factor authorized by law, the death sentence was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions were affirmed, but defendant's death sentence on the capital murder conviction was reversed and the capital murder conviction was remanded to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

P. 11.42 motion alleged ineffective assistance of counsel in two respects: failure to pursue defendant's mental incompetency defense and failure to prepare for trial. Both the trial court and the court of appeals erred by holding that defendant's motion should be dismissed because the record did not prove the allegations of a secret plea agreement, not because the record conclusively disproved those allegations. Defendant not only received the maximum sentence, he asserted that counsel told him he was unprepared to try his case and represented to him that the consequence of his guilty plea would be the imposition of the minimum sentence. The issue of whether there was an agreement could not be conclusively resolved on the face of the record of the Boykin hearing. An evidentiary hearing on defendant's Rule 11.42 motion was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The clerk sent a letter to his employees asking support for a political candidate. The Registry found probable cause that the clerk had violated Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 121.310(1). The clerk argued that the statute was unconstitutional on its face. The Court of Appeals reasoned that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 121.310(1) was unconstitutional, because the phrase &quot;have been requested&quot; cast too wide a net and prohibited any number of examples of innocent (non-coercive) political speech. The purpose of the statute was to prevent an employer from coercing his or her own employees into voting a certain way. The clerk's letter enjoyed full First Amendment protection because it did not affect the reliability of the electoral process. The statute was inconsistent with the First Amendment and patronized the employee because it assumed the employee lacked a free will when voting a secret ballot. The clerk's letter did not cross the threshold of persuasion or impair the important governmental interest of ensuring free elections and assuring people that the voting process was fair.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supreme court ruled on four claims of error by the employee: (1) the admission of hearsay evidence in the form of written summaries of interviews made by the employer's attorney with former co-workers about the events leading up to employee's discharge that were marked as exhibits and taken to the jury room for consideration during deliberations; (2) requests for admissions served on the employer; (3) evidence of alleged post-discharge retaliation; and (4) punitive damages. The summaries were inadmissible hearsay and contained numerous prejudicial assertions and opinions that were not repeated in sworn testimony at trial. The error was compounded by allowing the summaries into the jury room. The trial judge properly extended the deadline to respond to the employee's requests for admissions, but erred in not permitting the employee to introduce the admissions as substantive evidence at trial. The employee could not present evidence of post-discharge conduct because her complaint alleged causes of action that occurred only up to the time of her termination. The employee was not entitled to punitive damages as the employer was not vicariously liable for the acts of her co-workers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff claimant sought benefits for a work-related gradual injury June 9, 1998. A Kentucky administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded the 1995 injury was barred by the period of limitations, but she sustained additional injury from work she performed within two years of filing her claim and awarded benefits for that. She appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was clear that claimant knew, and notified her employer of her work-related injury in December, 1994. The ALJ determined her gradual injury became manifest no later than February 15, 1995, more than two years before her claim was filed. The appeal by the claimant followed unsuccessful appeals to the Workers' Compensation Board and the Court of Appeals. The appellate court concluded there clearly was substantial evidence that she sustained a gradual injury and knew it was caused by her work no later than February 15, 1995, and substantial medical evidence supported the findings that a portion of her functional impairment and occupational disability were attributable to trauma incurred within two years of the filing of the claim and, were compensable. The relevant question was whether the limitations period could either be waived or revived by payment of a salary continuation benefits after the period expired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was stopped for suspicion of operating a vehicle while his driver's license was suspended. A Breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol level was 0.274. It was the defendant's third driving under the influence offense. Defendant was sentenced as a third time offender under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 189A.010(4)(c). Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 189A.010(4)(c) since the subsection imposed different penalties upon third time offenders based upon their intoxication level. On appeal, the supreme court found the statute was constitutional because (1) defendant failed to meet his burden of proof to show the arbitrariness of the statute and (2) the statute did not violate the equal protection clause under a rational basis analysis as there was nothing inherently unfair in treating the same class of multiple offenders differently based on their level of intoxication.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the supreme court found, among other findings, that (1) the decision of the trial court not to give an adverse inference instruction did not amount to constitutional error; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by restricting the voir dire by defendant, striking two potential jurors for cause, rejecting defendant's Batson challenge, denying defendant's motion for continuance, and denying defendant's motion for funding for psychological testing; (3) the trial court's refusal to strike jurors for cause did not violate the right to a fair and impartial jury and did not unnecessarily compromise defendant's use of allotted peremptory challenges; (4) the trial court did not use defendant's statements made during an examination before sentencing to show lack of remorse or the appropriateness of the penalties fixed by the jury; and (5) the trial court did not err in giving an instruction on mitigating circumstances to the jury where that instruction did not require that mitigating circumstances be found unanimously or beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's audit of appellee resulted in use tax assessments on appellee's distribution of pre-printed newspaper advertising inserts and direct mail advertising catalogs. Out-of-state printers produced the inserts and catalogs per appellee's instructions. Appellee had challenged that tax and the court of appeals had reversed the taxation. The supreme court reversed, holding that both the newspaper inserts and the catalogs were subject to the use tax imposed by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 139.310, because they were tangible property stored, used, and consumed in Kentucky in the process of advertising goods. While appellee did not have actual possession of the newspaper advertising inserts, it maintained the right of complete control over the handling and distribution of the inserts after their delivery to Kentucky newspapers for distribution. Once the newspaper subscriber, a potential customer, had possession, appellee had made a taxable use of the insert.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee filed suit claiming the Commonwealth, through an environmental protection agency, had taken its property without just compensation. The trial court granted the judgment on the pleadings to the Commonwealth, due to appellee's failure to exhaust their administrative remedies, and none of the enumerated exceptions applied. On appeal to the court of appeals, the order was reversed, when the court held that appellee had a constitutional claim which could not have been decided within the agency. The Commonwealth appealed and the court of appeals order was reversed. One had to first show injury as a result of a statutory application before the application could be attacked as unconstitutional. There was no application of the statute. Thus, exhaustion was not futile to an as-applied challenge to a statute. Administrative action had to be taken before there could be a claim for constitutional injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order of the court of appeals was reversed. Appellee failed to exhaust its administrative remedies; thus the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear the takings claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was injured in May 1996; his workers' compensation claim was settled in July 1997. In September 1998, he moved to reopen his claim due to changed circumstances. The workers' compensation board and appellate court denied his motion, holding that the 1996 version of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.125(3) prohibited reopening an award within two years of its entry. On appeal, the appellant argued that applying the amended statute to his action that arose before its effective date was unconstitutional. The instant court affirmed. Appellant's award was entered after December 1996, and in his motion to reopen he sought an increase in occupational disability that occurred after the effective date of &sect; 342.125(3)'s amendment. Because the alleged increase in disability occurred after the effective date of the amendment, applying the amendment did not affect a right of appellant's that vested before the amendment's effective date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals (Kentucky) affirmed a workers' compensation board decision that appellee claimant was totally disabled from on-the-job injuries he sustained, that none of his disability was active before the accident, and that none of the nonwork-related conditions was related to the natural aging process. It also upheld a constitutional challenge to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.320(2)(c). Appellant challenged the appellate court's affirmance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee claimant fell down an embankment while working, and struck his back and head. There was evidence he was morbidly obese and had a prior, dormant degenerative back condition. However, there was no evidence either condition was disabling before the accident. An administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded he was totally occupationally disabled from his injuries, that none of his disability was active prior to the accident, and that none of the nonwork-related conditions was related to the natural aging process. Appellant employer appealed, but the workers' compensation board (board) affirmed and remanded to the ALJ to order payment of claimant's attorney fees pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.320(2)(c). That statute did not consider the reasonableness of an appeal in awarding fees. After appellant challenged the board's affirmance, the supreme court held substantial evidence supported the award of permanent total disability benefits, an exclusion was not required for the &quot;natural aging process,&quot; and the evidence did not compel a rehabilitation order. However, the supreme court also found the statute was unconstitutional for arbitrary penalizing good faith appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment was reversed to the extent it upheld the constitutionality of the statute, but was affirmed in all other respects. Substantial evidence supported the determination appellee claimant sustained permanent total disability, that no exclusion was required for the natural aging process, and that a rehabilitation order was not required. However, the statute was unconstitutional as it arbitrarily penalized employers for good faith appeals.</SPAN></P>

The trial court and appellate court did not order the discovery to stop. The supreme court found that the trial court was operating outside its jurisdiction. The jurisdiction to decide whether already-executed administrative warrants were based on inaccurate affidavits rested with the Kentucky Occupational Safety and Review Commission.

The appellate court held that appellant was not entitled to a change of venue, that the challenges for cause were properly denied, that testimony was properly excluded, and that jury instructions were proper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Whitley Circuit Court, Kentucky, convicted appellant of two counts of murder, arson, burglary, and robbery. He was sentenced to death for each murder. He appealed to the Supreme Court of Kentucky as a matter of right, Ky. Const. &sect; 110(2)(b); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.075.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. A witness testified before the grand jury, but died before the appellant's trial began. The appellate court found that the witness's grand jury testimony should have been excluded as inadmissible hearsay because his statements were not statements against his own penal interests. Also, the testimony was not admissible under the hearsay exception for former testimony because the appellant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the witness. Therefore, the improper admission of the witness's grand jury testimony required reversal for a new trial at which none of witness's statements inculpating appellant should be admitted. However, the appellate court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting a crime scene video into evidence. Also, appellant was not entitled to jury instructions on first-degree manslaughter and reckless homicide. Finally, the appellate court rejected appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed and remanded the appellant's conviction and sentence for murder because the trial court improperly admitted hearsay evidence during appellant's trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A developer wishing to use its property in a manner not permitted by the existing zoning laws had filed an application with a planning commission that met none of the requirements, not seeking to rezone or requesting a variance, but seeking approval under IRDRCJ. The application had been granted and the developer's neighbors had attacked the IRDRJC and the circuit court had declared the IRDRCJ unconstitutional. The planning commission appealed to the court of appeals. The Kentucky Supreme Court granted transfer because of the public importance brought about by the use of the IRDRJC and the likelihood that the controversy would arise again. The supreme court found the IRDRCJ regulations impermissibly allowed the planning commission to exercise an authority which was more legislative in nature than ministerial, essentially granted almost unbridled discretion, clearly failed to pass constitutional muster, and were void, thus affirming the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Three appellants were jointly indicted for murder. The Fayette Circuit Court (Kentucky) convicted one of murder and sentenced him to life in prison without benefit of probation or parole for 25 years. Another was convicted of complicity to murder and sentenced to death. The third was convicted of facilitation of murder and sentenced to five years in prison. Appellants sought review. The appeals were considered together.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At trial, the Commonwealth proved that the death-sentenced appellant regularly purchased cocaine from the victim for resale to lesser dealers. The Commonwealth's theory of the case was that the victim stole the death-sentenced appellant's money, and that he, in revenge, hired the life-sentenced appellant to kill the victim. The five-year sentenced appellant was the life-sentenced appellant's driver. Appellants were convicted. The appellate court held that the Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.025(2)(a)4 aggravator applied only to the life-sentenced appellant, the hired killer, who murdered for the purpose of receiving money or other profit, not to the death-sentenced appellant whose motive in procuring the murder was revenge, not monetary gain. The mere fact that a principal might be subject to capital punishment did not mean that his accomplice would. A witness description of the killer that did not match appellant was not admissible either as a present sense impression or excited utterance. Neither Ky. R. Evid. 608 nor Ky. R. Civ. P. 43.07 permitted witness impeachment by absence of a prior consistent statement. An alleged sleeping juror merely closed her eyes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The death-sentenced appellant's sentence was vacated and his case remanded solely for a new penalty phase, at which the jury was to be instructed that the maximum penalty that could be imposed upon him was imprisonment for life. Otherwise, the convictions and sentences were all affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city challenged the order of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, awarding attorney fees pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.320(2)(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">This workers' compensation appeal concerned the constitutionality of the 1996 amendment to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.320(2)(c), requiring an employer or its carrier to pay up to $ 5,000.00 of an injured worker's attorney fees if the employer appealed an award by an arbitrator or Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and did not prevail. The appeals court held that the statute was unconstitutional and reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals. The indiscriminate imposition of attorney fees mandated by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.320(2)(c) on an employer who lost in arbitration resulted in an unequal operation of the procedure. It therefore violated appellant's right to procedural due process. Further, for the sake of clarity and consistency, the court overruled Earthgrains v. Cranz, 999 S.W.2d 218 (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the Court of Appeals was reversed. The statute denied an employer due process of law, as its only purpose was to punish it for bringing an appeal in good faith, and was merely an act of arbitrary power in violation of the Kentucky Constitution. The court also overruled Earthgrains v. Cranz, 999 S.W.2d 218 (1999).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Kenton Circuit Court (Kentucky) convicted appellant of second-degree burglary, found him in contempt for an emotional outburst, and ordered that his felony and contempt sentences run consecutively. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was charged with burglary. The prosecutor during voir dire questioned jurors on their ability to consider any potential punishment in the authorized penalty range, and mentioned sentencing in his closing argument. Appellant was convicted, he made an &quot;outburst,&quot; and the trial court ordered his contempt sentence to run consecutively to his felony sentence. The court affirmed.  Carter v. Commonwealth, 782 S.W. 2d at 601, was overruled insofar as it held that sentencing information was always inadmissible during the guilt/innocence phase of a trial. The prosecutor raised sentencing briefly to properly qualify the veniremembers. The reference to sentencing in closing was not improper because appellant had raised sentencing himself during voir dire. The Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 532.110(1)(a) requirement of concurrent sentencing for definite and indeterminate terms did not apply to sentences imposed for contempt of court, as that would have materially limited the court's power of contempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Conviction and sentences were affirmed. Another court's prior decision that sentencing information was never admissible during the guilt/innocence phase of a trial was overruled. Appellant's counsel had also raised sentencing in voir dire. The statutory requirement of concurrent sentencing for definite and indeterminate terms did not apply to sentences imposed for contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under &sect;&sect; 21A.300 and 21A.310(1), attorneys who solicited accident or disaster victims by mail within 30 days of the accident or disaster were subject to criminal sanctions.

The general assembly acted within its police power to address public outcry against immediate solicitation of victims. The disciplinary power of the supreme court could not address the problem of solicitation by out-of-state attorneys, and the supreme court retained the power to discipline attorneys convicted under &sect;&sect; 21A.300 and 21A.310(1) just as it could discipline attorneys who violated any other statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both parties asserted the other was responsible for the accident. The jury found both at fault, returning a verdict apportioning 60 percent of the fault to appellee and 40 percent to appellant.

The court of appeals, in a split 7-6 en banc opinion, affirmed the trial court's judgment and denial of her motion for new trial. She sought discretionary review in the court, which was granted, and the appellate court affirmed the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because evidence at trial supported the jury's finding that appellant had not suffered additional pain as a result of the accident, the appellate court found the jury's pain and suffering award legally proper and held the trial court acted within its discretion in denying appellant's motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claimant was awarded a 30 percent occupational disability after filing a claim in which she alleged she was totally disabled. Less then seven months after receiving her award, claimant moved to reopen. The Kentucky Worker's Compensation Commission denied her motion because reopening was barred by statute until two years after the award. The court of appeals affirmed, and claimant appealed to the court. The court noted that claimant's injury occurred before the effective date of the statutory amendment which imposed the two year limitation on reopening, but that her award was made after. Because claimant's award was made after the amendment's effective date, the post-award physical and psychological changes which gave rise to the alleged increase in occupational disability also occurred after the effective date. Claimant had failed to demonstrate how applying the amendment to redress a post-award change that occurred after the amendment's effective date violated the Kentucky Constitution. The court noted in closing that neither a worker nor an employer could reopen within two years of an award upon an allegation of a change in occupational disability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent was found to be totally disabled under the 1988 version of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.732(1)(d) and was awarded workers' compensation benefits, which were apportioned 25% against the employer and 75% against the Special Fund as then required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(10)(a). The claimant was born of decedent and his second wife. Relying on Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 342.316(7), both the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and the Workers' Compensation Board denied claimant's request for death benefits; the Court of Appeals found the statute invalid. The court agreed with the ALJ's observation that the statute was, in fact, a saving statute which extended benefits to afterborn children of a marriage existing on the date of the compensable event. The statute denied claimant benefits because her parents were not married to each other on the date of the compensable event. The court reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment reversed. Orders of the Administrative Law Judge and Workers' Compensation Board reinstated, dismissing claimant's application for death benefits; death benefits for occupational diseases were limited to persons related to the disabled worker as of the date of the compensable event, plus after-born children of a marriage existing thereon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurer challenged the affirmation on the whole by the court of appeals (Kentucky) of the trial court's award of compensatory damages and $ 2 million in punitive damages for appellees, couple, in their suit for violations of the Kentucky Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act, specifically Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 304.12-230(1), 304.12-230(4), 304.12-230(6), and 304.12-230(7), in regards to a disputed fire insurance claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Fire destroyed appellees', couple, commercial building. After failing to settle with appellant insurer, appellees sued; won their building's &quot;actual cash value&quot; in their severed breach of contract claim; and won compensatory damages and $ 2 million in punitive damages in their bad faith claim for four Kentucky Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (KUCSPA) violations, Ky.

The existence of jury issues on the contract claim did not preclude the bad faith claim. The trial court did not err in excluding appellant's experts who had no fire loss experience; whose testimony was directed to value, which had been adjudicated in the contract trial; or whose damage estimate had not been procured until after litigation began. KUCSPA was not unconstitutional &quot;special legislation.&quot; Jury interrogatories based on a case-law bad faith claim test satisfied Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 411.184(2)'s punitive damages proof requirement. The amount of punitive damages was not preposterous in that it was less than what would have had sufficient deterrent effect.</SPAN></P>

Taxpayers within the city limits including appellant, were subject to both taxes. Appellant brought a class action, claiming that the ordinance violated the Kentucky Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The circuit court concluded that the ordinance was not unconstitutional and a divided court of appeals panel agreed. Appellant sought to apply Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 68.197 to the ordinance. However, that statute specifically applied only to counties with populations of 30,000 or more.

Appellant sought review in the court of appeals, which affirmed, and appellant challenged that decision. The court ruled that claimant could settle his claim with appellee employer and continue to pursue it against appellant. The court found further that, upon claimant reopening his claim, appellant could not require him to pursue it against appellee employer, since his settlement precluded him from doing so.

Appellee was not estopped from denying appellant's beneficiary status because appellee did not advised appellant or her ex-husband that a divorce subsequent to ex-husband's benefit option would not affect appellant's beneficiary status and the retirement plan stated that a final divorce decree voided a spouse's designation as beneficiary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court entered judgment upon defendants' conditional guilty pleas to first degree sodomy of a child under 12 years of age, first degree sexual abuse, and distribution of obscene matter to a minor. Defendants appealed, contending that their confessions should have been suppressed because the interrogating officer elected not to record the confessions on video or audiotape. The court held, after reviewing the text, history, and previous precedent interpreting Ky. Const. &sect; 11's due process protections, that &sect; 11 did not mandate the electronic recording requirement. Moreover, the court found &sect; 11's protections to be co-extensive with federal due process protections. The court refused to consider defendants' argument that their confessions should have been suppressed under Ky. R. Evid. 801(a), because defendants failed to present this claim of error before the trial court. Finally, defendants' failure to notify the Kentucky attorney general of their constitutional challenges to the statutory sexual offender notification scheme provided the trial court with a sufficient basis to overrule those challenges. Consequently, defendants' convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants' and appellee's tractor-trailer rigs collided on the interstate. At the time of the accident, appellee was insured by a liability insurance policy containing a $ 250,000 deductible; however, appellee investigated, negotiated, litigated, and ultimately paid those claims with its own money. At trial on the tort claims, appellants were granted a directed verdict on the liability issue and were awarded damages of $ 71,143. Appellants then sued appellee for damages for allegedly failing to attempt in good faith to effectuate a settlement of their tort claims prior to trial. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellee, and the appellate court affirmed. Appellants filed an appeal. The court held that appellee was under no contractual obligation to pay appellants' tort claims; thus, there existed no statutory or common law basis for a bad faith claim against it. Furthermore, the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 304.12-230, had no application to a self-insured or uninsured entity, such as appellee, who was under no contractual obligation to pay the tort claim of another. Consequently, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court's judgment was affirmed, because the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act was inapplicable to appellee, who was a self-insured or uninsured entity, and who was not contractually obligated to pay appellants' tort claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment prohibiting appellant's erection of billboards and the court reinstated the circuit court judgment finding that the statute limiting the erection of billboards was constitutional. Appellant applied to erect certain billboards and the application was denied. Nevertheless, appellant began erecting the billboards and appellee, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, filed an action for a permanent injunction. The court held that the statute limiting the location of the erection of billboards was a constitutional delegation of power to the transportation department and was not vague. Furthermore, the court held that the minimum requirements for the erection of billboards were not unreasonable, the injunction was not issued prematurely because appellant began construction on the billboards, and the landowners neighboring the billboards were not indispensable parties. Finally, the court held that there was no evidence the commonwealth selectively enforced the statute limiting billboards. Therefore, the court held that the injunction preventing the erection of the billboards was proper and that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated appeal, appellant coal companies sought review of decisions of Court of Appeals (Kentucky) which affirmed workers' compensation awards to appellee employees for retraining incentive benefits based on occupational diseases, on ground that Ky.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee employees were awarded retraining incentive benefits in their workers' compensation claims based on occupational disease incurred in appellants' coal mines, despite the contrary testimony of university medical evaluators of such claims, where Ky.

The court held that, regardless of the filing date of the claims, the statutes applied to appellees' claims because they were pending on or after the statutes' effective date, and the statutes created a rebuttable presumption that the evaluators' testimony constituted substantial evidence of appellees' medical conditions. However, with the exception of one claim, the fact-finder properly disregarded such testimony by specifically stating reasonable bases for finding appellees' medical evidence to be more probative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant minor rejected coverage of workers' compensation laws and filed a tort claim against appellee employer for work-related injuries. The trial court granted appellee's summary judgment motion based on the waiver of tort rights and exclusivity provisions under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 342.395, 342.690. Appellant argued that illegal employment invalidated implied consent under &sect; 342.395; minors were excluded from workers' compensation time limitations; the implied waiver of tort remedies was unconstitutional; and workers' compensation benefits were inequitable. The court held that &sect; 342.395 coverage applied regardless of the legality of employment conditions and appellant was not restricted by time limitations due to the opportunity to bring a workers' compensation action through his parents. Failure to reject workers' compensation coverage before the accident constituted an implied waiver of the right of rejection and automatic payment of medical bills provided assured benefits under workers' compensation laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Commonwealth appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (Kentucky), vacating the judgment of the Lee Circuit Court on the grounds that the appeal from the ruling that the definition of marijuana in Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 218A.010(12) was unconstitutionally overbroad, was taken from a nonfinal order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee actor planted hemp seeds and he was cited for possession of marijuana, Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 218A.1422 (1998). He moved to dismiss the charge, arguing that seeds did not come within the statutory definition of marijuana, or, alternatively, that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. After hearing to the bench, the judge determined that the statute was constitutionally defective. The trial judge further determined that the amendment to Ky. Rev. Stat. &sect; 218A.010(9) had no rational basis, and thus, violated Ky. Const. &sect; 2. The Court of Appeals remanded with directions to dismiss the appeal, holding that the appeal was taken from nonfinal orders. The court reversed, holding, inter alia: that the district court exceeded its authority by improperly adding language to a statute and then, finding it unconstitutional, and that district court's decision was clearly erroneous, in part because of the presumption of constitutionality of a statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decisions of the court of appeals, the circuit court, and the district court were reversed and the matter was remanded to the district court for trial or other appropriate action because the lower courts erred in concluding that the possession of marijuana statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded for resentencing determining that &sect; 532.043 as applied to appellant was an ex post facto law because (1) it was retrospective since the possibility of a post-release conditional discharge did not exist prior to the effective date of the law, and appellant pled guilty before the law's effective date, and (2) appellant was disadvantaged by being subjected to the possibility of serving an additional three years imprisonment beyond the maximum sentence to which he was subject when the offenses were committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sued for a refund of business license taxes paid pursuant to city ordinance, which was voided because it was improperly enacted. The lower courts held that the provisions of Ky. Rev. Stat.

The court found that the ordinance imposed mandatory sanctions for failure to timely pay the annual license fee. Thus, the plaintiffs paid the tax involuntarily. The court held that the plaintiffs' claims could properly be characterized as claims for recovery of damages for wrongfully withholding personal property under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 413.120(5), or actions for injuries to the rights of plaintiffs not arising under contract and not otherwise enumerated under &sect; 413.120(7).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While serving time on a five-year sentence, appellant was convicted of manslaughter and assault. Although the trial judge ordered a ten-year sentence to be served consecutively with the previous five year sentence appellant was already serving, the written judgment made no mention of the consecutive provision, and appellant's release time was calculated as if the sentences were concurrent. Appellant sought relief of the order amending the written sentence. The court affirmed the modification, finding that appellant was not subject to double jeopardy due to the sentence change. The court held that the written order was a clerical mistake, subject to modification. The court found that appellant was present in court and heard the judge's sentence, and therefore, did not possess the legitimate expectation that the error was beyond correction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the modification to appellant's criminal sentence because the difference between the oral order and the written sentence was a mere clerical error.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 533.030(3) and 532.350(1) because it did not suffer direct pecuniary damages as a result of defendant's criminal activity but voluntarily accepted the county's request for assistance; [2]-Because the ASPCA could have declined to voluntarily participate in the recovery of defendant's dogs, it was not a victim for purposes of Ky. Rev. Stat. Chapters 532 and 533; [3]-Defendant did not demonstrate that Rowan County, Ky., Code of Ordinances Section 93.07 violated the constitutional prohibition against absolute and arbitrary power, Ky. Const. &sect; 2, because the discretion granted to the judge executive was reasonably related to the fiscal court's statutory authority to control animals and abate public nuisances.</SPAN></P>
