Alaska Psychiatric Inst. because they provided for an expedited process that was appropriately protective of appellant's liberty interests and that avoided unnecessarily prolonging his emergency detention; [2]-The record showed that the State complied with the statutory requirements for emergency detention and evaluation and that appellant would have received a post-deprivation hearing with extensive procedural protections within the time required by statute had a commitment petition been filed; [3]-A pre-evaluation hearing with appointed counsel would have provided little additional benefit to appellant.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 7 cannot allow that interest to be furthered by barring an individual prisoner's court access because of an actual inability to pay; [3]-As applied to prisoners in the prisoner's circumstances, AS 09.19.010 denies adequate procedural due process; [4]-AS 09.19.010 expressly provides that if timely payment is not made, the court may not accept any filing, and such mandatory language precludes the court from ruling that Alaska courts have a common law authority to waive prisoner litigation filing fees in their entirety.</SPAN></P>

VI, rights. Although defendant asserted that the entry of default made it impossible for him to hire an attorney in the civil case, he never asserted in the civil case that he could not afford an attorney in the criminal case and he never argued to the judge that her refusal to set aside the default judgment violated his Sixth Amendment rights in the criminal case.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held the lieutenant governor properly refused to certify it because (1) he could refuse to certify an initiative if controlling authority showed its unconstitutionality, and (2) it was clearly unconstitutional under controlling authority barring states from banning all abortions. Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1 did not require the state to outlaw abortion because (1) the U.S. Supreme Court held &quot;person,&quot; as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, did not include the unborn, so, even if a state had a constitutional duty to protect all persons' natural right to life, that duty did not extend to the unborn, and (2) the Alaska Constitution could not guarantee the unborn limitless protections as Roe v. Wade barred such guarantees that would broadly ban abortions. The citizen was not improperly denied a jury trial because the question before the trial court was purely legal. The trial court did not improperly refuse to order counsel and the court to produce proof of their law licenses because counsel's bar membership number on their pleadings, pursuant to Alaska R. Civ. P. 76, sufficiently proved they were authorized to practice law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held the worker was entitled to a full award of reasonable attorney's fees because Alaska R. App. P. 508(g)(2)'s policy considerations, awarding full fees to a successful claimant in an administrative appeal from the Alaska Workers' Compensation Appeals Commission (Commission), included appeals from a trial court to establish &quot;project owner&quot; status under AS 23.30.045, as there was no reason not to apply the policy that a successful claimant should recover a full fee for reasonable costs of appeal, since different rules should not apply before a trial court and the Commission. Smith v. State did not bar an award because (1) Crawford &amp; Co. v. Vienna undercut its authority, and (2) Crawford &amp; Co. v. Vienna governed, as the worker's claim was not unreasonable, frivolous, or in bad faith, and there was uncertainty in procedure and coverage when no workers' compensation coverage was in place to cover his injuries and he sought to foreclose on a workers' compensation lien for only those benefits. An award did not expand Alaska R. App. P. 508(g)(2) after the fact, denying the owners their property without notice, because they had constructive notice of an award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the child support order erroneously indicated he was in arrears the day it was granted. The supreme court noted that while appellee Stat of Alaska, Department of Revenue, Child Support Services Division 's (CSSD) October notice letter mentioned an effective date of the first date of the following month, the father was on notice that the mother could pursue child support effective September 17. The father had an adequate opportunity to anticipate the modification and minimize prejudice. The January 14, 2011 child support order was upheld and it was appropriate for arrears to extend to the September 17 effective date. The father's challenge to the arrears was without merit. Because there was little probability of success on the motion for reconsideration, denying the stay was proper. The father's constitutional arguments did not rise to the level of plain error. The orders concerning the custody proceedings were not appealable final judgments and the supreme court was not persuaded that the father had raised issues outweighing the sound policy behind requiring appeals to be taken only from a final judgment. The petition for review was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant union challenged a decision of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, holding that its equitable jurisdiction was constrained by the Anchorage Municipal Code, which had no provision for imposing the arbitrator's decision, and entered an order permanently enjoining a strike and allowing appellee municipality to implement its last best offer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality contended that a strike by union employees of any duration would have immediately posed an unacceptable threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. The union consistently agreed with the municipality on this point throughout the litigation. In addition, the municipality and the union agreed that both parties had negotiated in good faith and otherwise met their obligations under the Anchorage Municipal Code's (AMC's) Employee Relations chapter. Therefore issuance of a permanent injunction was proper pursuant to Anchorage, Alaska, Mun. Code 03.70.110.B. The union's argument that the superior court should have imposed the arbitrator's decision as a condition of a permanent injunction to compensate for taking away the union's right to strike was rejected because the superior court's equitable jurisdiction was constrained by the AMC. The AMC had no provision for imposing the arbitrator's decision. As a result, the superior court properly entered an order permanently enjoining the strike and allowing the municipality to implement its last best offer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate said furlough conditions not in his sentence violated his constitutional rights. The supreme court disagreed because AS 33.30.101(a) and AS 33.30.111(c) and Alaska Admin. Code tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 05.316 and 05.321 mandated the conditions despite a sentence. Conditions imposed by Alaska Admin. Code tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 05.316 and 05.321 did not exceed the Department of Corrections' authority because the regulations were consistent with AS 33.30.101 and AS 33.30.111, as (1) the statutes allowed furlough policies, and (2) the regulations reasonably implemented the statutes. Furlough condition laws were not ex post facto punishment, nor did they trigger double jeopardy, because (1) enacting the furlough statute after the inmate's sentencing was more favorable, and (2) a furlough was not punishment. The laws did not violate due process as applied because (1) he had no federal interest in a furlough, as its denial did not extend his sentence or newly restrain his freedom, and (2) the denial created no atypical prison hardship. The laws did not facially violate Alaska due process because he did not claim denial of fair consideration or imposition of conditions for an improper purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was shot and killed with a rifle obtained from the owner's gun store. The superior court held that the owner was entitled to immunity under the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 7901-7903. The court held that the superior court correctly interpreted the PLCAA as barring general negligence actions against gun sellers pursuant to 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 7902(a), 7903(5)(A). Because the PLCAA was not ambiguous, the doctrine of constitutional avoidance was inapplicable. The PLCAA did not violate Alaska's sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. X, because it did not compel state action. There was no separation of powers violation because the PLCAA was not retroactively applied to a pending case. The PLCAA did not infringe on the constitutional right of access to the courts, nor did it eliminate all potential common law remedies. The PLCAA did not violate equal protection. A factual dispute as to how the shooter obtained the rifle precluded summary judgment as to a claim of negligence per se based on knowing violations of federal firearms dealing requirements under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 922, 924, and as to a claim of negligent entrustment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's rulings on the PLCAA's construction and constitutionality, while remanding the remainder of the superior court's decision on summary judgment for further consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objectors filed a lawsuit to challenge the Board's negative customary and traditional use finding for a fishery. The superior court found that the regulation was valid and constitutional, but remanded the case to the Board for an articulation of the standard being used. The superior court instructed the Board not to consider the per capital consumption of wild food on remand. On remand, the Board upheld its previous classification. This appeal followed. In partially affirming, the supreme court determined that Alaska Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 99.010(b) was consistent with its authorizing statutes; moreover, it was reasonable and not arbitrary. The Board was permitted to consider the cultural, social, and economic context in which the harvest took place. Next, Alaska Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 99.010(b) did not violate the equal access provision under Alaska Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 3, 15, 17. Finally, the Board's application of Alaska Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 99.010(b) was proper in this case, and the Board was allowed to take into consider the per capita consumption of wild foods in the users' home communities when applying the regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the superior court's denial of his child custody and visitation motions showed it was prejudiced against him. The Supreme Court of Alaska disagreed, because judicial bias could not be inferred merely from adverse rulings. The father did not demonstrate that his constitutional rights were violated by the initial loss of custody, the denial of his motions to modify custody under Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.20.110(a), or the restrictions on his visitation rights. The mother did not violate a court order by denying the father his telephonic visitations; because he missed more than three consecutive visitations, the court order no longer applied. Thus, the superior court did not err in declining to hold the mother in contempt. The superior court did not err by denying the father's motions for visitation and to modify child custody, because he did not comply with the court's order for a psychological evaluation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appraisal based the lease price on the fair market value of the state land, without reduction for rights retained by the state or granted to others. The court found the Department's interpretation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 38.35.140(a) to be reasonable and consistent with the broad definition of state land in Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 38.35.230(9)(C), 38.05.965(21). Under the plain language of &sect; 38.35.140(a), the basis for calculating the lease price was the fair market rental value of the state's interest in the land included in the right-of-way, not the leasehold interest granted to the lessee. Moreover, Alaska Stat. &sect; 38.35.120(a)(12) protected the right-of-way from third-party interference, and there was no indication that third-party interests had affected the value. The interpretation was not a regulation as defined in Alaska Stat. &sect; 44.62.640(a)(3) and thus was not subject under Alaska Stat. &sect; 38.35.190 to the notice and public comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 44.62.010-44.62.950. Absent evidence of a federal claim of title to submerged lands within the right-of-way, the Department was not required to prove the state's title to the submerged lands.</SPAN></P>

Thus, there was no live controversy to decide, and any opinion issued on the validity of the regulations would be merely advisory. As the State did not appeal the trial court's grant of attorney's fees, it remained liable to pay the organization's fees. The trial court erred in granting the resident attorney's fees; though he had a law degree, as he was not admitted to practice law in Alaska, he was not entitled to an award of fees under &sect; 09.60.010(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant power companies challenged a decision from the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, a quasi-independent governmental agency, its employees, and a competitor, in an action alleging, inter alia, misappropriation of trade secrets, and tortious interference with an economic advantage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was alleged that the agency erroneously awarded contracts for power generation and that its employees improperly disclosed trade secrets to a competitor. The trial court granted summary judgment for the agency, and this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court held that the decision in a previous case was not a judgment on the merits that supported the application of collateral estoppel here. Qualified immunity applied in this case; there had to be a showing of bad faith, malice, corruption, or other outrageous conduct in order for the claims to survive summary judgment. This showing was only made as to one of the agency employees. A claim for intentional interference with a prospective economic advantage was properly dismissed because there was no showing of an expectation to enter into a contract, but for the interference. To the extent that it was alleged that a trade secret covered the general use of, or access to, a controller, the claim failed. The evidence did not show either an improper acquisition under Alaska Stat. &sect; 45.50.940(2)(B)(i) or that the competitor knew or had reason to know that it had received and used a trade secret under &sect; 45.50.940(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2009, appellant, a career Marine Corps officer, and his children applied for permanent fund dividends from the State. They were denied because appellant had been absent for 10 consecutive years from the enactment of the 10-year rule in Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.23.008(c) (1998). The trial court upheld the denial. On appeal, appellant argued that the 10-year rule violated his equal protection and substantive due process rights. The court held that the 10-year rule was fairly and substantially related to the legitimate interests of limiting dividends to permanent Alaska residents and preventing fraud. The 10-year rule did not unconstitutionally distinguish between Alaska residents absent for 10 years and Alaska residents absent for fewer than 10 years. The 10-year rule was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of reducing the administrative burden of processing dividend applications. While the 10-year rule might seem to disparage the value and honor of those who served the nation and the sacrifices made by their families, it did not violate equal protection. A statute that met the higher equal protection standard always satisfied the demands of substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2010, appellant ex-wife petitioned for an ex parte and long-term protective order against appellee ex-husband. The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, Alaska, denied the petition, concluding that service of process on the ex-wife in a forcible entry and detainer (FED) action did not constitute a violation of a 2009 domestic violence protective order. The ex-wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-wife contended that the filing of the FED action was a violation of the 2009 protective order and therefore constituted a &quot;crime involving domestic violence,&quot; upon which a new protective order could be granted. The court concluded that it was not a violation of a protective order to file a lawsuit, particularly given the factual finding that the ex-husband's filing of the FED action was not intended to either intimidate or harass the ex-wife. To rule otherwise would have required the court to address whether Alaska Stat. &sect; 18.66.100 violates an individual's constitutional right to access the courts. If the filing of the FED action was a violation of anything, it was a violation of the terms of the parties' settlement agreement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DOT&amp;PF managed the lake as a float plane facility. After conducting a noise study, DOT&amp;PF issued a use plan setting forth rules for recreational and aircraft users. The association alleged that the plan violated the protected common use of and free access to public waters under Alaska Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 3, 14. The court held that the allegations of constitutional violations and public nuisance constituted a sufficient injury to the interests of the association's members, or at least its riparian landowner members, to establish associational standing. Moreover, the association sought to protect interests germane to its purpose of preserving lake access and use, and its claims raised mostly questions of law. The use plan was not a regulation as defined in Alaska Stat. &sect; 44.62.640(a)(3) or a noise compatibility program under Alaska Admin. Code tit. 17, &sect; 45.140 (2009) but interpreted existing regulations; thus, Alaska Administrative Procedure Act compliance under Alaska Stat. &sect; 44.62.280, 44.62.190, 44.62.210, 44.62.040 was not required.

The licensee requested an administrative hearing in each case. Based on the convictions of certain employees, the ALJ concluded that the licensee did not overcome the statutory presumption of negligence in Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.70.075(w). The superior court rejected the licensee's constitutional arguments. The court affirmed after considering the amended statute. The revised statute, in &sect; 43.70.075(m)(5) and (w), created a rebuttable presumption that a licensee could overcome with respect to an employee's conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the Third Judicial District, Kenai, Alaska, granted partial summary judgment to appellant organization and partial summary judgment in favor of appellee borough on the organization's lawsuit against the borough requesting a court declaration that the initiatives applied to candidates chosen in the October 2007 election and that the seats held by the five incumbents were vacant. The organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization appealed the superior court's decision not to name a prevailing party and argued that it should have been named the prevailing party. The supreme court found that the three issues identified by the superior court constituted main issues. All three issues were decided on distinct legal grounds. Because the organization succeeded on the question whether Proposition 2 was valid, and the borough succeeded on the questions whether Proposition 2 applied to the October 2007 election and whether Proposition 3 was valid, the superior court's decision that neither party was the prevailing party was reasonable and therefore not an abuse of discretion. The local initiative power was statutory and not constitutional in origin. Thus, the organization did not assert a constitutional right that would entitle it to attorney's fees under Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.60.010(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers' group sought review of a decision from the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Kenai (Alaska), which, on summary judgment, rejected their challenge to appellee borough's sales tax ordinance and ruled that a capital projects voter approval requirement was an unconstitutional use of initiative power. The borough cross-appealed the denial of prevailing party attorney's fees on the capital projects approval issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borough enacted an ordinance that increased the sales tax rate from two percent to three percent. Although borough voters previously had authorized a sales tax not to exceed three percent, the rate had been two percent for many years. An initiative proposition made prior voter approval a requirement for the borough to construct or acquire capital projects in excess of a specified cost. Interpreting the borough's power to impose a sales tax under Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.45.650(a) in favor of the broad power of municipal governments, the court held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.45.670 did not require voter ratification of the sales tax ordinance because there was no increase from the rate previously authorized. The court concluded that the voter approval requirement violated Alaska Const. art. XI, &sect; 7 and Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.26.100 because it sufficiently narrowed the borough's ability to make allocation decisions to render it an appropriation of municipal funds. The taxpayers' group was not a constitutional litigant and thus was not protected under Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.60.010(c)(2) from an award of attorney's fees because the local initiative power was statutory rather than constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grants of summary judgment and reversed the constitutional litigant determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife challenged an order of the Superior Court of the Third Judicial District, Anchorage, Alaska, that awarded custody of her children to appellee husband, arguing that the superior court failed to properly consider evidence concerning domestic violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court held that the superior court's determination that it was in the children's best interests to be placed in their father's custody was supported by the record, which showed that the parties' daughter had special needs resulting from a neurological disorder and that the husband was more capable of meeting those needs. The trial court correctly ruled that the presumption under Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.24.150(g) against awarding custody to the husband was triggered by his two acts of domestic violence against his wife but erred in interpreting Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.24.150(h) as providing only one way to rebut the presumption. The plain language &quot;where reasonably available&quot; supported the conclusion that the legislature did not intend that completion of a batterers' intervention program was the only way to overcome the rebuttable presumption in subsection (g). The plain language of subsection (h) indicated that completion of a batters' intervention was one way, but not the only way, to overcome the statutory presumption. The rebuttable presumption in Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.24.150(g) could be overcome by means other than the completion of an intervention program for batterers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the superior court to determine whether the husband rebutted the presumption under Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.24.150(g), which established a statutory presumption against awarding custody to one who had committed acts of domestic violence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state agency challenged a judgment from the Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska), which, after a bench trial, awarded appellees, a class of nonresident holders of commercial fishing permits and licenses, a refund of excessive fees and prejudgment interest thereon. The superior court awarded attorney's fees under the schedule in Alaska R. Civ. P. 82(b)(1) for cases involving money judgments contested with a trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with the court's previous mandate, the superior court applied the prejudgment interest rate for underpayments and overpayments of taxes under Alaska Stat. tit. 43, as set forth in Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 43.05.280, 43.05.225(a). The court declined to apply the law of the case doctrine, concluding that its previous holding on the rate of prejudgment interest was incorrect and had produced a manifestly unjust result. The interest rate provided by &sect; 43.05.280(a) applied only to overpayment of taxes levied under Alaska Stat. tit. 43, but the fees at issue had been imposed under Alaska Stat. tit. 16. Under the circumstances, recovery was not limited to Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.10.210; rather, the suit was to be treated as a common law action in assumpsit, as to which an award of prejudgment interest against the State was governed by Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 09.30.070, 09.50.280, 09.50.250. Even if the trial could be characterized as an evidentiary hearing, a Rule 82 award was permissible. The superior court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the class was the prevailing party and entitled to attorney's fees because it obtained a refund, although the State prevailed on some issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed its previous holding as to the proper rate of prejudgment interest and remanded for the superior court to determine a new interest award and to adjust the fee award accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was treated for work-related injuries and her claims for benefits were resolved. She later restarted treatment for her arm and wrist pain and for depression. The employee alleged that her work exacerbated her conditions. The Supreme Court of Alaska upheld the Board's decision that she did not prove her claim by a preponderance of the evidence. There was little evidence in the record tying her ganglion cyst to her work. The employer's independent medical evaluation report and a doctor's testimony provided substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that the medial epicondylitis was not work related. The neurological diagnoses were largely based on the employee's reports, and she was not a credible witness. The Board gave more weight to a doctor's opinion that the employee was malingering and did not suffer from an injury-related mood disorder. Because the employee did not develop her constitutional challenge to Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.122, it was deemed waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals of the State of Alaska that reversed a trial court order denying defendant's motion to suppress, arguing that the appellate court erred in concluding that the emergency aid exception to the general requirement that a search warrant be obtained prior to police entry into a residence did not apply to excuse the warrantless police entry at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police responded to a residence following a report of a domestic disturbance involving a knife. A woman exited upon their arrival, and defendant exited upon their order. Although the woman denied that anyone else was in the trailer, she was uncooperative, and the officers were uncertain whether any other people were involved. The police entered the residence and found that a methamphetamine lab inside. Defendant was indicated on four counts related to the manufacture of methamphetamine. He moved to suppress, challenging the warrantless entry into the residence. The trial court denied the suppression motion, but the appellate court reversed. On review, the court held that the emergency exception to the warrant requirement applied because the police could not rely upon the woman's statement that no one else was inside based upon their experience that people in domestic violence situations often lie and because they entered the home to ensure that no one else was injured and in need of aid. It was enough that the police had good reason to believe there might be, as opposed to knowing that there actually was, someone injured inside of the residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals' decision was reversed. Because the court of appeals stopped its consideration of defendant's appeal after considering only the applicability of the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement, the case was remanded to the court of appeals for consideration of the remainder of defendant's issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that nothing in the language of the legislative history of the project owner provision, Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.045, suggested that the legislature meant to exclude the State and its political subdivisions from the definition of &quot;project owner.&quot; In appropriate circumstances &quot;person&quot; could include the State and its political subdivisions. The municipality would not be a &quot;project owner&quot; if it entered into a contract with a vendor whose primary business was leasing equipment, but Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.045(d) would still require it to ensure that the vendor had workers' compensation coverage. Sections 23.30.045(d) and (f) did not conflict, and the municipality could be a &quot;project owner&quot; under &sect; 23.30.045(f)(2). The employer's controversion did not leave the worker to his common law remedies. If an employer could not use the exclusive remedy defense in a case, neither could the project owner or contractor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross-appeals were taken from a judgment of the Superior Court, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks (Alaska), which, in a jury trial, awarded damages under the Alaska Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act (UTPA), Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 45.50.471-45.50.561, to appellee electric association and determined that appellant construction contractor was not entitled to damages with regard to its contract, common law tort, and UTPA claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into two construction contracts. A dispute arose as to whether the contractor was entitled to additional compensation. The court held that an objection to a jury instruction satisfied Alaska R. Civ. P. 51(a), although the contractor did not again formally object just before final instructions were given. The disputed instruction, based on Alaska case law, was proper because the consideration of federal law mandated by Alaska Stat. &sect; 45.50.545 in interpreting the UTPA did not require that Alaska precedent be disregarded where changes in the federal approach conflicted with Alaska law. The electric association could not recover damages under the UTPA for its legal expenses incurred in the litigation. A new trial on the contractor's breach of contract claim was necessary because uncontradicted evidence established that the contractor sustained some damage; thus, a finding of no legal causation was plainly unreasonable and unjust. A new fee determination under Alaska Stat. &sect; 45.50.537(a) was necessary. The electric association's Alaska R. Civ. P. 68 offer of judgment was insufficient because it offered merely dismissal with prejudice, not entry of judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the award of pre-litigation compensatory damages under the UTPA to the electric association, vacated the remainder of the verdict, and remanded for a fee determination regarding the electric association's UTPA claim and for a new trial on causation and damages arising from the contractor's claim for breach of the second contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An elderly mother requiring long-term medical care gave $120,000 to her son in February 2007. By the time she applied for Medicaid in September 2008, the Alaska legislature had enacted Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.07.020(m), which rendered her ineligible for benefits because she had transferred her assets. The Alaska Department of Health &amp; Social Services Division of Public Assistance was not equitably estopped from denying her application for Medicaid benefits. The Supreme Court of Alaska held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.07.020(m) was a valid retroactive statute. The State did not violate her equal protection or due process rights. The Division's choice of August 1, 2007, as the effective date for the new rule had a rational relation to the government's goal in implementing the penalty start date as soon as practicably possible. The mother received notice and an opportunity to be heard. Preemption was not an issue, as there was no conflict between federal and state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bar owner was convicted of violating borough noise and adult entertainment ordinances. Appellee borough protested continued operation under the bar owner's liquor license. The ABC Board denied the bar owner's continued operation under his liquor license. The superior court did not err by affirming the ABC Board's decision because the borough's protest was filed by its director. Under Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.20.400(a), the borough could delegate its protest power to a department head. The borough's extensive and continuing support ratified the director's protest. The bar owner's due process rights were not violated at the administrative hearing due to Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.11.480's burden-shifting regime. The borough took on and successfully carried the burden of persuasion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An 11-year-old girl was driving an ATV dangerously through city streets. When an officer signaled her to stop, she refused, first trying to escape on the ATV and then fleeing on foot. When the officer caught up to the girl, she stopped running, and although she was never aggressive toward the officer, he tasered her twice. Subsequently, the girl's mother filed suit on her daughter's behalf, alleging excessive force. On review of summary judgment, the court held that the superior court erred in granting the officer qualified immunity because the use of a taser multiple times on an 11-year-old girl who was suspected of traffic violations, was compliant, and was not posing a threat to the officer or others could constitute conduct so egregious that any reasonable officer would have known that the conduct was an excessive use of force. Summary judgment was improper because there were factual disputes regarding whether, among other things, the girl was fully compliant and had ceased her efforts to flee. Those disputed material facts had to be resolved at trial before the egregiousness of the officer's conduct and his entitlement to qualified immunity could be determined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court's summary judgment grant of qualified immunity to defendant police officer was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a private club and its members, challenged an ordinance banning smoking in private clubs, City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska, Code &sect; 36.60. The Supreme Court of Alaska upheld the ordinance. Because the smoking ban regulated only conduct, it did not implicate the freedom of association protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. The smoking ban did not violate appellants' right to privacy under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 22, because private clubs did not enjoy privacy protections afforded in the home. As smoking tobacco was not a fundamental right of personal autonomy, strict scrutiny did not apply.

The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, Alaska, granted summary judgment for the State on all counts. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to plaintiff's discrimination claim, the court concluded that plaintiff could not meet the first part of the three-part McDonnell Douglas test. Although plaintiff asserted his own qualifications in a deposition, he did not provide performance reviews or other materials to corroborate that claim. Although plaintiff alleged because he was adversely affected by the decision to terminate his employment, plaintiff could not demonstrate that employees outside his protected class were treated more favorably. Because plaintiff did not establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination, he could not claim that a state agency breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by racially discriminating against him. With respect to plaintiff's claim a state agency breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by falsely accusing him of theft, the court noted that plaintiff admitted taking a fuel tank stand. Even if the agency was in fact mistaken about the theft of the fuel, plaintiff did not adduce facts reasonably permitting an inference that the agency's investigation was unfair or conducted in bad faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alaska Supreme Court held that the resident had standing to assert a &sect; 1983 claim.

As a result, the resident alleged that she did not refresh or modify her roof paintings. She articulated enough of an injury to confer interest-injury standing. The court also held that the resident's counterclaim should have survived a motion to dismiss because it alleged a set of facts consistent with stating a claim that her speech--a message displayed on private property--was protected and that the application of the ordinance to her did not serve any significant governmental interest, given the government's initial position that the ordinance did not apply to her sign at all and the trial court's finding that it applied only to commercial signs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The objector's notice of appeal stated that he frequented a public beach adjacent to the proposed site and that he owned land that could be adversely affected.

After issuing a decision upholding the city clerk's ruling, the superior court issued a final judgment several months later dismissing the case and awarding fees and costs. The objector filed an appeal one week after the date of the final judgment. The court held that the appeal was untimely under Alaska R. App. P. 204(a)(1) because the final judgment requirement of Alaska R. Civ. P. 58 was inapplicable where the superior court acted as an intermediate appellate court. Pursuant to Alaska R. App. P. 507(a), 601(c), the decision was the judgment from which the time to appeal was calculated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After evaluating appellant, a psychiatrist at API petitioned for a 30-day commitment. The psychiatrist stated that appellant had a history of bipolar I disorder and had been hospitalized at API three times in the previous month. The trial court granted the petition. On appeal, the court concluded that although appellant's claims were moot, the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine applied because she presented a question of statutory interpretation that was capable of repetition. The trial court properly applied Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.30.735(c) when it granted the commitment petition based on appellant's condition at the time of the hearing and considered her recent symptoms and behavior in making that determination. It was determined that appellant was gravely disabled, as defined in Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.30.915(7), on the day of the commitment hearing. Appellant could not properly access outpatient treatment while her thinking was so impaired, and without further treatment she would likely be hospitalized again.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sued governmental defendants for failing to challenge the constitutionality of 1995 legislation that modified jurisdiction regarding excessive sentence appeals. The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, Alaska, dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that plaintiff's claims for damages were precluded by collateral estoppel. Prior litigation conclusively established that plaintiff was not injured by the 1995 law. Plaintiff would have been unable to appeal his sentence as excessive under either the pre-1995 version of Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.120(a) or the post-1995 version. A ruling that plaintiff was not injured by the 1995 legislation barred plaintiff from further lawsuits based on harm arising from the alleged unconstitutionality of the legislation. To the extent that plaintiff's declaratory judgment claims were not barred by collateral estoppel, they were barred by the State's discretionary immunity. The government acts plaintiff challenged involved the performance of a &quot;discretionary function&quot; within the meaning of the Alaska Tort Claims Act (ATCA). Any decision by defendants not to challenge the 1995 law was a policy judgment on the merits of the 1995 law. Defendants' decision was therefore discretionary within the meaning of the ATCA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tribes brought an action against appellants, seeking declaratory relief recognizing that Alaska Native tribes possessed inherent and concurrent jurisdiction to adjudicate children's proceedings and issue tribal court decrees, and injunctive relief forcing the State and its agencies to grant full faith and credit to tribal court decrees as required by law. The trial court granted the tribes' motion for partial summary judgment, ruling that the tribes retained concurrent jurisdiction to legislate, initiate, and adjudicate child in need of aid cases in tribal courts. The trial court enjoined the State from denying full faith and credit to the tribes' determinations in Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA)-defined child custody proceedings. On appeal, the court held that federally recognized Alaska Native tribes that had not reassumed exclusive jurisdiction under 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1918(a) still had concurrent jurisdiction to initiate ICWA-defined child custody proceedings, both inside and outside of Indian country. The court did not have before it sufficient facts to make determinations about specific limitations on inherent tribal jurisdiction over ICWA-defined child custody proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court properly granted the school district summary judgment on the employee's age discrimination claim because he no first-hand knowledge that a younger person was hired in his place, as his testimony was hearsay from an unnamed source.

VIII, &sect; 4 and the sustained yield mandate in Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.255--Alaska's intensive game management statute. Appellants, conservation advocacy groups and individual, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the Board failed to consider and apply the principle of sustained yield to its management of wolves and bears affected by predator control plans the Board established in 2006. The supreme court found nothing in the language of the sustained yield clause, Alaska Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4, suggesting that a distinction should be drawn between predator and prey populations for purposes of applying the sustained yield principle. The sustained yield clause applied to both predator and prey populations, including populations of wolves and bears. The management of wildlife resources may constitutionally include a selection between predator and prey populations. Based upon the text of Alaska's intensive management statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.255, the principle of sustained yield applied to predator populations but the management of wildlife resources may include a selection between predator and prey populations. Appellants did not show that the Board's 2006 predator control plans violated principles of sustained yield. The superior court properly denied the individual attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed as to the ruling that Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.255 did not apply to predator populations; the judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court found that the denial of defendant's suppression motion and his conviction was affirmed and he never established the illegitimacy of the search that resulted in his first conviction. Defendant never established his factual innocence of the charges for which he was convicted. Defendant's allegations of an illegal search could not justify expungement of his criminal record. Like U.S. Const. amend. II, the individual right to bear arms set out in Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 19 did not invalidate laws that restricted convicted felons' access to firearms. The superior court did not prevent defendant from filing a motion for reconsideration, Alaska R. Civ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee sponsors submitted the Parental Involvement Initiative (PNI), relating to notification of abortions performed on minors, and appellee lieutenant governor prepared a petition summary. Appellant opponents asserted that the summary was defective. The superior court (Alaska) enjoined the use of the summary but held that if specified facts were set out in a revised ballot summary, the initiative could be on the ballot. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alaska Supreme Court concluded that the PNI could be placed on the ballot without recirculating the petition, provided that the summary was corrected and that the Parental Consent Act, Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 18.16.010(a)(3), 18.16.020, and the enforcement provisions implicated by the PNI were made available to the voters. When faced with a statewide initiative petition circulated with a defective summary, a court had to consider the nature and magnitude of the misleading statement or omission, the likelihood and extent of petition-signer inadvertence, the hardship to sponsors from invalidating signatures, and the hardship to opponents from permitting it to go forward. Although the summary in the current case was deficient, particularly in omitting a felony provision for physician's violations, it was not as misleading as some other petitions and petition-signer inadvertence was unlikely or minimal. The omissions did not substantially misrepresent the essential nature of the PNI, and the hardship to the sponsors of invalidating the signatures would have been great. The court discerned little hardship to the opponents if a corrected summary was used as the ballot summary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's order to the extent the issues presented on the cross-appeals were addressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city employee who served as finance director for eight years resigned after learning the mayor was demoting her to senior accountant. She filed suit alleging a violation of her right to due process under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, a violation of the Alaska Whistleblower Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.90.100-.150, wrongful termination, and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The superior court granted summary judgment for the city on all claims. The Supreme Court of Alaska affirmed the summary judgment on the employee's &sect; 1983 claim, because she was an at-will employee and had no property interest in continued employment. As the employee did not make a report to a public body or participate in an investigation while employed, she had no whistleblower claim. But the employee presented sufficient admissible evidence to create genuine issues of material fact as to whether her demotion was wrongful; therefore, the superior court erred by granting summary judgment on the wrongful termination claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the Third Judicial District, Palmer, Alaska, dismissed appellant landowners' suit concerning a plat against appellees, borough and neighbors, by ruling that the constitutional claims were improper and that the remaining claims were time-barred. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the landowners could, and did, bring other claims under Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.40.190 and borough ordinances. The superior court properly dismissed their constitutional claims for damages. The landowners were not entitled to money damages for the alleged violations of their constitutional rights, but they could seek declaratory and injunctive relief. The two-year limitation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.070 and the one-year limitation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.090 applied. Because more than two years passed between the recording of the plat and the filing of the complaint, the dismissal of these claims as untimely was correct. The landowners were not subject to a continuing violation. Because the doctrine of equitable tolling may toll the statute of limitations on the claims in the landowners' amended complaint, it was an abuse of discretion to deny them leave to amend, Alaska R. Civ. P. 15(a). The superior court did not rule on the landowners' equitable estoppel argument. The landowners were entitled to an opportunity to prove this defense to the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed suit challenging the decision of the Local Boundary Commission (LBC) to approve a petition for incorporation of the Deltana Borough. The superior court denied her motion to stay the election. When voters overwhelmingly rejected the incorporation of the proposed borough, the superior court dismissed her lawsuit as moot. The Supreme Court of Alaska affirmed, because only declaratory relief was available to appellant on the claims presented to the superior court and the issues were not likely to escape judicial review. Appellant's complaints regarding the LBC's exclusion of minority groups from the incorporation process, insufficient distribution of informational documents, and reliance on a meeting closed to the public in making its decision were problems capable of repetition. Appellant's claim that the LBC violated the Open Meetings Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 44.62.310, by using information gathered during a private tour was moot. The court would not consider appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of the initiative before it was enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.

The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant court concluded that the Alaska Prison Litigation Reform Act (APLRA) barred the inmate's claim for reinstatement of gate money. The inmate had no statute-based property right in gate money. Although the inmate contended that a final settlement agreement (FSA) in a class action by inmates regarding prison conditions was a contract and that he had a contractual right to gate money, the FSA's language did not create a property right to prospective enforcement of the gate money provision. The FSA did not create a continuing claim of entitlement to gate money because it granted broad discretion to the trial court to terminate or modify its terms in response to changes in law and circumstances. The parties intended that trial court enforcement of the FSA would be flexible and responsive to future changes in law and circumstances. The inmate had no legitimate expectation that the trial court would never change or discontinue enforcement of the consent decree. The inmate's claim did not qualify for an APLRA exception. Any error in the trial court's failure to rule on the inmate's request for appointed counsel was harmless since the law did not entitle the inmate to counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor allegedly wrote 15 checks that were later dishonored. The affected checks were assigned to the debt collection agency. The debtor claimed that the UTPA was violated when the debt collection agency and its lawyers: (1) sued the debtor without first sending a written demand; (2) misrepresented to the court that the debtor was competent; and (3) applied for a default judgment without first informing the debtor's attorney. In its motion to dismiss, the debt collection agency alleged that the claims failed to state a claim. On appeal, the debtor argued that the UTPA covered unfair and deceptive debt-collection practices that occur in the context of litigation and contended that neither Noerr-Pennington, nor the petition clause on which that doctrine was based, immunized these practices. The supreme court concluded that the debtor's UTPA claims did not implicate the debt collection agency's petition clause rights and that any burden that might result if the debtor's lawsuit was successful could be imposed on the collection agency consistently with the federal and state constitutions.

The worker was an employee of an oil field services company, which paid worker's compensation benefits. After removal of the case to the federal district court, the oil company moved for summary judgment, arguing that the Alaska Workers' Compensation Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.001-.400 barred the worker's tort claims because the oil company was the worker's statutory employer and therefore immune from suit. As to the worker's equal protection claim, the worker's interests were economic, and the 2004 amendments to Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 23.30.045 and.055 (amend. 2004) were subject to minimum scrutiny. The state's objectives in enacting the legislation were legitimate. Further, the amendments had a fair and substantial relationship to the state's objectives. The worker's equal protection rights were not violated. The 2004 amendments did not violate the worker's due process rights because the worker's right to access the courts, under Alaska Const. art.

The supreme court found that the proposed initiative would enact sweeping changes to present and future land use ordinances, including zoning, by imposing termination dates without any involvement by the planning commission or any consideration of consistency with the comprehensive plan. It would also impose termination dates on future amendments to the comprehensive plan without any planning commission input. The present case involved a general law municipality with legislative powers conferred by law, Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.04.020. The legislature's policy goals included marking the land use planning and regulation process with certainty, continuity, consistency, and comprehensiveness. The will of the people would be thwarted by the proposed initiative. The proponent could not be protected by Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.60.010(c)(2) from an award of attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks, Alaska, granted judgment in favor of appellee sponsors, by ruling that a proposed initiative relating to the regulation of large scale metallic mineral mines was constitutionally and statutorily permissible and could appear on the ballot. Appellants, a corporation, producers' council, and association, appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the initiative would violate the constitutional prohibition against initiatives that would appropriate public assets, would enact constitutionally impermissible special legislation, and was invalid because it summary and cost statements were defective. The supreme court found that the initiative dealt with public assets as the State had a property-like interest in the waters of Alaska, and the waters played a revenue-raising function. The initiative prohibited only &quot;adverse&quot; effects. If section two of the initiative was read to preclude only discharges of toxic chemicals and other mine wastes that caused adverse effects to humans, salmon, and waters used for human consumption or as salmon habitat, then it would not make an appropriation. The initiative was of general statewide applicability and was not prohibited special or local legislation, and bore a fair and substantial relationship to legitimate state purposes. The summary statement provided an accurate depiction of the scope and substance of the initiative. The cost statement provided an accurate estimate of the likely insignificant costs associated with implementation of the initiative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city sued appellant dog owner to enforce a city ordinance. The dog owner applied for a use permit. The city denied the dog owner's permit application and she appealed. After consolidating her permit appeal with the city's enforcement action, the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Palmer, denied the dog owner's appeal and granted the city summary judgment in its enforcement action. The dog owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dog owner raised dogs on property she owned in the city. City ordinances applicable to the property prohibited keeping more than three dogs without a permit. At issue on appeal was whether a use permit was reasonably denied. The dog owner first asserted that the city should be estopped from enforcing its use permit requirement because when she purchased the property, she reasonably relied on the city clerk's statement that she only needed a kennel license to operate a hobby kennel. The argument was unpersuasive, however, because it was not reasonable to rely on a government employee's statement that was at variance with the law. The dog owner also challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance; however, the city had a legitimate interest in controlling dog noise, dog odor, pollution, dog-caused diseases, and loose dogs. The three-dog limit was constitutional. The supreme court concluded that substantial evidence supported the commission's factual findings. Further, the commission had a reasonable basis for interpreting its ordinance as it did. As a result, the commission permissibly denied the dog owner's permit application. The city was entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The Alaska Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction upon concluding that the 2004 amendments survived all of defendant's constitutional challenges. Defendant petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court noted that the government may rest its case against a defendant solely on the evidence of a chemical test of at least 0.08 percent, though the jury need not infer that the chemical test result accurately reflected the defendant's blood alcohol content at the time of driving. But the adoption of Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(s) created an exception to the rule that competent evidence may be introduced to rebut the presumption and barred evidence of the consumption of alcohol before operating or driving that was introduced by the defendant as a defense that the chemical test did not measure the blood alcohol at the time of the operating or driving. The supreme court found that subsection (s)'s prohibition on delayed-absorption evidence in prosecutions under subsection (a)(1) that relied on chemical tests unjustifiably prevented defendants from introducing evidence that was both scientifically valid and directly relevant to the question of whether the defendant was impaired by alcohol at the time of driving. Because the jury convicted defendant using a general verdict form, it was not known whether he was found guilty under subsection (a)(1), subsection (a)(2), or both.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit to reform or invalidate a lease, which granted appellee lessee 20 acres to build a school for one dollar per year, subject to renegotiation after 10 years, and providing that this rate would remain effective if the parties could not reach mutual agreement upon renegotiation, appellant lessor sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, which granted summary judgment for the lessee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee, a school district, approached the lessor, a village corporation, with a proposed lease for a new public school. Although the lessor's attorney cautioned about the low payment rate and a possible conflict of interest from the fact that some of the lessor's board members were also on the school board, after a negotiation meeting, the lease was approved. On appeal, the court found that the chairman of the lessor's board had authority to sign the lease, and that it was reasonable for the lessee to rely on the apparent authority. There was mutual assent to all of the lease terms. As the lessor's chairman had apparent authority to sign the lease, Alaska Stat. &sect; 10.06.020 precluded the lessor from avoiding the contract due to the chairman's alleged failure to observe internal corporate procedures. The lease was supported by adequate consideration, and it was not unconscionable, particularly as the lessor was represented by experienced counsel. Reformation was properly denied because there was no showing of mistake since the lessor's shareholders knowingly accepted the lease rate after discussing the economic advantages of building a new school in the village.</SPAN></P>

The superior court imposed dram shop liability under Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.16.030 in favor of the representative, dismissed the bar's single shareholder from the lawsuit, and applied a single damages cap to the noneconomic damages awarded to the decedent's two surviving dependents. The supreme court affirmed except for the dismissal of the shareholder and remanded for a trial on the issue of piercing the corporate veil. The inferences presented satisfied several of the instrumentality factors and were sufficient to create a jury question on whether the bar was a mere instrument of the shareholder to the extent that the bar's corporate form should be disregarded. In part, the shareholder admitted that he paid employees with cash out of his personal pocket and although the shareholder testified that he received a $30,000 annual salary form the bar, it was not reflected on the corporate tax return for 1998.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DEC approved contingency plans for the oil shipping entities with respect to oil discharge.

The residents had a strong interest in accessing the record, and DEC had offered no valid governmental interest in denying access. The agency also erred by not explaining its calculations for preparation costs. The supreme court also concluded that the dismissal of the residents was an abuse of discretion because the agency easily could have reinstated the residents once they submitted payment for the record and because there was neither prejudice nor evidence of willfulness on the residents' part.</SPAN></P>

After the state legislature amended the act to exempt pilots from the act's overtime compensation provision, Alaska Stat. &sect; 23-10.060, the aviation company moved to dismiss. The superior court denied the motion, ruling that the amendment did not apply retroactively. The state legislature amended the act again, this time making the prior amendment retroactive.

He alleged that the trial court violated due process guarantees and that it erred in its findings that the API's proposed treatment was in his best interests and that no less intrusive alternative was available. Because the patient was subsequently released without treatment, the case was technically moot, but the supreme court determined that it fell within the public interest exception and concluded that, because the patient did not receive adequate notice of the nature of the proceedings and access to his medical chart, he was denied due process. The supreme court accordingly issued declaratory relief. In proceedings for involuntary administration of psychotropic medication in non-crisis situations, due process required that the petition provide sufficient information about the proposed treatment plan for the patient to prepare to challenge the petition under the Myers best interests factors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Alaska Public Offices Commission (APOC) imposed a civil penalty against appellee, a state senator, for failing to report certain income on his 2006 Legislative Financial Disclosure Statement (LFD) for calendar year 2005. The senator appealed to the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which reversed APOC's decision. APOC appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The senator joined a corporation's board of directors. He chose to defer his 2005 director compensation of $ 37,000 plus shares of common stock worth a similar amount, and he did not actually receive in hand any director compensation in 2005. On his 2006 LFD form, the senator disclosed his positions as director and shareholder but did not list the corporation as one of his sources of income over $ 5,000. The court held that the senator's right to deferred compensation became a valuable asset when he performed the services in 2005 and he received that asset in 2005. That asset was therefore income as defined in Alaska Stat. &sect; 24.60.990 (2006), which treated all assets that were received as subject to the disclosure requirements of former Alaska Stat. &sect; 24.60.200. However, APOC's instruction manual contained no instructions or examples for reporting deferred income, nor did it define &quot;received.&quot; The fact that the applicable statutes were clarified in 2007 supported the notion that the 2006 reporting requirements were indefinite and ambiguous. Therefore, the senator could not be subject to a penalty for failing to comply with them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's decision that APOC could not impose a civil penalty against the senator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former employee challenged a decision from the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Kenai, which awarded intervenor State a portion of punitive damages in a retaliatory discharge case involving appellee former employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a verdict, the State intervened to protect its interest in the punitive damages awarded. The employer and the employee entered into a settlement agreement after an appeal. The superior court calculated the punitive damages and ordered that half that amount be paid to the State after certain adjustments. The employee then sought review. Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.17.020 was interpreted to mean that, before a verdict was returned, the State was not permitted to intervene in a claim seeking punitive damages. However, once a verdict was returned, the State's interest in the punitive damages came into existence, and it was then allowed to intervene. The decision in the case when it was on appeal previously did not mean that the employee was then free to settle without recognizing the State's interest. Therefore, the State's interest that attached when the verdict was announced remained in effect. However, the post-judgment interest should have been set at the rate that was in effect at the time of the first judgment. Finally, a pro rata share of the employee's costs, in addition to attorney's fees, should have been deducted from the State's share of punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the superior court with instructions to modify the judgment by changing the post-judgment rate of interest on the judgment to 4.25% and by reducing the pro rata share of costs attributable to the State's portion of the award. Except for those changes, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents brought suit against defendants, school district and State, in the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, arising out of the requirement of Alaska Admin. Code tit. 7, &sect; 27.213, that their children submit to a skin test for tuberculosis. The parents argued that the test violated their religious and liberty interests. From a summary judgment rejecting these claims, they appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents registered their children for public school, but they failed to comply with Alaska Admin. Code tit. 7, &sect; 27.213, which required tuberculosis testing through a purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test. The parents argued that they had religious objections to introducing foreign, harmful substances into the body. The court held that the regulation was valid, neutral, and generally applicable and therefore did not violate the free exercise of religion clause, U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that the record provided no indication that the parents' feelings were connected to a comprehensive belief system, set of practices, or connection to ideas about fundamental matters. Without such assertions or evidence, summary judgment on the religious freedom issue under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 4. However, the court found that the parents had a privacy and liberty interest in their children's healthcare under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 22. The State had a compelling interest in preventing schoolchildren from spreading tuberculosis; but there was evidence that the State's interest could be met with the use of less intrusive testing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision with respect to the parents' regulatory and religious freedom claims, but remanded the case with instructions to determine whether the parents' fundamental right to make decisions about their children's medical treatment could be accommodated by other tests that were acceptable to them while also satisfying the compelling public health interests of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff legislators filed suit against defendants, two other legislators, a legislative committee, and an investigator, in the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, seeking to halt an investigation. The trial court denied plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction and dismissed their complaint. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Governor Sarah Palin dismissed the public safety commissioner. A committee of the Alaska Legislature initiated an investigation into the dismissal. Plaintiffs claimed that the investigation exceeded the legislature's power, violated separation of powers, exceeded the committee's authority, violated due process under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and violated statutory prohibitions related to conflicts of interest and unethical conduct. The court agreed with the trial court that plaintiffs did not have standing to bring their suit. Although they were not sham plaintiffs, there was evidence that others who were more directly affected had sued or were likely to sue. The governor, although engaged in a national political campaign, still had the ability to sue. That individuals who were more directly affected had chosen not to sue did not confer citizen-taxpayer standing on plaintiffs. More appropriate plaintiffs would have been witnesses in the investigation, targets of the investigation, or executive branch employees implicated in the commissioner's dismissal. Because plaintiffs alleged no plausible injury to their own interests, they also lacked interest-injury standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State and the organization argued that the supreme court should review the superior court's ripeness conclusion for an abuse of discretion. The supreme court disagreed and employed de novo review. Both the State and the organization argued that the organization's pre-enforcement challenge was ripe because the threat of enforcing Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.71.060(a) forced plaintiffs to either change their behavior or face the risk of criminal liability. The supreme court found that appellees did not have a strong claim of need for a pre-enforcement decision on the constitutionality of the amended statute because their current practices were and would remain illegal and expose them to a risk of criminal prosecution, regardless of any ruling the supreme court might make. The Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 844, criminalized appellees' personal, residential consumption of marijuana and imposed penalties that exceeded state sanctions. The hardships asserted by both named individuals did not require that the supreme court address the constitutionality of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.71.060. The amended statute was not unconstitutional in all its applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed the act allowing the University to select approximately 250,000 acres of land and providing all net income from such land to be placed in the University's endowment trust fund (ETF). The conservation groups challenged the act on the ground that it violated Alaska Const. art. IX, &sect; 7, by improperly dedicating state funds. The superior court held that the transfer of land and net proceeds from land under the act did not violate the dedicated funds clause and, in the alternative, that the University was exempt from that constitutional provision. The court concluded that the land grant provisions of the act committing proceeds from the granted lands to the ETF were unconstitutional under the dedicated funds clause. The University's land was state land and was not exempt from Alaska Const. art. IX, &sect; 7. The land grant provisions of the act were not severable, under the general savings clause of Alaska Stat. &sect; 01.10.030.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases, defendants were sentenced as second felony offenders--one on a finding of an aggravating factor in Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(c)(13) and the other on a finding of multiple former Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(c)(3) aggravating factors. Both defendants' Alaska R. Crim. P. 35(a) motions to apply Blakely retroactively were denied. The Court of Appeals (Alaska) held that Blakely was fully retroactive in Alaska. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Neither defendant's case was pending on direct review when Blakely was decided. The court had to interpret the federal and state constitutions and case law as to the retroactivity of appellate decisions. The issue was whether full retroactivity should be afforded to the Blakely ruling, which announced a new rule of law but did not automatically apply on collateral review. The court found that the clear and convincing standard applied to these defendants did not seriously diminish the accuracy of fact-finding when they were sentenced. Because the purpose of the rule announced in Blakely was not, under Rutherford, conclusive of full retroactivity, the court balanced the Judd factors and considered the purpose of Blakely's procedural rule, the reliance on the pre-Blakely rule, and the burden of full retroactive application of Blakely. The court concluded that Blakely did not merit full retroactive application under the Judd standard. Because Blakely was not fully retroactive, neither defendants' sentences nor the procedures used to impose the sentences were illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff hospital filed a complaint for injunctive relief against defendants, the Commissioner of Alaska's Department of Health and Social Services and a medical imaging facility, in the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks. The trial court granted the hospital's motion for an injunction and denied a doctor's subsequent motion to intervene. The facility and the doctor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital argued that the facility was a &quot;health care facility&quot; under Alaska Stat. &sect; 18.07.111(8) and therefore required to obtain a certificate of need to operate. The commissioner decided that the facility was not a health care facility, citing Alaska Admin. Code tit. 7, &sect; 07.012, because the facility was not registered as an independent diagnostic testing facility under Medicare. The trial court held that this regulation was void to the extent it negated the legislature's intent to include the facility within the definition of health care facility. The court held that the doctor's motion to intervene in the suit, six weeks after the injunction was granted, was untimely under Alaska R. Civ. P. 24 because he was aware of the suit from the beginning and was able to protect his rights. The court held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 18.07.111 did not treat similarly situated entities differently; it did not distinguish between radiologists and other specialists. However, that there was a question of fact as to whether the facility was exempt from &sect; 18.07.031's requirements because it was a private physician's office. Remand was required for consideration of this question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the doctor's motion to intervene but vacated the injunction and remanded the case for a factual determination of whether the facility was a private physician's office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sued appellee city in the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, First Judicial District, Juneau.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city taxed the sale of services; it assessed the sales tax against the taxpayers' business for the sale of two guided bear hunts. The taxpayers protested. The taxpayers challenged the validity of the city's sales tax ordinance in imposing a sales tax on services rendered at least partly outside the city or in interstate commerce. The taxpayers argued that the superior court erred by dismissing the action as moot. The city forgave any sales tax liability of the taxpayers and their guide business for hunts conducted through September 2004, no live dispute remained about whether the ordinance applied to the sales of those two hunts. The supreme court was unwilling to say that the superior court erred in declining to reach the merits of the taxpayers' contention. Further, a conclusion was not compelled that the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine applied. Finally, there was no abuse of discretion either in awarding attorney's fees of $500 or in awarding that amount without first asking the taxpayers to submit evidence of the fees they actually incurred during the administrative appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing the superior court appeal as moot and awarding the taxpayers attorney's fees of $ 500 was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

After leaving the courtroom, petitioner deposited a check that the victim had written him three years earlier. The district court found that this action violated a condition of petitioner's release by indirectly contacting the victim. On appeal, the court held that petitioner did not &quot;contact&quot; the victim by negotiating the check because while the bank's processing of the check had an effect on the victim, petitioner's act, occurring via a standardized and impersonal banking transaction, carried little communicative value. The only information conveyed was from a one-time withdrawal from the victim's account, and the negotiated check merely came into the victim's view. While the victim mentioned the check during her victim impact statement, her awareness of the check's existence did not transform petitioner's act into communication directed at her.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State employees who took early retirement and then became reemployed by the state were entitled to pension benefits for both periods of employment under Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.35.150. Employees were entitled to apply the version of &sect; 39.35.150 that was most beneficial to them. The state recalculated second retirement benefits under former section.150 for any member who had been in who had been in the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) before July 1, 1977, by which the retirees in this case received an increased benefit for their second round of employment. However, benefits from their first employment were decreased based on a recapture provision in former subsection.150(b). The court held that use of the recapture provision did not unconstitutionally diminish the retirees' benefits. PERS members could not mix and match parts a statutory provision from one era with those of another. Even with the recapture, the retirees enjoyed a net increase over what they would have received under the new version of &sect; 39.35.150. The recapture was not an &quot;adjustment&quot; prohibited by former Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.35.520(b) (1984) because it was merely the result of application of the old law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father claimed that the State had denied him due process of law in its enforcement of child support against him. In a previous action brought by the father, which also alleged a due process claim arising from alleged improprieties in child support collection efforts against him, the State was dismissed in a final judgment on the merits and no appeal was taken. The court concluded that each element of the test governing application of res judicata had been met. The due process arguments raised in the two cases were identical; and although the father advanced a new negligence claim, that claim also was precluded because it arose out of the same transaction and could have been asserted in the previous case. The rule against claim splitting provided that all claims arising out of a single transaction had to be brought in a single suit, and those that were not became extinguished by the judgment in the suit in which some of the claims were brought. All of the father's claims were based on the same child support enforcement efforts and were therefore precluded by the prior final judgment on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action, plaintiffs, commercial salmon fishers, sought a declaratory judgment that regulations promulgated by defendant, the Alaska Board of Fisheries, caused a taking or damaging of their property interests without just compensation. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, granted the state's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The fishers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board adopted various regulations from 1996 to 2002 that had the cumulative impact of reducing the amount of fish that the fishers were able to catch and thus reducing the value of their entry permits and shore fishery leases. As an initial matter, the court found that the request for a declaratory judgment was moot, given that the challenged regulations had been amended, but that the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine applied. On the merits, the court held that the regulations did not effect a taking of entry permits requiring just compensation. Under the plain language of Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.43.150(e), an entry permit was not compensable property for purposes of the takings clauses of the Fifth Amendment, Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 18, and Alaska Const. art. VIII, &sect; 16. The court also reasoned that a contrary conclusion would have violated Alaska Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 3, 15. The regulations also did not result in a compensable taking of the leases because the leases contained language permitting the regulations at issue. Even if the permits or leases were property, the property interests were not taken or damaged through the regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter first challenged the constitutionality of the Borough's 2002 reapportionment plan because it had a variance over the 10 percent prima facie constitutional limit. The Borough withdrew the 2002 plan and developed the 2004 plan that was prima facie constitutional with a sub-10 percent variance plan. The voter sought attorney's fees as the prevailing party. The court held that the voter was entitled to appropriate attorney's fees and costs under the catalyst theory pursuant to Alaska R. Civ. Proc. 82(b)(2). The voter next contended that the 2004 reapportionment plan violated equal protection, under Alaska Const. art. VI, &sect; 6, by drawing improper district lines to dilute the majority vote. On a deferential review, the court held that the superior court did not err in deciding that the 2004 plan was constitutional because it was reasonable and not arbitrary. The 2004 plan was adopted over a majority vote, and there was nothing in the record proving the Borough's intent to disenfranchise voters. The court also held that the summary judgment was proper because the voter's election challenge did not adhere to the grounds outlined in Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.20.540.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

While the owner was working at her desk, a coworker approached the owner's office and reached down to open the child's gate. The dog bit the coworker on the hand. The instant court concluded that the city's dog bite ordinance did not violate the owner's due process rights. The owner received notice and an opportunity to be heard, and she received a de novo trial in the superior court. The city's dog bite ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. Although the owner argued that the term &quot;provocation,&quot; which was not defined in the ordinance, was so vague as to not give adequate notice of what conduct was prohibited, the owner's arguments were unpersuasive. Whatever the outside bounds of &quot;without provocation&quot; might be, this case fell squarely within the phrase's plain meaning. No reasonable person would conclude that the coworker provoked the dog merely by walking to the owner's office door and putting her hand on the child's gate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alaska statute known as the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act (ASORA) required persons convicted of sex offenses to register and periodically re-register with the Alaska Department of Corrections, the Alaska State Troopers, or local police, and disclose detailed personal information, some of which is not otherwise public. Most of the disclosed information was publicly disseminated and was published by the State on the internet. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the statute under the ex post facto clause of the Alaska Constitution. He committed his crime, was convicted, and sentenced before ASORA was enacted. The Supreme Court of Alaska held that ASORA imposed burdens that had the effect of adding punishment beyond what could be imposed when the crime was committed in violation of Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 15. Therefore, ASORA's registration requirement did not apply to persons who committed their crimes before ASORA became effective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee medical center applied to the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) for a certificate of need (CON) to build an open-bore MRI facility. Appellant opponent filed an accusation requesting a hearing. When the request was denied, the opponent filed two superior court proceedings. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, consolidated the cases and dismissed them. The opponent appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DHSS commissioner denied the opponent's request for a hearing because he concluded that the opponent lacked standing. The superior court also concluded that the opponent lacked standing. On appeal, the issues were whether the opponent had standing, and whether attorney fees were awardable. Caselaw did not support a reading of Alaska Stat. &sect; 18.07.091(a) that would confer standing on the opponent. The supreme court concluded that because the opponent was not substantially affected by the CON, the opponent did not have standing to challenge the issuance of the CON under Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 18.07.081(a) or.091(a). Nevertheless, &sect;&sect; 18.07.081(a) and.091(a) were permissive statutes that expressly granted standing and only impliedly denied it; however, the opponent failed to even meet the more general standing requirements. The opponent was not a competitor of the facility. The supreme court noted that the opponent did not allege that he planned to get an MRI scan. At most, there was an indirect connection between health care costs and the issuance of CONs. Also, the opponent waived his argument that he should be shielded from attorney's fees awards under Alaska R. Civ. P. 82(b)(3)(I).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of both cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant arrestee filed a civil action against appellees, the State, a municipality, officers, and others, claiming that the officers used excessive force in arresting him. The arrestee sought compensatory damages. In addition, he requested punitive damages and injunctive relief. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, dismissed the injunctive relief and excessive force claims. The arrestee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee argued that the dismissal of his excessive force claim based on findings made by a federal district court at his sentencing for illegal possession of a firearm was improper. The arrestee was not afforded the opportunity at sentencing to fully litigate his claim that the officers used excessive force in apprehending him. The court found that it was unfair to preclude the arrestee from maintaining the civil suit on the basis of conclusions reached in a sentencing hearing where he was barred from presenting evidence that would have been important in the current case. The dismissal of the excessive force claim could not have been affirmed based on Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.81.370(a)(2) because there were unresolved factual questions. The dismissal could not have been affirmed based on Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.65.210(1) because the felony was the mere possession of a firearm, and the crime, standing alone, could not have been said to have substantially contributed to his injury. The issue of whether there should have been an injunction against the enforcement of a civil commitment order was moot. Finally, the question of the constitutionality of Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.30.700 was waived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the superior court was reversed with respect to the arrestee's claims based on excessive force. The matter was remanded for further proceedings. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several oil transporters, including plaintiff-appellant, challenged appellee-defendant city's ad valorem tax on large vessels engaged in interstate commerce. The Superior Court, Third Judicial District, Anchorage (Alaska), ruled that: (1) the tax as applied to the transporters violated the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, and (2) the tax did not violate the Tonnage Clause. The city appealed the first ruling; the transporter appealed the second.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ample evidence supported the conclusion that there existed a substantial nexus between the city and the transporter's vessels, and the city became a tax situs for the transporter. An apportionment formula was fair that apportioned the full value of a ship between the taxing jurisdictions in which it was regularly present in proportion to the number of days during the tax year that the ship was present in each jurisdiction. The city's measure assessed the extent of activity in the taxing jurisdiction relative to the activity in all taxing jurisdictions which satisfied the goal of apportionment. Because the formula was fair, and the permissible tax necessarily limited the taxing authority of the transporter's domicile, there was no risk of duplicative taxation. The tax was also externally consistent. Neither the tax nor the apportionment formula violated the Due Process Clause or the Commerce Clause. Likewise, because the tax was a fairly apportioned ad valorem tax on personal property, there was no Tonnage Clause violation. The city taxed the vessels' value using the mill rate for all other property; it thus taxed the vessels like other property because the tax was value based.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the superior court and remanded for entry of judgment for the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant shareholders sued appellee Alaska native corporation, challenging the legality of its payments to original shareholders over the age of 65 under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), 43 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1601 et seq., and Alaska state law, as well as the constitutionality of ANCSA.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court did not abuse its discretion in declining to consider additional evidence presented by the shareholders prior to granting the Alaska R.

The rejection of other materials was also affirmed as the so-called factual disputes were neither factual nor disputed. The superior court correctly held that the ANCSA expressly authorized the native corporation's elders' benefit program and the elders' settlement benefit trust, thereby preempting Alaska law, as the legislative history of 43 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1606(r) did not support the argument that &quot;benefits&quot; did not extend to cash contributions paid to the program and trust. Moreover, the shareholders failed to distinguish case law holding that native corporations had broad discretion to fashion elder benefit programs. Finally, the Fifth Amendment did not provide any relief as the takings claim was premature until the shareholders presented a claim for compensation pursuant to the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1491.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA) determined that the shipping rates charged by appellant pipeline owners were unjust and unreasonable from 1997 through 2000 and ordered refunds for that period.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the trial court correctly resolved the pipeline owners' arguments and adopted its opinion. The trial court held that the RCA's refusal to recuse a staff economist did not deny the pipeline owners a fair and impartial hearing in violation of the due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV and Alaska Const. art. 1, &sect; 7, based on the economist's prejudgment of the issues in a master's thesis, because there was no evidence suggesting that the commissioners were in any way dominated by the economist's opinions or that any commissioner prejudged any aspect of the case. The pipeline owners failed to show that the RCA acted unreasonably or arbitrarily in finding that the settlement methodology rates for all years prior to 1997 were based on accelerated, rather than straight-line, depreciation and fashioning an improved procedure for midstream rate-base determinations to avoid double recovery by the pipeline owners. The court rejected the contention that the RCA's conclusion that accelerated settlement methodology depreciation rather than straight-line depreciation was actually collected in the pre-1997 rates had no reasonable basis in the record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state-employed seaman, who was injured on the job, sued defendant State of Alaska, challenging the validity of Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.50.250(5), which, as amended, rescinded Alaska's waiver of sovereign immunity from suits under the federal Jones Act and referred state employees exclusively to the state workers' compensation system.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seaman argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.50.250(5) violated the Alaska Constitution's waiver of sovereign immunity set forth in Alaska Const. art. II, &sect; 21, was preempted by federal law, and violated his due process and equal protection rights. The instant court concluded that the statute did not violate Alaska Const. art. II, &sect; 21. The State's waiver of sovereign immunity was not absolute. The statute established procedures for suits against the State within the meaning of Alaska Const. art. II, &sect; 21. Rather than simply asserting sovereign immunity from suits by state-employed seamen, the statute provided that seamen could bring claims within the workers' compensation system. The statute was not superseded by the Jones Act. The State's sovereign immunity barred suits against it under the Jones Act. The Jones Act did not preempt or prohibit the State's attempt to modify remedies available to state-employed seamen, nor did it give state-employed seamen the right to sue the State without its explicit consent. The statute did not violate the seaman's rights to due process, trial by jury, or equal protection. The trial court did not err in reducing the State's attorney fee award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, First Judicial District, Juneau, concluded that tribal adoptions granted in favor of appellant paternal grandparents were not subject to full faith and credit or comity and denied appellants' motion to dismiss appellee maternal grandparents' child custody proceeding. Appellants filed an appeal. Appellee mother joined her parents arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were the paternal grandparents of two young tribal children. They filed a superior court custody petition and served appellees, the maternal grandparents. Appellees had previously been granted visitation with the children in state court guardianship proceedings after the children's mother killed their father. While the superior court custody dispute was pending, appellants obtained tribal council resolutions approving their adoption of the children. Appellants then moved to dismiss appellees' state court custody action based on their adoption of the children. Because appellees did not have prior notice of the tribal council adoption proceedings, the tribal adoption proceedings did not meet the requirements of Fourteenth Amendment due process. Therefore, the tribal council resolutions were not entitled to full faith and credit in Alaska state courts. The divorce exception to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1901 et seq., did not extend to custody disputes between grandparents. It was error for the superior court to create such an exception here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an unsuccessful civil rights action, the inmate was ordered to pay attorney's fees and interest. The State obtained a writ of execution for the inmate's prisoner trust account. The inmate argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.38.030 did not apply to him. The superior court denied the claim, and the inmate sought review. In affirming, the supreme court determined that, because the inmate fell under &sect; 09.38.030(f), he was excepted from &sect; 09.38.030(a), (b). Next, the supreme court did not have to decide whether former Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 33.32.050, 33.32.060 (repealed 2005) conflicted with Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.38.030(f). Alaska Stat. &sect; 33.30.201 was identical to the repealed statutes; therefore, the inmate's rights were the same under either the repealed or current statutes. However, even if the repealed statutes did apply, there was no conflict. Next, Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.38.030(f) did not violate the First Amendment, and it did not violate equal protection. The filing of the appeal from the State's first writ did not divest the superior court of jurisdiction to issue a second writ of execution, and there was no misconduct by the State's attorney in executing on the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the First Judicial District, Anchorage, Alaska, upheld appellee State's suspension of appellant business owner's authority to sell tobacco for sixty-five days and imposed civil fines because two of his employees had been convicted under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.76.100(a)(1) of negligently selling cigarettes to minors. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner argued that his due process rights were violated because Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.70.075(m) required suspension of his tobacco endorsement upon his employees' convictions of negligently selling cigarettes to minors, and gave the owner no opportunity to be heard on his contention that the convictions were not factually or legally supportable. The supreme court found that Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.70.075(d) and (m) erased any doubt as to the legislature's intent to hold licensees civilly liable for selling tobacco products to minors upon proof of their employees' convictions, without making their liability depend on proof of their employees' negligence. The State had a substantial interest in protecting the health of its citizens, especially minors, through the regulation of tobacco. The sale of tobacco was a heavily regulated activity, and the statute was designed to protect the health of minors by ensuring they did not have access to tobacco. The State's interest and the low risk of erroneous deprivation outweighed his economic interest in an unsuspended tobacco endorsement. There was no indication the owner's right to due process was violated by the way the hearings were conducted.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the retaliatory tax applied to the insurer and that the Division of Insurance reasonably implemented the statute. The insurer argued that the retaliatory tax violated Alaska's equal protection clause, Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1, but the court held that: (1) applying the tax to the insurer was fully consonant with the constitutionally permissible purpose of retaliatory tax statutes, which was to promote the interstate business of domestic insurers by deterring other states from enacting discriminatory or excessive taxes; and (2) since the retaliatory tax was applied to the insurer only because the insurer's state would have applied more onerous taxes on a hypothetical Alaskan nonprofit health care services corporation operating in that state, the purpose of Alaska Stat. &sect; 21.09.270 of equalizing and lowering taxes across states was fairly and substantially furthered.</SPAN></P>

The complaint alleged that the PCA violated state constitutional rights to privacy under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The trial court held that the PCA was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court concluded that the PCA did not strike the proper constitutional balance between the State's compelling interests and a minor's fundamental right to privacy. By prohibiting minors from terminating a pregnancy without the consent of their parents, the PCA bestowed upon parents a &quot;veto power&quot; over their minor children's abortion decisions. Under the PCA, it was no longer a pregnant minor who ultimately chose to exercise her right to terminate her pregnancy, but that minor's parents. The inclusion of a judicial bypass procedure did not reduce the restrictiveness of the PCA relative to a parental notification statute. Because the State failed to establish that the greater intrusiveness of a statutory scheme that required parental consent, rather than parental notification, was necessary to achieve its compelling interests, the PCA did not represent the least restrictive means of achieving the State's interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, criminal defense attorneys and an investigator, challenged provisions of the Alaska Victims' Rights Act of 1991, Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 12.61.100-.150, as unconstitutional. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, found that Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect;&nbsp;12.61.120(d) and .125(a)(2)(A), (B) violated the equal protection or due process clauses under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 7. Both appellees and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The advice and written consent provisions under Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 12.61.120(c)(2), (3), and .125(a)(2)(B) interfered with the investigations of a criminal defendant because adhering to them necessarily carried a message that it was undesirable to cooperate with defense representatives. Further, the written consent requirement imposed needless practical obstacles and was overbroad. The neutral objective of informing victims and witnesses of their rights and achieving the benefits that flowed from that information could be realized without those impediments. Thus, they were inconsistent with the due process rights of those accused of crime. Also, the impediment to defense investigations posed by the no-contact provision in Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.61.125(a)(1) was not justified because, if allowed to stand, the provision, especially as implemented, would cordon off many witnesses from defense interviews, threatening critical fair trial rights. Finally, Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 12.61.120(d) and .125(a)(2)(A), precluding defense representatives from undisclosed electronic recording, unduly interfered with a defendant's right to prepare and present a defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant listener filed suit in the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, First Judicial District, Juneau against appellees, a radio personality and his producer for, inter alia, defamation and spoliation of evidence. The court granted summary judgment against the listener on three claims. The jury found for defendants on two claims and found for the listener on the spoliation claim and awarded damages. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The listener argued, inter alia, that the superior court erred by granting summary judgment to the personality on her defamation claim. Many of the personality's remarks about the listener were pure insults that were not factually verifiable. Even those statements that could have constituted implied factual assertions, such as those about the listener's sexual habits, were not &quot;factual&quot; under the circumstances. No listener would have understood the personality's remarks about the listener's sexual habits to imply actual facts about her. Sex-related jokes were a common feature of the show. Even if the personality's remarks implied that the listener was in fact sexually frustrated and deprived, no reasonable listener would have believed that the personality was purporting to reveal actual, known facts about the listener. While the statements were offensive to any rational person, they were not defamatory. Additionally, the statements, uttered over the radio, were unlikely to achieve &quot;an immediate breach of the peace.&quot; Therefore, the superior court properly granted the personality's motion for summary judgment on the defamation claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was remanded for a new trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, First Judicial District, Ketchikan (Alaska) entered a judgment (1) affirming the denial by appellee Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission (CFEC) of appellate fisherman's application for a permit to fish in a geographically-defined fishery in which the fisherman failed to demonstrate the past participation required by Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.43.260(a); and (2) awarding attorney's fees to CFEC. The fisherman appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fisherman's application had been pending since 1977. He received notice in 1977 that his fishing in the waters of Annette Island Reserve (AIR) did not qualify him for the fishery because AIR waters were not part of the defined limited fishery. The fisherman argued that CFEC should grant him a permit to fish in the fishery because CFEC erroneously gave a permit to fish in the fishery to another individual who did not participate in the past. The appellate court concluded that the doctrines that the fisherman relied upon, including collateral estoppel, stare decisis, and due process, did not require that the appellate court perpetuate an erroneous decision in clear contravention of the applicable statutes and regulations. As to the superior court's awarding CFEC 20 percent of the attorney's fees necessarily incurred in the case pursuant to Alaska R. Civ. P. 82, the appellate court stated that (1) nothing in the fisherman's argument showed that the award was manifestly unreasonable as it would have to have been to be reversed, and (2) the fisherman's argument that he had litigated in good faith was immaterial because the 20 percent award did not rely on a lack of good faith.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks, granted the State and troopers summary judgment. The arrestee appealed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court applied the proper standard in ruling on defendants' summary judgment motion as it had no duty to fully explain its decision nor had it failed to fulfill its duty to consider the entire case setting. The arresting troopers were entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest and trespass to chattel claims as making arrests and seizing property interests fell within their usual authority, those acts were discretionary, and the arrestee's conclusory statements that the troopers enjoyed arresting him were insufficient to raise an issue of fact as to whether their conduct was malicious. The arresting troopers were entitled to qualified immunity on the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims as a violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.25.030 did not establish a per se violation of the Fourth Amendment. Moreover, the troopers had probable cause for the arrest as Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.30.020(e) strongly suggested that all violations of pretrial release conditions justified an arrest. Summary judgment was properly granted on the remaining claims against the supervising troopers and the State. The Alaska R. Civ. P. 82 attorney fee award was in error, but the fees were otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney fee award was vacated to the extent it awarded fees under Alaska R. Civ. P. 82. The order was otherwise affirmed. The case was remanded for entry of a consistent attorney's fee award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife argued that under Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.130, the statute of limitations should have been extended for the period of time that the driver was absent from the state for health and surgery reasons. Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.05.015, by authorizing service according to the Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure, authorized service on absent defendants. It applied to this case because Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.05.015(a)(3) provided for jurisdiction in an action claiming injury to person and property in the state arising out of an act or omission in the state by a defendant. Based on the long-arm statute and the means of service available under Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure, it was evident that the driver was at all times amenable to service of process.

Two interrelated issues were presented: (1) whether the Appeals Commission was a properly created quasi-judicial agency; and (2) whether the Appeals Commission represented executive branch encroachment on the power of the judiciary, in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. The State countered that the Appeals Commission was simply another quasi-judicial agency, creation of which was within the constitutional power of the legislature. The supreme court agreed that the agency was quasi-judicial, and it was properly established. The supreme court concluded that the legislature acted within its constitutional authority in creating the Appeals Commission and that, with limiting construction of Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.007, the authority of the Appeals Commission did not encroach on the judicial branch.

The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, ultimately relegated the churches to amicus curiae status after two lawsuits were consolidated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court did not question the State's ability to fairly and vigorously represent its citizens and the associations to which they belonged, including religious associations such as the churches. However, the churches had significant financial and potentially unrepresented constitutional interests in the litigation given their allegations that the pre-amendment practice of granting tax exemptions for teacher residences owned by nonreligious private schools violated equal protection. There may have been actual adversity as to the equal protection argument because it was unlikely that the State would have raised the issue. Although the State was not violating the Establishment Clause in trying to uphold a duly enacted statute, there was an appearance of adversity where the State asserted that the Establishment Clause impaired its ability to adequately represent the churches' interests. The churches wee therefore entitled under Alaska R. Civ. P. 24(a) to intervene as of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders denying the churches' motions to intervene as of right were reversed. The case was remanded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hunter brought suit, contending that certain aspects of the regulation governing the Tier II subsistence hunting permit point system discriminated against urban hunters in violation of state constitutional provisions requiring equal access to natural resources. The hunter challenged three criteria in the regulation used to identify subsistence hunters eligible for the caribou hunt: (1) access to alternative sources of game; (2) the cost of groceries; and (3) the cost of gasoline. The supreme court was first required to determine whether the challenged criteria was per se impermissible because they violated the rule against residency-based criteria in Part A of McDowell. The game ratio in Alaska Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 92.070(b)(1) sought to measure the relative availability of alternative sources of game. Access to other game was clearly a reasonable criterion to determine an applicant's dependence on subsistence hunting. The supreme court agreed, however, that the regulation's game ratio scoring system was not an accurate method of measuring access to other game. The current game ratio regulation was so faulty as to not satisfy the requirements of the Alaska Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business owner objected to the nonprofit organization's free bicycle loan program. The free program was funded from gaming profits. The business owner appealed the superior court's ruling as to the alleged violation of gaming statutes and public policy, bad faith and breach of fiduciary and statutory duty, and violations of substantive due process and privileges and immunities. The first case was dismissed because the business owner's corporation was not represented by an attorney as required by Alaska Stat. &sect; 22.20.040(a)(2). The corporation then assigned its claims to the business owner. The superior court had determined that several counts of the complaint were inappropriate assignments. The supreme court agreed that the assignment of claims was an invalid attempt to circumvent statutory requirements. Further, Alaska Stat. &sect; 05.15.100(a) provided that the department could issue a permit to a municipality or qualified organization. Also, Alaska Stat. &sect; 05.15.130 allowed for supplementing definitions of organizations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents alleged that their son was attacked and injured by the owners' dog one month before the son's eighth birthday on July 24, 1998. The parents sued the dog owners on May 29, 2003, almost five years after the alleged incident and a few months before their son's 13th birthday. On appeal of the trial court's order dismissing the action, the court reversed. The court held that because &sect; 09.10.140(c) foreclosed the son's personal injury action due to the fact that his parents failed to timely file suit, it violated his procedural due process right of access to the courts. Given the important interest involved, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the right was high, and the State's interests in encouraging self-reliance and independence of minors, preventing the litigation of stale claims, and reducing the costs of malpractice insurance for professionals were not sufficient to warrant the deprivation of the minors' rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being questioned by a detective about allegations that he had sexually abused his girlfriend's 10-year-old daughter, defendant fled the state.

The trial court dismissed the charges on the ground that the pre-indictment delay was unreasonable and had prejudiced defendant, and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court disagreed and reversed. The court held that defendant's flight in combination with the child's mental health needs justified the pre-indictment delay. Law enforcement officers were unable to locate defendant until he returned to the state in 2002, and the child was institutionalized for a significant period of time after the alleged abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated action, appellant state sought review of a declaratory judgment entered in favor of appellees, a village and others, by the First Judicial District (Alaska) in which the court declared H.B. 145, 2003 Leg. (Alaska 2003) invalid and sought review of a second action in which an award of attorney fees in favor of appellee union was entered by the First Judicial District (Alaska) against the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village asserted that H.B. 145 was invalid because it changed a rule of practice and procedure without having been passed by a two-thirds vote of the legislature as required by Alaska Const. art. IV, &sect; 15 and contravened the right of access to the courts in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Alaska Constitution. The union claimed that it was entitled to an award of attorney fees under the public interest litigant exception. The reviewing court found that Rule 82 was a rule of practice and procedure authorized under Alaska Const. art. IV, &sect; 15, but the public interest litigant exception to Rule 82 was a rule of substantive law that could be changed by the legislature without a two-thirds vote. Courts when considering the &quot;other equitable factors&quot; ground for varying awards should be cognizant of the need to avoid using the public interest litigant ground as a means to encourage public interest litigation in violation of the policy underlying HB 145. A declaratory judgment striking down HB 145 on the ground that it necessarily impeded access to the courts was inappropriate, and any such determination had to be made on a case-by-case basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The declaratory judgment was reversed and the award of attorney fees was vacated. Both actions were remanded to their respective superior courts for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

The individual's procedural due process challenges lacked merit as there was no prejudice from the failure to list witnesses and the petition and notice of hearing informed her of the nature and purpose of the hearing. The failure to provide a visitor's report during the hearing on the petition for the administration of a psychotropic medication as required by Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.30.839(d) was plain error as this was a non-emergency situation and the report was an essential component of the statutory scheme.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the State and two retirement systems, challenged a decision from the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which granted appellee retirees' motion for summary judgment in an equal protection challenge to cost-of-living allowances (COLA). The retirees filed an appeal from the summary judgment granted against them on the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retirees challenged a COLA given in two retirement systems under Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.35.480(a) and Alaska Stat. &sect; 14.25.142. They contended that the COLA residency requirements were violative of the right to travel and the right to equal protection under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;1. The superior court determined that the COLA was unconstitutional on equal protection grounds, but granted the State's motion for summary judgment on damages. This appeal followed. The supreme court determined that the right to travel was a right protected by the equal protection clause of the Alaska Constitution. The supreme court used a three factor test to determine the level of scrutiny required and whether equal protection had been violated. The legitimate purpose of the small COLA payments was to encourage the retirees to remain in Alaska by partially offsetting Alaska's higher cost of living. The payments were fairly and substantially related to that purpose, and they did not substantially infringe on the right of retirees to live elsewhere.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nonprofit organization and individual sued defendant State and Lieutenant Governor, challenging the decision to reject a petition proposing a ballot initiative designed to curb new taxes. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage granted summary judgment to defendants on the ground that Alaska Const. art. II, &sect; 14 could only be changed by constitutional amendment. Plaintiffs challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed initiative would have required, inter alia, a super-majority vote by the legislature to enact or increase taxes. Plaintiffs argued that Alaska Const. art. II, &sect; 14 simply established the minimum baseline for enacting a law. Plaintiffs' interpretation was unpersuasive where the clear consensus in other states was that super-majority voting requirements implicated a basic subject matter usually addressed by constitutional provision. Moreover, &sect; 14 unmistakably signaled that Alaska's constitutional framers intended the majority-provision to be a substantive requirement instead of a mere procedural rule. In addition, the negative phrasing in &sect; 14 did not have any automatic significance. Most importantly, the examples of more stringent voting requirements in other sections of the Alaska Constitution was convincing evidence of the framers' intent that &sect; 14 was not a minimal standard. Thus, &sect; 14 prevented an initiative from addressing the subject of the number of votes needed to enact a bill into law. The Lieutenant Governor, therefore, properly rejected the proposed initiative at the review stage for failing to comply with constitutional provisions regulating initiatives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper arrested the driver for DUI after he failed three roadside sobriety tests. The trooper believed that the driver had previously been driving his father's vehicle, which he and his friends left in a ditch. The driver was a passenger in another vehicle at the time he was stopped and arrested. On appeal of the revocation of the driver's license, the court held that the hearing officer erred by failing to inform the driver, who was proceeding pro se, of the correct procedures for obtaining the central piece of evidence in the case, a tape recording of the stop and arrest. The driver had requested a continuance on the ground that he had been unable to gather all of the evidence he needed and the superior court heard testimony that he had previously, but unsuccessfully, attempted to obtain a copy of the recording. The driver was obviously attempting to obtain potentially exculpatory evidence, and his failure to request a copy of the recording appeared to have been the product of his belief that the tape did not exist.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the failure to list witnesses in the case as required by Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.30.730(a)(6) was not plain error because the petition for the 30-day commitment was signed by two API physicians and the only witness testifying before the hearing was another API physician. The requirements of Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.30.730(a)(7) were fulfilled because the commitment petition stated that the patient was in a manic state, was homeless, and had not been compliant with her medication for three months. However, the court vacated the order approving the non-consensual administration of psychotropic medication because no vistor's report was prepared or presented before the hearing as required by Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.30.839(d).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, retired state employees, sued defendants, administrators of two public employee retirement systems and the state, alleging that a residency requirement violated their federal and state constitutional rights. The Superior Court Third Judicial District (Alaska) held that the residency requirement was invalid on state equal protection grounds but the employees were entitled to prospective relief only. Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were a retired correctional officer who now resided in Hawaii and a retired teacher who wished to relocate out of Alaska. The employees claimed that the cost-of- living allowance (COLA) residency requirement was an unconstitutional restriction on the right to travel and a violation of equal protection of the law under the provisions of the federal and state constitutions. The supreme court found that the main purpose of the COLA was to encourage retired public employees to continue to live in the state by helping to defray the higher cost of living. The COLA had a fair and substantial relationship to its purpose. The COLA was intended to influence retirees' decision-making as to where to live after retirement. This was acceptable because the COLA was reasonably related to the cost-of-living differential between Alaska and most other areas of the United States and because the COLA was a small part of retirees' retirement income. The COLA payments to resident retirees did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Alaska Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipality claimed, and the citizens did not contest, that since 1994, the municipality had issued four non-transferable permits and no limited permits. The municipality argued that taxicab permits were municipally controlled resources and thus public assets. The citizens submitted to the municipality a petition for an initiative requiring the city to issue a taxi permit to any qualified person paying an administrative fee. The municipal clerk rejected the petition, reasoning that the initiative would make an appropriation, in violation of Alaska Const. art. XI, &sect; 7. On appeal, the main question was whether the initiative proposal would make an appropriation, a question that turned on whether the taxicab permits were public assets. The supreme court determined that the taxicab initiative did not violate the limitation contained within Alaska Const. art. XI, &sect; 7 on appropriation by initiative. The taxicab permits were not public assets, and the proposed initiative would not make an appropriation. Further, the initiative was not stale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner rape victim sued respondent State, alleging negligent parole supervision. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, denied the State's summary judgment motion and issued an order that the victim's injuries were to be treated as a single injury for purposes of Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.17.010 and that the noneconomic damages could not exceed $400,000. Both parties' petitions for review were granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State owed a duty to the victim to exercise due care in supervising parolees given prior precedent establishing that duty. On remand, the superior court was to determine whether each of the allegedly negligent decisions was a discretionary function based on the principles outlined in case law. Since the superior court's reexamination of whether the State was entitled to discretionary function immunity could affect the causation analysis, the court declined to decide whether the State was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on causation. The claim that the cap in Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.17.010 violated the victim's equal protection rights under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1 was subject to minimum scrutiny review as the restriction did not limit or block the victim's right to access the courts and noneconomic damages did not provide for basic needs. The cap did not violate the victim's equal protection rights as it satisfied the means-end fit requirement. However, the victim's damages were not limited to a single cap amount as she was entitled to recover the cap amount for each of the three types of sexual penetrations that formed the basis of the parolee's three convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order that the victim's potential noneconomic damages be capped at $400,000 was reversed. The order denying the State's summary judgment motion was vacated. The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the State and the Acting Director of the Division of Family and Youth Services, sought review of a judgment the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, refusing to dismiss, under Alaska R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), several of respondent Alaska Native Villages' claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 alleging ongoing systematic violations of the Adoption Assistance Act and the Indian Child Welfare Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that the villages could bring suit as parens patriae under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 to enforce rights that were created by the Adoption Assistance Act and the Indian Child Welfare Act. However, because the villages could not use &sect; 1983 to enforce rights they possessed as sovereigns, the villages' claims on their own behalf could not go forward. Although the villages could bring suit against the director in his official capacity, they could not sue the State directly under &sect; 1983. The court further held that the villages stated a claim under the Adoption Assistance Act because 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 675(1)(B). 675(5)(A), (C) created enforceable rights to a state plan that provided for the development of individual case plans and a case review system. The villages also stated a claim under the Indian Child Welfare Act, as 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1914 created a remedy that was unavailable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1914 did not limit 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and allowing a &sect; 1983 action was not incompatible with the Indian Child Welfare Act. The court held that it would be premature for it to evaluate the propriety of the remedy the villages had requested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that the villages were proper plaintiffs to bring parens patriae claims was affirmed. The judgment that the villages could bring claims on their own behalf was reversed, as was the judgment that the villages could bring claims against the State for violations of the Adoption Assistance Act. The judgment that the villages could bring claims against the director in his official capacity for violations of the Acts was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters alleged that former Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.60.101(21) infringed on their freedoms of speech and political association and their right to equal protection of the laws because it required a group to attain at least three percent of the votes polled in the last gubernatorial election or to register the equivalent number of voters. The trial court granted the Division summary judgment, holding that &sect; 15.60.101(21) was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 15.60.101(21) was constitutional because (1) the voters overstated the magnitude of their injury, as they were not totally deprived of the opportunity to place candidates on the ballot; (2) the state's interest in requiring a significant modicum of support was compelling because it helped avoid confusion, deception, and frustration of the democratic process at the general election; and (3) &sect; 15.60.101(21) was sufficiently narrowly tailored to the state's interests to justify burdening the voters' rights. Given the more reliably competitive nature of the governor's race, it was not unreasonable for the legislature to conclude that it offered a better gauge for popular support of a political party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In granting summary judgment to appellees, the superior court ruled that secession was illegal. On review, the court affirmed the judgment, finding that the LG correctly declined to certify the initiative and agreeing that secession was clearly unconstitutional. Although neither the Alaska Constitution nor the United States Constitution expressly prohibited secession, the initiative was clearly unconstitutional under U.S. Supreme Court decisions addressing secession, and the Supremacy Clause of U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, bound the states to those decisions. Neither U.S. Const. amend. IX nor X preserved the right to secede because a state could not reserve a power that it never possessed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After being convicted under Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.130 of the criminally negligent homicide of his father, appellant son attempted to obtain the benefits devised to him under his father's will. Pursuant to Alaska's &quot;slayer statute,&quot; Alaska Stat. &sect; 13.12.803, the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Second Judicial District, Nome, found that the son was not entitled to inherit under the will as a result of his conviction. The son appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court also found that no manifest injustice resulted from the forfeiture because the son retained sufficient income earning capacity and property holdings and he &quot;would not be beggared if he did not receive&quot; the funds. The son was convicted of criminally negligent homicide which established a felonious killing under the slayer statute. As a criminally negligent homicide was an unintentional homicide, under &sect; 13.12.803(k), the son was entitled to avoid the effects of the slayer statute if he proved that applying the statute to him would result in manifest injustice. The relevant comparison was between the son's conduct and that of a typical offender convicted of negligent homicide. The son was sentenced to three and one-half years in prison and that approached the presumptive term for second felony offenses, suggesting that the superior court did not believe the son's acts fell at the lowest level of culpability for a negligent homicide. The Supreme Court of Alaska held that the superior court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that manifest injustice would not result from application of the slayer statute, and the son's constitutional challenges were unavailing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After entering a plea of no contest, defendant was convicted of exploitation of a minor and possession of child pornography. Defendant was also convicted of first degree attempted misconduct involving a controlled substance. The Court of Appeals of the State of Alaska reversed the superior court's judgment that the &quot;least serious&quot; mitigating factor did not apply at sentencing. The State petitioned for hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was alleged to have made approximately 100 photographs and three videotapes of the child, who was 16 and 17 when the pictures and videos were made. At sentencing, defendant sought a &quot;least serious&quot; statutory mitigating factor, pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.155(d)(9) (former). The supreme court held that the superior court did not err in rejecting the &quot;least serious&quot; mitigating factor because the child was two years younger than the cutoff age for exploitation when many of the photos were taken. Further, the substantial number of pornographic photos and videos that defendant both produced and possessed sustained the rejection of a &quot;least serious mitigating factor.&quot; Moreover, the supreme court rejected defendant's argument that the mitigating factor should apply because he did not intend to distribute the materials; the intent to distribute was not an element of either the exploitation of a minor statute or the possession of child pornography statute. Although some of the acts were not the most serious, it did not follow that defendant's acts were &quot;among the least serious&quot; in the definitions of the exploitation and possession statutes as required by &sect; 12.55.155(d)(9).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the intermediate appellate court's decision holding that defendant's conduct was among the least serious conduct included in the definition of the offenses. The matter was remanded for reconsideration of defendant's claim that his composite sentence should be reduced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, awarded appellee mother sole legal and shared physical custody of the couple's daughter. Appellant father moved to modify the custody award, and he appealed after his motion was denied. The father then challenged the constitutionality of Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.20.090 and Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.24.150. The father's motion was denied, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court had previously rejected the father's constitutional arguments because the father had failed to raise them in the superior court, and he had asserted them for the first time on appeal. On appeal, the father argued the superior court erred in failing to make specific findings in support of its ruling, and the trial court erred in declining to declare that Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.24.150 and Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.20.090 were unconstitutional. The father advanced that the trial court failed to make adequate findings or conclusions at law, but Alaska R. Civ. P. 52(a) was not applicable to this action. The father asserted that some statutory factors were vague, and that the best-interests factors were applied arbitrarily. The supreme court also noted that the arguments concerning the alleged unconstitutionality of the original custody ruling might be interpreted as asserting that the same error would likely recur in any new custody decision addressing changed circumstances. Nevertheless, the supreme court saw no sound basis in the law or the record to conclude that the best-interests factors, as applied in light of these changes, would produce an unconstitutional custody ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the superior court's order dismissing the motion for a declaratory judgment.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court affirmed however, stating that it agreed with both the neutral-principles approach adopted by the superior court and the result that it reached. The supreme court also affirmed the superior court's determination that the individuals were liable for trespass and conversion with respect to the property properly awarded to the AMC. The AMC had cross-appealed, seeking reversal of the determination that the church was entitled to the church's corporate entity and the name. Because the supreme court agreed with the superior court that the church was entitled to retain its independent corporate existence and name, it affirmed that determination as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants requested a declaratory judgment that appellees had not verified the signatures of an initiative imposing additional taxes on the cruise ship industry, in accord with statutes. The court affirmed, and held that although the division's method of auditing the signatures may have been somewhat imprecise in that a subscriber's voting registration status could only be verified as of the date the petitions were filed, the audit was nevertheless reasonable given that there was no statutory requirement that each signature be dated at the time of the audit. Because the failure to provide a place of execution was a technical deficiency, that did not impede the purpose of the certification requirement, the court concluded that the petition booklets should not be rejected on those grounds. The court also held that the division construed its own regulations in a manner that struck a careful balance between the people's right to enact legislation by initiative and the regulations requiring that potential petition subscribers be made aware that the circulators may have a motivation to induce them to sign the petition other than a personal belief in the value of the initiative.</SPAN></P>

Shortly after the company initiated its appeals of the permits, it received a Department invoice for $ 8,073 for &quot;permit administration fees.&quot; The invoice included charges for the time the Department spent preparing its defense against the company's appeals. The Department's deputy commissioner denied the company's fee appeal. The trial court upheld the decision of the deputy commissioner. On appeal, the court concluded that Alaska Stat. &sect; 46.14.240(c)(3) allowed the Department to recover the costs of administrative appeals through permit administration fees. Further, the Department's interpretation of &sect;&nbsp;46.14.240(c) did not violate the company's due process rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An arbitrator ruled that a terminated police officer had to be reinstated with back pay and benefits for the two-year period after his termination. The superior court judge concluded that the adverse employment action that triggered the increased actuarial liability was not directed at the System's pension plan. Also, he concluded that the liability risk was inherent to the System. In the second matter, however, another superior court judge concluded that requiring the System to absorb a grievance settlement's impact was unconstitutional pursuant to Alaska Const. art. XII, &sect; 7. The supreme court concluded that the police officer's retroactive compensation was calculated just as contemplated by the System's pension plan. Also, the fact that the Board was not a party to the police officer's grievance did not change the result. The grievance awards increased the System's costs and impacted the ability of members to receive surplus benefits; however, allowing the System to absorb losses from grievances did not change the basic operations of the System or unconstitutionally impair a vested right. The System provided for retroactive compensation due to grievance settlements.</SPAN></P>

The definition of business was incorporated into the definition of &quot;Off Premises Canvassing&quot; (OPC). It was OPC, and not business more broadly, that was regulated by the ordinance. The superior court's determination that the ordinance &quot;prohibited the sale of anything on public streets and sidewalks in the central business area of Skagway&quot; based on the definition of business, was not supported directly by the language of the ordinance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In ongoing litigation, following an earlier opinion requiring appellant railroad to obtain a conditional use permit, the railroad enacted emergency regulation. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, granted summary judgment to appellee native village. The railroad appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad wished to remove granite rock from the quarry on culturally significant land located in the village. The emergency regulation allowed the railroad to remove rock from the quarry without applying for a conditional use permit. The railroad also asked the legislature to clarify that the railroad was exempt from municipal zoning laws. The legislature created a task force to study the issue. The railroad argued on appeal that a reading of Alaska Stat. &sect; 42.40.390 allowing the railroad to promulgate rules that conflicted with local ordinances was not inconsistent with the supreme court's earlier opinion. Further, the railroad argued that the supreme court did not decide whether &sect; 42.40.390 was a choice of law provision because the railroad had not yet adopted a land use regulation.

Curda, Judge. Superior Court No. 4BE-03-177 CI.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six respondents alleged that they were subjected to childhood sexual abuse by a Catholic priest in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In 2003, they filed suit against, inter alia, petitioner bishop, the priest's former employer. The bishop filed a motion to dismiss based, inter alia, on the statute of limitations. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Bethel, held the motion in abeyance. The bishop petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bishop argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.065, which eliminated the statute of limitations for sexual abuse claims, was enacted after respondent's claims were already time-barred and asserted that the statute did not apply retroactively to revive claims which had lapsed before its enactment. The bishop argued that the external affidavits presented by respondents were not relevant to their statute of limitations argument. The bishop posited that since the statute of limitations issue involved pure questions of law which were not fact dependent it was amenable to immediate appellate review. The Supreme Court of Alaska granted the petition in order to clarify the law that applied to the instant case. The supreme court concluded that &sect; 09.10.065 did not revive civil claims that were time-barred before the effective date of the statute, which was October 1, 2001. Neither &sect; 09.10.065 nor any of its predecessor statutes revived time-barred claims. Had the legislature intended to revive time-barred civil claims, it would have explicitly stated so. That the legislature chose not to add such retroactive language, lead to the conclusion that &sect; 09.10.065 did not act retrospectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the superior court to hold the motion to dismiss in abeyance pending further discovery was affirmed. The case was returned to the superior court. Once sufficient discovery was conducted, the statute of limitations affirmative defense was to be resolved in advance of trial as a preliminary question of fact following an appropriate evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted of second-degree murder and was sentenced to serve 60 years in prison, with 15 years suspended.

The DOC denied her request. On appeal of the trial court's order, the court held that the DOC did not violate the prisoner's procedural due process rights by denying her request because she did not point to any plausible indications that she had a medical condition that, if confirmed by a physician, might entitle her to clemency. The prisoner did not describe to the DOC or to the trial court any specific medical problem that might qualify as an &quot;exception circumstance&quot; warranting clemency. She did not point to prison medical records, pre-incarceration medical records, or any opinion of prison medical staff, lay witnesses, or outside doctors suggesting that she had a specific medical condition potentially justifying clemency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee was arrested for disorderly conduct in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.61.110 after he got into a verbal dispute with the state trooper while in a court clerk's office. On appeal of the trial court's order granting the trooper summary judgment, the court held that the arrestee's version of events and the affidavit of his friend raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the facts and circumstances known to the trooper would support a reasonable belief that the arrestee's words were unreasonably loud or created a hazardous condition. The arrestee alleged that the trooper arrested him because the arrestee continued to speak after the trooper repeatedly warned him not to, and his friend stated in an affidavit that both the arrestee and the trooper spoke to each other at about the same level of voice volume, a very formal and normal tone of voice. He also stated that during the incident no one in the office asked anyone to lower their voices. The objective reasonableness of the trooper's decision to arrest the arrestee also presented a question of fact that required resolution by a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which denied class certification and dismissed appellant's action against numerous appellees, including the Alaska Public Defender Agency, hundreds of unnamed state employees, several attorneys, and others. Appellant's action challenged 1995 legislation amending Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.120(a) (1986) and sought injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1986, appellant was convicted of robbery in the first degree and criminal mischief. In 1994, before his probation for the 1986 conviction ended, he was convicted of another charge of criminal mischief. The trial court revoked his probation and imposed a new term of probation extending for a year longer than the previous term. Appellant sought post-conviction relief, claiming that a 1995 law changing the jurisdiction of the court of appeals effectively eliminated his right to appeal his sentence, a right upon which he had relied when entering a plea in 1986. The superior court denied relief, the court of appeals affirmed, and the court declined to review. He then filed his civil action and sought class certification. The court first affirmed the superior court's denial of certification because a pro se plaintiff could not properly represent a class. The court then noted that appellant's substantive claims were barred by res judicata. His arguments were all predicated on the claim that the 1995 changes in &sect; 12.55.120(a) prevented him from seeking review of the superior court's decision to add a year to his probation. That claim had been litigated at least once by the same parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff senior citizens challenged a veto of a longevity bonus, based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel. They also asserted a Contract Clause claim and legal entitlement under Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.45.010 et seq. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks, granted summary judgment to defendant State, defendant Governor, and defendant Commissioner on all claims. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor exercised his veto power to eliminate the appropriation for the longevity bonus, which had been created for senior citizens 65 years old or older. The veto was exercised despite a predecessor's letter and legislation phasing out the longevity bonus. The supreme court agreed with the summary judgment but disagreed with the superior court's analysis. The senior citizens, through uncontroverted evidence in the form of affidavits, established that the senior citizens changed their positions in reliance upon the longevity bonus; however, they failed to establish that a promise was made. Moreover, the longevity bonus program was not an open offer to contract; therefore, it did not implicate the Contract Clause. The senior citizens were also not entitled to the bonus under Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.45.010 et seq. because the payments for the bonus were made out of annual appropriations. By failing to provide for an annual appropriation, the legislature acted consistently with the statute. In its appeal, the State challenged the superior court's determination that the senior citizens were public interest litigants exempt from paying attorney's fees. Additional findings were needed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed superior court's grant of summary judgment to the State on the promissory estoppel, Contract Clause, and entitlement claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant defendant sued three attorneys at the Alaska Public Defender Agency (the public defenders), in the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, alleging that they violated his constitutional rights while representing him in a pending criminal matter. The trial court dismissed his complaint under Alaska R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">More than eight months before the scheduled start of his trial, defendant sued the public defenders. His amended complaint alleged that they interfered with his federal and state constitutional rights. It also alleged that they breached their statutory duties and caused him emotional and financial harm. Although the factual basis for the accusations was unclear from the complaint, defendant apparently believed that they failed to conduct diligent and timely discovery. The primary issue presented on appeal was whether defendant could bring a claim against the public defenders directly under the Alaska Constitution. Defendant sued more than eight months before his criminal trial was to begin. The trial and pre-trial criminal process provided ample alternative avenues for remedying any constitutional violations allegedly caused by his attorneys during discovery. Furthermore, if he was convicted, he would have the right to a direct appeal as well as an opportunity to seek post-conviction relief for ineffective assistance of counsel. A Bivens-type action was therefore unnecessary to protect his state constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Superior Court No. 3AN-99-3479 CI.  <BR>Allen v. Department of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Div., 15 P.3d 743, 2000 Alas. LEXIS 118 (Alaska, 2000)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, ruled, inter alia, that Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.27.194 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to appellant father's claim and that the division's 10 month delay in deciding the father's petition to modify his child support obligation had not violated his due process rights. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main issues were (1) whether the child support enforcement division erred in deciding the father's petition to modify his child support, (2) whether it violated his rights by reporting his delinquent arrears to credit-reporting bureaus, and (3) whether various delays violated his right to due process. The appellate court affirmed the division's decision on the petition for modification, holding that the division properly calculated and reported the father's delinquent arrears and, despite finding several instances of regrettable delay, that no violation of the father's right to due process occurred. The father asserted, inter alia, that his due process rights were violated by the division's 10 month delay in addressing his petition to reduce his child support. There was no question that the division's and the court system's handling of the case was far from exemplary and regrettably caused several appreciable delays. The appellate court nevertheless failed to see any circumstances that rose to the level of a due process violation. There was no indication that the father's ability to present evidence was significantly impaired by the division's or the court system's actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that the Board erred in terminating his benefits pursuant to the 75 percent rule because it was inconsistent with the statutes governing occupational disability benefits. He argued that under Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.35.680(26) an employee was eligible for occupational disability benefits if he could not perform his old job or a comparable position made available by a Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) employer but found a well-paying job outside the PERS system. The appellate court concluded that a person who was able to perform a comparable job outside the PERS system, but who was unable to perform a PERS job, was within the definition of occupational disability under &sect; 39.35.680(26). The 75 percent policy and the regulations codifying that policy were inconsistent with the definition of &quot;employer&quot; in the statute. The plain meaning of the statute defining occupational disability as an inability to perform the employee's usual duties or the duties of a comparable position that a PERS employer made available was clear. The Board's termination of the employee's benefits could not be affirmed because he failed to accept a job offer under Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.35.415.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that the evidence procured by the officers' warrantless entry and search of the home had to be excluded because the search violated fundamental rights under the Fourth Amendment and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 14 and 22. The State maintained that license revocation hearings were comparable to probation revocation proceedings, and therefore appellant was prevented from raising the exclusionary rule. The appellate court agreed, finding that in driver's license revocation cases, applying the exclusionary rule for search and seizure violations would not add significant deterrence because the police were already sufficiently deterred from such unlawful conduct by the applicability of the exclusionary rule to all criminal cases that may result from their investigations. The officer initiated a criminal investigation after seeing appellant flee from the scene on foot and after discovering the strong odor of alcohol in the vehicle. The search of the house was done pursuant to the criminal investigation. Defendants were not entitled to application of the exclusionary rule for violations of the Fourth Amendment or Alaska's search and seizure provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a civil liberties group and nine same-sex couples, sued defendants, the State and a municipality, alleging that employee benefits programs violated the Equal Protection Clause of Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1 because benefits were available for married couples but not for same-sex partners. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, granted summary judgment for defendants, and plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants provided benefits for married employees but not for domestic partners. The court found that those programs violated equal protection under the Alaska Constitution. Although the programs did not explicitly exclude same-sex couples, they were facially discriminatory because same-sex couples were barred from marriage in Alaska under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 25, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. Opposite-sex couples in domestic partnerships were not treated the same because marriage was available to them, while same-sex couples were absolutely precluded from becoming eligible for benefits. Applying minimum scrutiny under the sliding scale analysis for Alaska equal protection claims, the court found that defendants had legitimate governmental interests in cost control, administrative efficiency, and promotion of marriage but that the absolute denial of benefits to public employees with same-sex domestic partners was not substantially related to those interests. The court also determined that Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 25 did not preclude challenges by same-sex couples to government policies that discriminated between married and unmarried couples.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment in favor of defendants and invited supplemental briefing on the issue of remedy, with the case to be remanded after hearing on that issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the applicant reported to a meeting the morning after he claimed he was hired, he was told he was being &quot;let go&quot; due to his participation in previous litigation. The court held that even if an instruction's failure to list the element of consideration tainted the jury's finding that the employer hired the applicant, it would not have affected the jury's finding that the employer had offered the applicant a position. The employer could not rely on the applicant's lack of performance caused by the employer's own illegal conduct as a shield against liability. The court also concluded that there was an actionable public policy tort in Alaska for retaliation against witnesses in legal proceedings. The court could not conclude that a different result would have been likely had a complete mixed-motive instruction been given. However, no reasonable jury could find that the likely duration of employment would have exceeded three years, and the court vacated the jury's lost wages awards and remand for revision. Furthermore, Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.17.020(j) did not violate substantive due process, nor did it result in an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation failed to deliver engines the air service sought, and the corporation failed to return the air service's deposit. At issue on appeal was the individual's liability for the actions of the corporation, and the amount of damages that were awarded. The supreme court concluded that even if the air service were not entitled to summary judgment regarding individual's personal liability for the corporation, the individual had not contested that he would still be jointly liable in his individual capacity for both punitive and compensatory damages because of his misrepresentations. Consequently, a reversal would not have altered the individual's liability. As to the award of damages, the supreme court noted that the individual intentionally deceived the air service, and he continued to lie to the air service to conceal his fraud and to delay legal action. The individual's actions strongly resembled criminal actions. The punitive damages award was constitutionally sound given the reprehensibility of the individual's conduct, the necessity of a large penalty to alter the incentives of this type of fraud, and the potential penalties available under Alaska criminal and civil law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the State, charged respondents, three fishermen, with landing their catches without state permits. The fishermen argued that the State exceeded its authority when it required them to possess such permits. They also argued the State was preempted by federal law from requiring federal permit holders to obtain such State permits. The Alaska Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the charges. The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals concluded that the Alaska Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission (CFEC), was only authorized to issue interim-use permits to persons fishing in areas that were potentially subject to limited entry by the CFEC. Therefore, it held the CFEC had no authority to require fishers in federal waters to hold interim-use permits to land their catches in Alaska and concluded that Alaska Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect; 05.110(c) (2001), was an invalid regulation. The court of appeals also concluded that former Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.675 did not require fishers to have interim-use or entry permits, but instead directed fishers without same to obtain landing permits. However, the Alaska Supreme Court held the State did not exceed its authority when it required the fishers to possess interim-use permits. It additionally held that federal law did not preempt the State's permit requirements, and that the permit requirements did not violate the federal constitution. The supreme court looked, in part, to the Halibut Act, 16 U.S.C.S. 773, and the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C.S. 1801-1883, in its analysis, in concluding that the State regulation at issue was not preempted by federal law.</SPAN></P>

The political parties filed suit and the trial court granted summary judgment for the parties, holding that, by making it unlawful for them to present their candidates together on a combined ballot, the statutes unconstitutionally burdened their associational rights. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the statutes violated Alaska Const. art.

The court held that prohibiting combined ballots placed a heavy burden on the political parties' associational rights; that most of the State's interests were too abstract to support that burden; and the remainder of the State's interests were not closely related to the prohibition on combined ballots.</SPAN></P>

Defendants presented affidavits that they believed that plaintiff had failed to consult with city officials as required by law for the consolidation, at least as far as defendants understood the requirement, and thus defendants had reasonable grounds for believing that plaintiff was not complying. The court also held that the case presented neither a flagrant constitutional violation nor a situation where other remedies for any violation did not exist and affirmed the denial of plaintiff's implied constitutional tort cause of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter challenged the constitutionality of election procedures for voting on an initiative proposition. He obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) that allowed him to cast a vote on the proposition in the primary without affiliating with one of the six political parties offering ballots, but his main constitutional challenge was later mooted by legislation that revamped the procedure for primary elections. The superior court declined to award attorney's fees to the voter because it found that neither party had prevailed under the catalyst approach. The voter then sought review. In vacating the judgment, the court determined that it was not error for the superior court to reject the voter's fee request under the catalyst approach. The catalyst theory should not have been used to determine prevailing party status when a case was mooted by a legislative enactment absent the very clearest expression of legislative purpose. However, the superior court should have considered the voter's alternative theory that entry of the TRO made him the prevailing party under Alaska R. Civ. P. 82. The TRO allowed the voter to participate in the election process without any party affiliation.</SPAN></P>

Appellants moved to dismiss the appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The initiative committee submitted an initiative that proposed to determine the manner in which vacancies in Alaska's two U.S. Senate seats would be filled. The trial court ruled that the constitutionality of the initiative should not be considered unless and until the voters enacted the initiative into law. The court held that the appeal was not moot in that the passage of H.B. 414 and the proposed initiative were not &quot;substantially the same&quot; in that H.B. 414 retained the governor's temporary appointment power when a senate vacancy might arise. The two did not share a common purpose in that H.B. 414 would allow an unelected executive appointee to fill a vacant Senate seat for an interim period that could last as long as five months. Because the subject matter at issue was not specifically barred from the initiative process under Alaska Const. art. XI, &sect; 7, nor &quot;clearly inapplicable&quot; under Alaska Const. art. XII, &sect; 11, nor was its resolution clear under controlling authority, the proposed initiative met the test for submission to the voters. Its ultimate compliance with the Seventeenth Amendment fell outside the proper scope of the lieutenant governor's pre-election review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1981, the employee suffered a back injury during the course of his employment. In 1997, the employer controverted the employee's claims for prescription medication for the back injury. Relying on the results of an independent medical examination, the employer claimed that the employee no longer needed narcotics and benzodiazepines. In 1999, the employee filed another claim, contesting the employer's refusal to pay the 1997 bills. In 2001, the employee filed another claim, seeking payment for medical expenses that he had incurred since 1997. The trial court upheld the Board's decision dismissing the employee's three claims on the ground that they were time-barred under &sect; 23.30.110(c). On appeal, the court agreed that the 1997 and 1999 claims were properly dismissed. However, the court held that the 2001 claim should not have been dismissed. The employee did not simply refile the 1997 claim in 2001; rather, he sought compensation for different expenses. Because the 2001 claim was independent of the 1997 and 1999 claims, and because the employee requested a hearing less than two years after the employer controverted his 2001 claim, the claim was not time-barred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the employee's 1997 and 1999 claims. The court reversed the dismissal of the employee's 2001 claim and remanded the case for further proceedings on that claim.</SPAN></P>

The injunction compelled petitioner State of Alaska to include, despite the candidate's noncompliance with such laws, the candidate's name and party on the November 2004 general ballot for United States Senator. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the third-party candidate's political party had earned official party status until 2002 in a prior election, the State later revoked that status after it determined that the political party did not meet Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.60.010(21)'s three percent threshold for party recognition by way of earned votes in a 2002 election. The third-party candidate successfully argued that the three percent requirement for recognition as a political party was an unconstitutional infringement on ballot access, violating free speech and equal protection under the Alaska Constitution. The State argued that the third-party candidate made no clear showing of probable success on his constitutional claim; therefore, the injunction was improper. The appellate court held that because the three percent figure remained in the mainstream of the practices of other states, the third-party candidate failed to show that he was entitled to a preliminary injunction based on a clear probability of success on the merits, nor could it discern any valid legal ground in the trial court's opinion leading to the conclusion that the legislature acted unreasonably in enacting a three percent polling requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fisher argued that the regulation, which created a cooperative fishery in the Chignik area and allocated a quota of salmon to that fishery, was invalid on grounds it exceeded the scope of the Board's authority; was inconsistent with the statutory definition of &quot;fishery&quot; under the Alaska Limited Entry Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.43.010 et seq.; was inconsistent with the Act's purpose and policy; and was unconstitutional. The court held that the regulation was fundamentally at odds with the Limited Entry Act and was invalid. The regulation employed means outside the Board's authorized powers to allocate salmon within a single fishery and fundamentally contradicted the intended purposes of the Limited Entry Act. It transformed the limited entry permit from what used to be a personal gear license into a mere ownership share in a cooperative organization. However, before this regulatory scheme accomplished such a radical departure from the historical model of limited entry fisheries in Alaska and the spirit of the Limited Entry Act, the legislature would have to authorize the Board to approve cooperative salmon fisheries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose from a fire at the insured's home. The statute of limitations began running on September 2, 1998, when the insurers' investigator sent his letter to the insured offering a detailed explanation for the denial of his claim. The insured filed his complaint alleging bad faith in that denial on September 12, 2002. The Alaska statute of limitations for tort actions was two years, and the statute for contract actions was three years. The insured's complaint was thus late regardless of how the claim was characterized. However, he argued that the insurers should be estopped from relying on the statute of limitations and that the statute should be tolled. But, the insured's appellate claim that the insurers should be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense was a new argument and was waived because he did not raise it in the superior court. Also, in Alaska, the doctrine of equitable tolling did not apply as the insured had not pursued any other remedy. Finally, even with seven months' tolling for mental incapacity, the insured's claim was untimely as a matter of law and was barred by the statutes of limitations for both tort and contract actions.</SPAN></P>

The father had previously challenged the constitutionality of Alaska R. Civ. P. 90.3. The judge denied that challenge in a July 2002 order, relying on the Alaska Supreme Court's decision in Coghill v. Coghill. The judge reiterated that ruling in the instant order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father challenged the constitutionality of rule 90.3 on the grounds that: (1) the supreme court lacked the authority to create a child support rule; (2) rule 90.3 was vague and overbroad; and (3) rule 90.3's financial disclosure requirements violated his rights to due process and privacy and his right against self-incrimination. The supreme court held that rule 90.3 was constitutional. Inter alia, the father argued that &quot;the best interests of the child&quot; provisions of the rule were unconstitutionally vague. He maintained that there was no statutory definition for &quot;the best interest of the child&quot; and, therefore, it was broad, vague, and opinionated, which made the application of the phrase unconstitutional. The father failed to demonstrate how the superior court's exercise of discretion in his case was unfair or inequitable, nor did he distinguish Coghill. The supreme court concluded that rule 90.3 was not vague and that its previous holding in Coghill was not clearly erroneous. The supreme court also saw no reason to conclude that its previous holding that the percentage of income approach had a fair and substantial relationship to the goals of rule 90.3 was clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the grandparents of an orphaned child, filed suit in the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage against appellee State alleging negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), and violation of constitutional rights in relation to a child-in-need-of-aid (CINA) and adoption proceeding relating to their grandchild. The trial court dismissed the case. The grandparents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by dismissing the IIED claim. The supreme court agreed. The legal determination whether there was an actionable duty of care had little if any conceptual relevance to an IIED claim. The concept of a &quot;duty of care&quot; was usually identified with negligence claims and had no obvious bearing on a claim of intentional and outrageous conduct; the intentionality of the outrageous conduct needed for an IIED claim presupposed at least some intended relationship between the actor and the person harmed. The D.S.W. factors were typically applied to determine whether there was an actionable duty of care when there was no existing or intended relationship between the actor and the person harmed. Because the claim was dismissed on the pleadings, there was no opportunity to consider whether the grandparents' evidence could surmount the thresholds for the severity of any emotional distress and the outrageousness of the actor's conduct. Therefore, the claim was improperly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations claimed that they were entitled to a &quot;discovery royalty&quot; rate because they were the first producers to discover oil in a new geologic structure. The Department of Natural Resources Director denied the application finding that the reservoir in question was not a newly discovered geologic structure as defined by former Alaska Admin. Code tit. 11, &sect; 505.741(b) (1965). The Department Commissioner affirmed. The court held that the Alaska regulations in place when the lease was signed made it clear that the Department was not confined to a mechanical application of the known-geologic-structure test. The Commissioner's method of determining geologic structure was similar to the federal test, and the Commissioner's decision did not conflict with the definition of a geologic structure set out in former &sect; 505.741(b). Also, because the criteria for participating areas differed from those for awarding discovery royalty rights, a location's exclusion from or approval as a participating area did not determine its status as a separate geologic structure. Finally, the Commissioner's failure to allow representation at the corporations' hearing amounted to harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The miner appealed, but the trial court dismissed the appeal on the basis that the claims were forfeited as a matter of law. On appeal, the court held that the DNR acted within its delegated authority to establish a deadline for annual labor, and the state's choice of September 1 was reasonable and not arbitrary. Furthermore, regulations requiring payment of cash in lieu of labor by September 1 and deeming claims abandoned if payment was not received by that date were consistent with &sect; 38.05.210, were reasonable and not arbitrary, and were consistent with the Alaska Const. art. VIII, &sect; 11. However, the DNR erred in finding that the miner's payment was untimely when it was postmarked on September 1 and received on September 3. There was no apparent reason to impose forfeiture on a miner who mailed a payment of cash in lieu of labor on September 1, so long as the date of mailing could be verified through a postmark.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was terminated from one position after refusing to obey instructions not to use a State vehicle for personal errands, after his vehicle was observed parked outside a local bar on multiple occasions.

Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.25.010 only specified that separation &quot;for cause&quot; was required for permanent employees; the Personnel Rules promulgated by the Director of Personnel also limited just cause protection to permanent employees.  The rules entitled probationary employees such as the employee only to a written statement of the reasons for dismissal, which the employee received. The collective bargaining agreement explicitly limited the right to arbitrate demotion or dismissal decisions to permanent employees; it unmistakably waived probationary employees' right to arbitrate their termination grievances. The employee failed to raise a genuine dispute as to the State's motives for discharging him, so summary judgment on his claim for breach of an implied covenant of good faith was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlords sued appellees, the Executive Director of the Alaska State Commission for Human Rights, the Anchorage Equal Rights Commission, and the city, seeking a declaration that a statute and ordinance that banned them from refusing to rent to unmarried couples violated the U.S. Constitution. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, granted appellees summary judgment. The landlords appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the landlords' religion, cohabitation between an unmarried man and woman was a sin. Therefore, they argued, Alaska Stat. &sect; 8.80.240 and Anchorage, Alaska, Mun. Code &sect; 5.20.020, which required them to rent to unmarried couples, violated their right to free exercise of religion. The trial court found that controlling case law held to the contrary. On appeal, the court held that even though no sanctions had been imposed on the landlords, they had standing, as they would be exposed to civil and criminal liability unless they changed their rental practices. But they did not show any basis for overruling case law, as they failed to show the controlling decision was wrongly decided or that changed conditions required that it be abandoned. The trial court found that Alaska Stat. &sect; 18.80.240's exception for &quot;singles only&quot; and &quot;married couples only&quot; classes of housing had no discriminatory intent or impact, and the landlords did not show that this finding was wrong. The trial court's narrow construction of the statute and ordinance comported with their underlying purpose and defeated the landlords' vagueness and overbreadth claims. Their free speech arguments lacked independent merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the fisherman should receive an additional 18 points for participating in 1984 as a skipper, or an additional three points for participating that year as a crewmember, and an additional 15 points for income dependence. He was awarded an additional three points for participating as a crewmember in 1984 and an additional 15 points for income dependence on the fishery. He did not qualify for points as a skipper in 1984, as he had not owned an interim-use permit for this fishery that year and used the interim-use permit of a crewmember. The superior court affirmed the decisions. On appeal, the fisherman contended the maximum number of permits for this fishery was too low. Because CFEC considered past participation and other related factors, its decision regarding the maximum was reasonable and not arbitrary. Increasing the optimum number would not help the fisherman -- he would have to pay fair market value for an auctioned permit. Because Alaska Const. art. VIII, &sect; 15 authorized a limited entry system despite the implicit prohibition found in Alaska Const. art. VIII, &sect; 3, the fisherman's constitutional argument was meritless.</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 2, &sect; 50.327. Appellant political party (the party) appealed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The party sued, challenging the validity of Alaska Admin. Code tit. 2, &sect; 50.327, then moved for a preliminary injunction on the basis that the APOC lacked the authority to promulgate the regulation. The trial court ruled that the regulation was legally promulgated and denied injunctive relief. The party appealed. The soft money disclosure requirement fell within, at the very least, the implied authority of the APOC. Such disclosures informed the electorate and aided in the deterrence of corruption and the detection of violations of contribution limitations. Such requirements served the expressed legislative purpose of the Campaign Finance Statutes from which the APOC derived its authority to restore the public's trust in the electoral process and to foster good government. The regulation at issue, requiring that political parties report soft money contributions and expenditures, implemented the Campaign Disclosure Act by facilitating the enforcement of hard money limits. It also deterred practices that could reasonably be regarded as efforts to evade those limits and advanced the public informational goals of the act. The regulation was consistent with the Campaign Disclosure Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual argued that the superior court erred when it failed to allow him to amend his compliant. He asserted that the superior court's entry of judgment was arbitrary. In this case, the individual suffered little hardship as a result of the denial of his motion to amend. Because the claim the individual sought to add was at best tangentially related to his original claim, and the individual suffered little or no hardship as a result of the denial of the amendment, the superior court did not abuse its discretion. As to whether required disclosures were made, the individual failed below and before the supreme court to identify any specific failure on the part of the DEC to make a required Alaska R. Civ. P. 26 disclosure. The individual had provided no evidence of misrepresentations or documents being withheld by DEC. The superior court's failure to compel discovery was not an abuse of discretion. Finally, as to damages, the individual also failed to make out even a prima facie case of unjust enrichment that would justify awarding restitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a property owner, sued defendants, a borough and the city, claiming that certain ordinances violated his constitutional rights. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Palmer, dismissed his claim because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The property owner appealed, asserting he was unable to exhaust his administrative remedies because he was unable to pay a $ 200 administrative filing fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner operated a &quot;metal recycling&quot; business. Borough officials issued the property owner a notice of violation of land use codes regulating &quot;junk and trash&quot; and governing the disposal of junked cars. The Alaska Supreme Court took judicial notice of the fact that all of the laws challenged were borough, not city, ordinances. Thus, the supreme court dismissed the city from the action. Further, in his previous lawsuit the property owner argued that he was not required to exhaust administrative remedies, while in the instant case, he argued that the borough's filing fees prevented him from exhausting administrative remedies. Thus, collateral estoppel did not preclude his claims in the instant action. The primary issue on appeal was whether the &quot;mandatory filing fee&quot; infringed on the property owner's constitutional due process right to access the courts. The supreme court held that because access to the borough's administrative appeals process required a flat fee from all litigants regardless of their wealth, and because that process was a prerequisite to accessing the legal system, the borough's policy violated the procedural due process rights of indigent litigants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because it was unclear whether the property owner was actually indigent, the supreme court remanded the matter to the superior court for a factual determination of that question and for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks, which denied him relief on his claims that his constitutional rights were violated when he was forced to register under the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act (ASORA), Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 12.63.010-.100. He had received a suspended imposition of sentence (SIS), and his conviction had been set aside under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.55.085(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's set-aside was founded on judicial findings that he presented no significant risk to the community. With respect to defendant's responsibilities flowing from his conviction, they precluded subsequent reconsideration whether he posed a significant risk of committing the same offense again. The court held that applying ASORA to a person whose conviction was set aside before ASORA became specifically applicable to convictions that were set aside violated the Alaska Constitution's guarantee of due process. The court found specifically that applying ASORA to defendant burdened his fundamental liberty interests and right to procedural fairness arising out of the set-aside granted him. There was no legitimate reason to think that defendant presented such a danger that the State's post-set-aside interference with his liberty interests was justified. Absent the likelihood that defendant would commit new sex offenses, there was no compelling government interest in requiring defendant to do the things ASORA demanded. The State had failed to establish that the application was justified by a compelling governmental interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause for entry of an order enjoining the State from publishing defendant's personal information and requiring it to return all information defendant provided when he registered under protest.</SPAN></P>

In a declaratory judgment action filed by the juvenile and appellee other juveniles, appellant municipality appealed a decision of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, that the ordinance was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the declaratory action the juvenile and others the constitutionality of the curfew ordinance, which was later renumbered as Anchorage, Ala., Mun. Ordinance 8.75.060. The trial court decision in that case conflicted with the hearing officer's decision on constitutionality in the juvenile's individual case. The court consolidated the appeals and held that the ordinance was constitutional on its face. The court rejected the claim that the ordinance and its many exceptions were vague, holding that it was phrased with sufficient clarity so that ordinary people could understand what conduct was prohibited. The court also held that the ordinance did not violate equal protection rights. The right to move about was a fundamental right so the court applied strict scrutiny in its review. The court held that the municipality had a compelling interest in protecting minors from crime and curbing juvenile crime and that the curfew law was the least restrictive means for achieving both goals. The court rejected the equal protection challenge based on the exception for emancipated or married minors because such minors were adults by law under Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 25.20.020 and 09.55.590(g).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the hearing officer in the juvenile's ordinance citation case and reversed the decision in the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struck the victim with her automobile and left the scene. Police subsequently obtained a sample of defendant's breath, showing an illegal alcohol content, but defendant was not arrested. The supreme court held its previous decision requiring that, when an officer took a sample of a suspect's breath, as authorized by Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.031(g), a contemporaneous arrest was required to allow admission of the test results, was error, and a contemporaneous arrest was not required, as long as a recognized exception to the warrant requirement was present. In this case, the search of defendant's breath was constitutional, if exigent circumstances were present, as the other requirements of probable cause and reasonable procedures were satisfied, given defendant's inculpatory statements and lack of challenge to the procedures used to obtain a sample of her breath. In the context of this case, &sect; 28.35.031(g) incorporated, in addition to statutory requirements, the exigent circumstances requirements. The officer had probable cause to believe a search of defendant's breath would produce relevant evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the court of appeals was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court to determine if exigent circumstances justified a warrantless search of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged an order of the Superior Court, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks (Alaska), which awarded custody of her child with appellee father to intervenors, the paternal grandparents, and awarded child support to the grandparents from both parents. The trial court also awarded to the grandparents visitation with the mother's other child, who was unrelated to the grandparents, under Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.20.060(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents intervened, without objection, in the mother's motion for a modification of custody. The trial court granted legal and physical custody of the child to the grandparents, subject to the mother's visitation rights. The order also granted the grandparents visitation with the child's step-brother. The court rejected the mother's claim that the grandparents lacked standing because she did not object to their intervention or their motion for custody on standing grounds. The court held that, to overcome the parental preference, the grandparents had to show by clear and convincing evidence that the mother was unfit, or that the welfare of the child required the child to be in their custody because the child would suffer clear detriment in the custody of the mother. Because the trial court had used a preponderance of the evidence standard, a remand was necessary for the trial court to consider whether the higher standard had been met. The court held that the visitation provisions of &sect; 25.20.060, were facially constitutional and constitutional as applied, as construed by the court. However, third-party visitation was also subject to a clear and convincing standard of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the custody and visitation awards to the grandparents and affirmed the child support award. The case was remanded for the trial court's determination of whether the substantive standards for third-party custody had been satisfied by clear and convincing evidence, and whether the mother's visitation preference was overcome by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals also ruled that the preliminary breath test did not fall within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement, because defendant was not placed under arrest before or substantially contemporaneously with the search. The supreme court held that an arrest was not a prerequisite to a valid exigent circumstances warrantless breath test. The supreme court further held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.031(g) satisfied minimal constitutional requirements for warrantless searches when exigent circumstances existed.
