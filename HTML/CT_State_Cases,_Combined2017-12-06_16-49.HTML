Defendants' actions were directly related to their employment and could not be construed to have been motivated by personal considerations, thus making their actions fall within the scope of their employment; furthermore, plaintiff had not alleged that defendants acted with a wanton, reckless, or malicious mental state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband moved to vacate a divorce decree providing that he would contribute to the support of minor children and pay the wife a lump sum. There was no evidence that the trial court failed to properly apply the Child Support Guidelines, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-215b. Because the husband failed to submit the required Guidelines Worksheet, he was precluded from complaining of the trial court's alleged failure to comply with the Guidelines. There was no evidence that either party suffered from a mental or physical impediment that would prevent their freely entering into the separation agreement.</SPAN></P>

There was no provision in the statute for notice to the biological parents, who were non-custodial and whose rights had not been terminated. This appeared to be a fatal due process flaw.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagors purchased an apartment complex and in order to finance it, a note and mortgage were executed. The mortgagee's assignor allegedly failed to negotiate a workout of the loan after the mortgagor indicated that it could no longer make payments due to the downturn in the economy. Instead, it refused to negotiate a loan modification and proceeded with the foreclosure. The court previously struck the mortgagor's revised counterclaims. The mortgagor filed an answer, special defenses, and new revised counterclaims, which the mortgagee again sought to strike. The court noted that the new revised counterclaims were identical to those previously stricken. Accordingly, the same reasons that warranted their being stricken previously still controlled. The special defenses all related to the failure to negotiate a loan modification. The use of the Troubled Assets Relief Program was not a valid defense, and equitable estoppel was not shown. A violation of CUTPA was not a valid defense, and no breach of fiduciary duty or of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was shown by resort to the judicial process upon the mortgagors' default. Other defenses also lacked merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-230 with failure to remove accumulation of garbage and rubbish, improper storage of junk material, and failure to prevent mosquito breeding from stagnant water. He filed a motion to dismiss the information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that the three counts of violating &sect; 19a-230 implicitly referenced violations of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 19a-206, 19a-210, and 19a-213. The court held that the only way to reconcile &sect;&sect; 19a-230 and 19a-206 was to read &quot;for which no other penalty is provided&quot; in &sect;19a-230 as &quot;for which no other criminal penalty is provided.&quot; In this way, because &sect; 19a-206 provided only a civil penalty, but not a criminal penalty, then a charge under &sect; 19a-230 could stand. Next, the record was insufficient for the court to find facts necessary to make a determination as to the vagueness of &sect; 19a-213. The State did not lack standing to bring an action to enforce &sect; 19a-210 on the ground that the statute authorized action by a town health director upon the written complaint of any person having an interest in any land. The required verifiable interest in land was not present. Finally, because &sect; 19a-206 was akin to a strict liability statute, and because there was some evidence to determine that defendant was issued a warning, the court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the count for violation of &sect; 19a-206 on the ground that the State had not met the mens rea requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sued defendants, a public defender (defender) and public defender service commission (commission), for (1) a declaration that their acts and omissions violated his state and federal rights, (2) a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering them to adhere to a settlement in another case regarding inmates' confinement conditions, (3) a declaratory judgment, and (4) a jury trial on all triable issues. Defendants moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defender said service of process was not proper. This claim failed because the defender conceded a second service of process was proper. The commission was not properly served because (1) after it denied service occurred at its address or on its agent, the inmate did not show service was properly effected, and (2) serving the commission instead of the Attorney General, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-64, rendered service improper. The defender was immune because the suit was, in effect, against the state, as (1) he was a state official, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-141, (2) he was sued for his duties as a public defender, (3) the inmate's confinement conditions claims were beyond his authority, as the department of correction placed inmates, and (4) inmate placement subjected the state to liability, not the defender, so sovereign immunity, not statutory immunity applied. Sovereign immunity barred the suit because (1) the state did not consent to be sued, (2) the inmate did not allege the defender acted beyond his authority, and (3) the inmate did not allege he acted under an unconstitutional statute, so the court had no subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed a decision of defendant Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) which dismissed their appeal from the zoning enforcement officer's (ZEO) action on their zoning application and denied their variance requests. The issues involved the application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8-6 and 8-8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners had applied for several variances in order to build a home on the subject property, which was in a residential zone. All nearby lots had single family houses. The court held the ZBA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in affirming the decision of the ZEO to deny the zoning application. The ZEO applied another 100-foot setback which had a different name from those 100-foot setbacks considered and ruled on in a prior court's decision. In doing so the ZEO both ignored the prior court ruling and the prior application of the regulations to similar situations by the same ZEO. The ZEO and the ZBA applied an unusual and improper interpretation of the regulations when it found the &quot;rear yard&quot; to be in effect the entire boundary of the lot except for the north or front thereof, which was inconsistent with other determinations with similar shaped lots. The ZEO stated that the plans did not make it possible to determine if construction would comply with the Flood Hazard Requirements. But there was no evidence to confirm such a finding. The ZBA abused its discretion when it denied the requested variances. It appeared that the ZBA could reasonably reach only one conclusion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a contested case which was joined by intervenor corporation, the Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) made certain rulings, including one that the $10 per megawatt hour minimum value established by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-243t(a) applied when a Class III Renewable Energy Credit (REC) was sold or otherwise transacted. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that the DPUC reasonably construed the phrase &quot;a REC shall not be less than one-cent per kilowatt hour&quot; in &sect; 16-243t(a) not to apply to a REC that had expired. Under the DPUC's construction, the statutory meaning was that an expired REC, like any other expired item or service, ceased to have value after the time of its expiration. An REC was analogous to a line of credit--once it expired, it had no value. Next, the DPUC did not err in not increasing the Renewable Portfolio Standards percentage mandated for purchase by an electric distribution company under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-243q(a). The corporation was essentially contending that the DPUC should, in light of the oversupply of RECs, amend the statutory language to increase the minimum requirements for purchase. The court could not force the DPUC to adopt a position that did not track its authority. Finally, the DPUC did not err in conducting quarterly rather than annual audits under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-1(a)(44). The legislature had left to the DPUC the task of &quot;filling in the blanks&quot; with regard to the timing of its audit, and there was no prohibition on it changing its approach based upon experience.</SPAN></P>

They did not mention the contingencies in Conn. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(d)(1) because they did not discuss securing a dissolution of marriage or civil union, nor did they mention alimony, support, property settlement, or any financial matters. They did not contain the factors applicable to contingency fee arrangements because they did not (1) mention a &quot;res&quot; against which to charge a fee, (2) provide a way to calculate the fee, or (3) state no fee was due if a contingency was not met. They did not violate Conn. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(d)(1) because (1) they mentioned factors in Conn. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a) for determining the reasonableness of a fee, and (2) no additional fee would be charged if the client did not approve, consistent with Conn. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(b). The agreements were not improper because Conn. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5(a)(4) let an attorney charge a reasonable fee based on the amount involved and the results obtained.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-229. The DPH upheld a cease and desist order issued by a city health director due to the ME's violation of various city ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ME was a tenant of the landlord's property, and it operated a tanning salon and massage parlor. In issuing the cease and desist order, it was noted that the ceiling light fixtures were covered by aluminum foil, there was no linen service to ensure sanitary towels, and employees resided there. Further, none of the employees were licensed as massage therapists. The DPH, after a hearing, upheld the order. On appeal, the court noted that the factual findings of the DPH hearing officer (HO) were supported by substantial evidence. The ME waived its right to argue on appeal that the HO erred in not reviewing a particular violation that required a local business permit, and the landlord did not show prejudice. A clear admission by the ME's manager during the administrative inspection was properly accepted into evidence. State regulation of massage practitioners under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-206a et seq. did not pre-empt the city's ordinances where no irreconcilable conflict was shown. The court declined to review the constitutionality of the city ordinances. Pursuant to the language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-206(b), the order was properly applied against both the ME and the landlord.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the State of Connecticut and various state officials, filed a motion to dismiss all but one count of an action by plaintiff state retiree, on the grounds of sovereign, qualified, and statutory immunity under, inter alia, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. The retiree alleged that as a workers' compensation (WC) recipient, he was required to pay higher premiums for his health care than retirees who did not receive WC.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retiree received WC benefits as a result of an injury. He made monthly payments to maintain his health care insurance. He filed his purported class action as a multi-count suit against the State and assorted state officials. Defendants sought dismissal based on various types of immunity. The court noted that the retiree's claim for the refund of premiums that were allegedly overpaid was an employment benefit, such that it was the type listed in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-142(1). Accordingly, it was excepted from jurisdiction of the claims commissioner. The court concluded that the State and the officials in their official capacities waived sovereign immunity for such claims. The doctrine of ejusdem generis was inapplicable with respect to exceptions to &sect; 4-142. The retiree's claims as to violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV were within the exception to sovereign immunity, and as to claims under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, immunity was waived under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-290a. Claims of breach of contract and unjust enrichment were also within the waiver of immunity. Other statutory claims were not within the immunity waiver, and the issues were not moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied dismissal as to the counts alleging constitutional and civil rights violations, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment against the State and the officials in their official capacities. The remainder of the dismissal motion was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate said the opponent was unqualified to serve. The candidate lacked standing because (1) no statute let her seek pre-election declaratory relief, as no pre-election relief statute applied, Conn. Gen.

Stat. &sect; 52-491, on quo warranto suits to oust an unqualified office holder, only applied after an election, and (2) the candidate was not classically aggrieved, as she sought no declaration of her own rights, her untimely suit did not protect the public interest in orderly elections, and she showed no right not to run against candidates unqualified to serve. Sovereign immunity barred claims against the secretary of the state because (1) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-329b did not waive immunity, as its phrase &quot;improperly on the ballot&quot; only applied to candidates procedurally unqualified to run, and (2) she cited no statutes letting the secretary of the state evaluate a candidate's qualifications for office, under Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrator sought the judges' knowledge of facts pertaining to a claim against the state pending in the office of the claims commissioner which arose out of a shooting in a public parking lot outside of a courthouse. The administrator argued that the relief requested sought only discovery, and not any damages or affirmative equitable relief that could adversely affect the state. The court however, agreed with the judges that the action affected the state in three significant ways. First, the depositions sought were in connection with the pending claims in which the administrator sought the right to sue the state for damages. Information obtained in the depositions potentially may have been used against the state in a possible future action. Second, the judges' time consumed in preparing for and giving depositions would have diminished their availability to fulfill their judicial duties. Third, the independent action for a bill of discovery affected the state in that it undermined the legislatively established method for determining claims against the state as set forth at Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-151(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Central to all counts was the inmate's allegation that he was convicted by a jury of 11 jurors and one &quot;non-juror,&quot; because the trial court discharged a juror and substituted an alternate juror after the beginning of deliberations. The State conceded that the trial court failed to comply with the mandates of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-82h(c), but argued that any resultant error was harmless. The court agreed that the inmate failed to demonstrate any harm flowing from the substitution of the alternate juror. The trial court's actions in connection with the substitution of the alternate juror were sufficient to prevent prejudice and to protect the integrity and fairness of the trial. While the error that occurred in the inmate's criminal trial might have entitled him to relief on appeal, it was not of constitutional dimension, and did not rise to the level of being a miscarriage of justice or other prejudice that warranted habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the State of Connecticut, through its Department of Transportation (DOT), filed a ten-count complaint against defendants, four related outdoor advertising entities and a tree service, seeking damages, on various theories of liability, for the unauthorized cutting and removal of trees from certain parcels of State property. The DOT filed a motion for summary judgment as to liability only. Defendants filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOT issued a permit to the entities to trim trees and shrubs along an interstate, within the right-of-way of the State. The DOT alleged defendants removed trees at three locations: (1) the permitted location; (2) within the highway right-of-way but outside of the permitted location (non-permitted location); and (3) on abutting State property. Counts one, three, five, seven, and nine, alleged each defendant violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13a-140 and 23-65. The remaining counts alleged common law trespass against each defendant. The parties' dispute on the trespass counts primarily involved whether defendants acted with the requisite intent to constitute a trespass. Defendants intentionally entered the abutting State property to cut and remove trees. Further, defendants' cutting and removal of trees from the permitted and non-permitted locations was not privileged because the condition precedent placed on the permission to enter the permitted and non-permitted locations by the State was never met. Defendants violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13a-140 and 23-65 by failing to apply in writing for a permit or obtain a written permit to cut and remove trees in the three locations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DOT's motion for summary judgment as to liability on counts three through ten of the complaint was granted, defendants' motions for summary judgment on those counts was denied, and all parties' motions for summary judgment with respect to counts one and two, against one advertising entity, was deferred for later adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner (PO) filed an inverse condemnation proceeding against defendant, the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), alleging that the DEP's issuance and recording of a final administrative order, requiring the PO to abate pollution, caused an unconstitutional taking of certain portions of the property. The PO sought just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DEP alleged that portions of the PO's lots were environmentally contaminated with soil and water pollution, as well as solid waste. Based on the DEP's administrative order, which was affirmed on appeal, the PO asserted that it was unable to sell or lease the property, such that an unconstitutional taking occurred under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. After a trial on the claims and the DEP's special defenses, the court found that the order was not preventing the property from having a reasonable use, as there was no direct evidence from any prospective purchaser or lessee. Further, the PO failed to show sufficient proof that the subject lots were uncontaminated. Rather, the court found that issuance of the DEP order was a valid exercise of the State's police power pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-434 of the Water Pollution Control Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-416 et seq., and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-225 of the Solid Waste Management Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-207 et seq. The PO failed to take the legally required action to abate the problem. The PO's challenge to the factual and legal underpinnings of the order were barred by collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court found, plaintiff was required to demonstrate that the State had statutorily waived sovereign immunity. Plaintiff, however, failed to provide any relevant authority that purported to waive the State's sovereign immunity. Consequently, in the absence of waiver, to seek monetary damages from the State, plaintiff was required to bring his claim before the claims commissioner pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-142, 4-160(a). Plaintiff failed to show that he had done so. Further, the complaint was devoid of sufficient facts to support a conclusion that the state officials were acting outside the scope of their employment or in a wanton, reckless, or malicious manner, and thus failed to overcome the Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 immunity. The complaint also alleged that two of the state officials failed to carry out a duty as state legislators. Plaintiff was therefore asserting that the basis for the alleged duty arose from legislative functions. Such a claim was barred by the speech or debate clause, Conn. Const. art.

On appeal, the commission argued that it had no authority to reinstate a nonconforming use that had been terminated. The landowner argued, inter alia, that the commission's denial of its earlier application was based upon a regulation which at the time was contrary to the penultimate sentence of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2, and that the commission amendment to the regulation made loss of nonconformity dependent upon intent rather than nonuse. Although the commission was bound to hear the second or subject application, the court concluded that it had no authority to reverse itself, as the recorded disclosed no material change in circumstances. The commission also raised the issues of collateral estoppel and res judicata, the former of which the court found applicable. The factual and legal issue in the instant action and in the former application were identical and the same issues were litigating and determined.

However, the court found that the Supreme Court of Connecticut had rejected this claim. Further, defendant's claims that the lack of standards to guide the state's attorneys' discretion rendered the death penalty scheme unconstitutional, that it was unconstitutional to impose the death penalty on those who did not themselves kill, and that the death penalty scheme violated the Eighth Amendment had been considered and rejected by the United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Connecticut, or both. The &quot;especially heinous, cruel or depraved&quot; constituted a unitary factor rather than three separate factors. The claim that the present judicial construction of the meaning of the &quot;especially heinous, cruel or depraved&quot; aggravating factor of Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital said the subpoena was improper because it was not a party to the case before the commissioner.

Stat. &sect; 4-151(e) allowed orders against &quot;any person,&quot; who refused to produce &quot;relevant&quot; documents. The subpoena did not exceed the commissioner's authority to find if a case presented an issue under which the state could be liable because its purpose was to decide foreseeability in a claim against state employees. The documents had to be produced because the standard was not if they &quot;related&quot; to state liability under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-160 but if, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-151(e), they were &quot;relevant&quot; and &quot;unprivileged.&quot; Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-17b's peer review privilege did not apply because it applied to civil actions, which did not include the case before the commissioner. The claims act, Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sellers said the arbitrator did not consider their economic loss doctrine (ELD) defense. The arbitrator violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-418(a)(4) because (1) an arbitration rule and agreement required findings and conclusions on each claim and defense, and (2) no reason for rejecting this doctrine was given. It was no error not to apply a time limit in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-134(3)(A) to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-134(3)(B) because (1) the limit unambiguously did not so apply, so reference to extratextual materials was improper, and, (2) if such a reference were proper, submitted materials were not &quot;official&quot; agency interpretations of long standing. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-2z's enactment after the parties' transaction did not make it inapplicable because it was a retroactive procedural statute. The arbitrator correctly held Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577c did not time-bar a claim because (1) no injury or damage from exposure to a environmental pollutant was claimed, and, (2) if it applied, non-reviewable factual findings showed the claim was timely.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was sentenced for third-degree sexual assault in 1991, filed an application for exemption from sex offender requirements under Megan's Law, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-250 et seq. He argued that the requirements were punitive as applied to him and thus violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that first, sex offender registration imposed no affirmative disability or restraint upon defendant. It did not restrict where he could live, but merely required him to notify law enforcement officials of where he resided. Second, registration was not something that had historically been regarded as punishment. Third, sex offender registration was not something that promoted the traditional aims of punishment--retribution or deterrence. To the contrary, the aim of requiring sex offenders to register was to promote public safety and to assist law enforcement. Fourth, the statutory scheme regarding sex offender registration was rationally connected to these legitimate, non-punitive aims. Finally, the requirements were not excessive, as the laws provided for a &quot;sliding scale&quot; of registration based on the nature of the offense and the type of victim. It was not excessive merely because defendant's victim had passed away and the dissemination of the information was restricted. Defendant was convicted of forcible sexual contact with his ex-wife. Lifetime registration was appropriate for individuals who subjected others to sexual contact against their will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's application for exemption from the sex offender registration. It also found that Connecticut's Megan's Law was constitutional as applied to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-76c(b)(1) conferred upon the prosecutor the unilateral authority to transfer a case which alleged the commission of a felony for the youthful offender docket to the adult criminal docket of a superior court, without a hearing. The court concluded that &sect; 54-76c(b)(1) allowed the State to unilaterally transfer a case from the youthful offender docket to the adult criminal docket. While the court found that subject language unclear and ambiguous, the court found that, pursuant to the legislative history, the intent of the legislature was to deprive the judicial authority of any discretion in the transfer of any felony matter from the youthful offender docket to the adult docket, and to repose in the prosecutor sole authority to transfer a felony matter once the court exercised its limited authority for the finding of probable cause. The court found no separation of powers violation. Finally, the court concluded that defendant failed to demonstrate that he had a vested liberty interest in his youthful offender status that was cognizable under the due process clauses of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 or the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor lived with his mother in Colorado and the grandparents were the minor's legal guardians. In support of their motion, the grandparents argued that the brother's petition had to be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, because the brother lacked standing and could not satisfy the jurisdictional prerequisites of Troxel v. Granville or Roth v. Weston. Alternatively, if the court concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the brother's application, the grandparents argued that Connecticut was an inconvenient forum under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-115q. The court first concluded that Troxel and Roth were inapplicable to the instant matter, and the court had jurisdiction over the brother's petition. The petition alleged that the mother was not a fit parent, and Troxel and Roth were based on the presumption that fit parents act in their children's best interest. The court further concluded that a motion to dismiss based on &sect; 46b-115q was procedurally inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lender filed a foreclosure action against defendants, a borrower and another. Defendants filed an answer in which they asserted nine special defenses and four counterclaims based upon the lender's alleged refusal to negotiate a loan modification and its decision to proceed with the foreclosure action. The borrower filed a motion to strike special defenses two through nine, all four counterclaims, and prayers for relief two through four.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' special defenses/counterclaims included, inter alia, a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), vicarious liability, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. The court found that an alleged violation of CUTPA was properly brought as a counterclaim to foreclosure actions, rather than as a special defense. For purposes of the counterclaim, the lender's refusal to negotiate with defendants and going forward with foreclosure simply did not rise to the level of a violation of CUTPA. Although the court followed a more lenient application of the making, validity, and enforcement limitation, defendants' special defenses/counterclaims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing were legally insufficient because the lender's conduct, in refusing to negotiate a loan modification and proceeding to foreclosure, did not rise to the level of a breach of the aforementioned duties. Defendants' allegations against the lender's agent regarding a refusal to negotiate a loan modification was legally insufficient to support the vicarious liability special defense/counterclaims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff motorist, who was injured in an auto accident while in the course of her employment, sued defendant driver for negligence. Plaintiff's employer, which sought to recover workers' compensation benefits it paid to plaintiff, was allowed to intervene. After a jury awarded plaintiff damages and defendant's insurer tendered the full amount of defendant's policy, the employer filed a motion for apportionment under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-293.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer paid $ 300,000 of the $ 1.38 million award. Plaintiff's attorney received his $ 100,000 contingency fee; the remainder was escrowed. The employer had paid over $ 235,000 in workers' compensation benefits and argued that under &sect; 31-293(a) it was entitled to all the remaining funds. Plaintiff argued that as she had not received all of her economic and non-economic damages, granting apportionment would violate her rights to access to the court under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, the state Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, and the make-whole doctrine. The court disagreed. The common law make-whole doctrine was overridden by &sect; 31-293, and she had access to the courts and to relief through the workers' compensation laws. Her equal protection claim failed, as no fundamental right was involved and any alleged classification was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. Apportioning liability according to the percentage of the amount awarded paid by the employer would violate &sect; 31-293. Plaintiff's request for additional costs was untimely. But as the case was being appealed, deduction of reasonable appellate attorneys fees before apportionment was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that $ 30,000 was to remain in escrow until it determined the amount of the appellate legal fees and costs; the balance of the funds held in escrow, $ 170,000, was ordered turned over to the employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writer alleged that he wrote a weekly consumer &quot;watchdog&quot; column and web log for the newspaper and that he was fired because he wrote or intended to write articles about companies that advertised in the newspaper exposing consumer complaints or investigations by the Connecticut attorney general. In support of their motion to strike, defendants argued that the writer's wrongful discharge count failed as a matter of law because he had no constitutional right to publish an article in the newspaper. The court concluded that newspaper's owners and editors had virtually the absolute right to determine what to publish and that the First Amendment protected their choices. The writer was a reporter and he had no federal or state constitutional right to publish anything in the newspaper; thus, the writer failed to state a claim for wrongful discharge under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-51q. Defendants also argued that the promissory estoppel claim failed because it was based upon the mission statement of the newspaper, which contained no specific promises.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a. The company filed a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that plaintiff's &sect; 14-154a claim was preempted by the Graves Amendment, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106, which barred vicarious liability claims against car rental companies. The appellate court agreed. It rejected plaintiff's contention that the Graves Amendment was unconstitutional, as the U.S. Supreme Court had that the Amendment was a valid exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Plaintiff argued that &sect; 30106(a)(2)'s savings clause allowed her to assert that the company was negligent in leasing the car to the driver without inquiring into his driving history, which involved  multiple alcohol related-offenses, reckless driving, and driving with a suspended license. The appellate court disagreed. No legal authority supported plaintiff's position that a rental car company had a duty to investigate a potential renter's driving record before entering into a rental agreement. Further, plaintiff introduced no case law, in Connecticut or elsewhere, recognizing the existence of an industry standard that required rental car companies to inquire into a renter's driving history or run a driving record report.</SPAN></P>

The tenants failed to pay the rent due for January 2010, and the landlord properly served them with a notice to quit possession. The tenants remained in possession, and filed a complaint about the condition of the premises after receiving the notice to quit. Neither the landlord nor his wife knew of the alleged defects on the property before the notice to quit was served. Prior to that time, the landlord timely responded to any complaints. The lease shifted the duty to supply water to the tenants, which was allowed under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-7(c). The lease clearly stated that use of the water on the premises had to be regulated due to the slow recovery of the well and that the landlord had no obligation to provide a better water supply. The tenants remained in possession despite experiencing problems with the water supply for over three years, which showed that the problem did not render the premises unfit or uninhabitable. The problems discovered during the inspection with the window screens, floors, and switch plates did not render the premises unfit. The tenants were not relieved of the duty to pay rent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the State of Connecticut, by the Connecticut Department of Information Technology (DOIT), filed suit against defendants, a corporation and its principal (corporation). The jury awarded the State no damages on its breach of contract claim, and found for the corporation on the rest of the complaint. The corporation was awarded $ 18.3 million plus punitive damages on a stigma plus due process counterclaim under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed motions to dismiss, to set aside the verdict and for a JNOV, and to reduce the verdict. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. The recoupment counterclaim exception did not apply. Assuming that a reasonably prompt name-clearing hearing would satisfy the due process concerns implicated, the suit did not do so in light of the 10-year delay in its resolution. Compensatory damages were available. The corporation was not collaterally estopped from asserting its state constitutional liberty claim as a result of a federal case. The evidence supported the jury's finding for the corporation on the stigma plus due process claim. However, the evidence did not support an inference of a sufficient proximate connection between the statements and an $ 18.3 million loss. The evidence might support an inference that DOIT's actions in charging that the corporation had committed fraud in the procurement and performance of government contracts and decision to blacklist the corporation from receiving information technology contracts adversely affected the corporation's business, but it did not show that it conduct proximately caused a total loss of the corporation's market value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's motion to dismiss was denied. The trial court granted the motion to reduce the jury's verdict and ordered an award in favor of the corporation and against the State of $ 1.83 million. In the absence of a filing from the corporation within 10 days indicating its acceptance of the remittitur and reduced award, the verdict was to be set aside and a new trial was to be ordered on the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accountant argued that the CP lacked standing as the complaint dealt with claims related to the estate, not claims related to the person, and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 45a-655 and 45a-656 limited the right to sue to the CE in such instances. The court noted that the CE's role was largely related to the conserved person's finances, while the CP's role was largely related to the conserved person's care and safety. Section 46a-655(a) authorized the CE to sue for and collect all debts due to the estate, while no such authority was given to the CP. As conservators had only those powers expressly or implicitly provided by statute,&nbsp;&sect;&sect; 45a-655 and 45a-656 implied that the CE, not the CP, was authorized to file the instant action. Plaintiffs claimed defendants converted the conserved person's jewelry; while jewelry was a &quot;personal effect&quot; subject to the CP's authority, it could also be deemed  &quot;personal property&quot; over which the CE had authority. The CP was not classically aggrieved, as she lacked a legal interest in the subject matter. As her role related to the conserved person's care and safety and did not relate to the management of her estate, she could not claim an injury as CP.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff physicians sued defendants, the Connecticut Division of Criminal Justice, the Chief State's Attorney, and 13 state's attorneys, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and asking the court to order the state's attorneys not to prosecute them, or other physicians, for manslaughter under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-56 if they provided &quot;aid in dying&quot; to terminally ill patients. Defendants moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both physicians were treating terminally ill patients. Defendants argued that their claims were not ripe or otherwise justiciable and were barred by sovereign immunity. The court held that as it was clear that &sect; 53a-56 applied to the physicians, there was no controversy. Further, amending &sect; 53a-56 so that it did not apply to them was not a controversy that could be adjudicated by a court, but was a task for the legislature. The physicians argued that if defendants prosecuted them for assisting patients to commit suicide, they would be acting in excess of their statutory authority and, therefore, the third exception to sovereign immunity applied. The court disagreed. Nothing in the text of &sect; 53a-56 and the common usage of the word &quot;suicide&quot; supported the physicians' claim that the choice of a mentally competent, terminally ill patient for a peaceful death by means of prescription medication did not constitute &quot;suicide&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 53a-56(a)(2). Thus, if defendants prosecuted the physicians for providing &quot;aid in dying&quot; in violation of &sect; 53a-56, they would be acting within the scope of their authority; therefore, they were protected by sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff abutter filed an appeal from a decision of the Killingworth, Connecticut, Planning and Zoning Commission (PZC) that granted defendant applicant a special exception to increase the number of commercially boarded horses from 13 to 18, to construct a new barn and an addition to a barn, to add parking spaces, and to expand the riding lessons it offered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that although the application, which was referenced in the notice of public hearing, referred to outdated section numbers of the zoning regulations, the purpose, nature, and location of the proposed activities were accurately described in the notice. The notice provided the public with a summary of the essential elements of the application and thus satisfied Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-3. Next, because the PZC correctly interpreted and applied the regulations, the decision setting forth the limit on the total number of horses was not erroneous. The zoning regulations were not void for vagueness in violation of due process. They could be reasonably applied to the facts of the subject application in only one way: to limit the total combined number of horses to 30. The requirement of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-3c(b) for the PZC to give due consideration to a wetlands agency report was satisfied where the agency unequivocally stated that no wetlands permit would be required and a copy of that statement was made part of the record. Finally, a regulatory requirement directing an applicant to submit a copy of a sanitation certificate with its application was directory, not mandatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the execution of a search warrant by Waterbury police officers in Watertown without the presence of Watertown police officers violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-281, which prohibited municipal police officers from executing search warrants in a municipality other than their own unless officers from that municipality were present. The officers' extraterritorial conduct was not per se a violation of the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV. as there was no requirement in the Fourth Amendment that the officer executing a warrant had to be acting within his or her jurisdiction. Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 did not encompass the Connecticut legislature's territorial restrictions on police conduct. The extraterritorial conduct of the Waterbury police officers did not, by itself, violate &sect; 7. Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 41-12 and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-33f did not grant a substantive right to suppression of evidence. There was no statute or precedent providing for suppression of seized evidence as a remedy for the searches conducted in violation of &sect; 7-281.

On January 31, 2006, prior to the agreement's execution, plaintiff lost its Connecticut insurance producer license. On February 26, 2008, defendant producer terminated the agreement because plaintiff lost its license. The evidence showed that defendant producer bargained for the right not to deal with an unlicensed entity. The parties intended that, from the agreement's inception, plaintiff would be licensed in Connecticut, its state of domicile. All parties were on notice that plaintiff's failure to maintain its Connecticut license for more than 90 days during the term of the agreement meant defendant producer could terminate the agreement. Plaintiff conceded the parties had agreed the rule of judicial interpretation that construed an ambiguity in a contract against its drafter did not apply. Plaintiff could not recover on unjust enrichment or quantum meruit theories because the parties had an operative contract. The breach of guaranty count against the parent could not stand because defendant producer was entitled to judgment on the underlying claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff town commenced an action against defendant architectural firm that sounded in common-law indemnity. The town had been sued in a personal injury action related to injuries allegedly suffered by a spectator at a ball game on a ball field owned by the town. The firm filed a motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations/repose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firm was alleged to have been responsible for the design of the field. As the field had reached substantial completion by 1992 when the town first used it, the seven-year limitation period in &sect; 52-584a(a) would ordinarily have expired in 1999, and the instant suit would be time barred. However, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-598a, a statute of limitations for indemnification actions, extended the seven-year repose period found in &sect; 52-584a(a) for actions against an architect, professional engineer, or land surveyor. Although it seemed that &sect; 52-598a defeated the policy of placing a finite barrier on actions against architects, as &sect; 52-598a was enacted after &sect; 52-584a, the court concluded that &sect; 52-598a superseded &sect; 52-584a. Section 52-598a did not violate the federal or state due process clauses as the firm never had an absolute right to repose. Further, while the personal injury suit had not yet been resolved, the question of indemnification was ripe for suit based on the pendency of the personal injury action. Section 52-598a did not require the town to wait until judgment or settlement in that suit before filing its indemnity action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, Connecticut's Secretary of the State, brought suit in her individual capacity as a declared candidate for the nomination of the Connecticut Democratic Party for the office of Attorney General (AG) to obtain a declaratory judgment (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-29) confirming that she was eligible to serve as AG. The Connecticut Republican Party intervened, asserting as a special defense that the Secretary's claim was nonjusticiable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In light of the facts, which had reached a point where final adjudication of the question presented was possible, the harsh alternatives, and the remedial purpose of the declaratory judgment statute, the court found the matter was exactly the kind of controversy for which the declaratory judgment statute was designed. The court interpreted Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3-124, which set out the requirements for the AG, and found that for the last eleven years the Secretary had regularly drawn upon her skill and training as a Connecticut attorney to issue rulings, instructions, and opinions concerning the administration of elections. She had regularly made herself available to give advice to local election officials in connection with properly conducting elections, as required of her under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-4. These requests had frequently required her to use her legal skill and training to give proper guidance to election officials for the benefit of the general public. By engaging in the performance of these services as Secretary of the State throughout her tenure in office, she had engaged in the active practice of law for at least ten years within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3-124.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment to declare, that the Secretary had engaged in active practice at the bar of Connecticut, within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3-124, for at least ten years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgagee filed suit against defendants, a mortgagor and its guarantor, seeking foreclosure, immediate possession, a deficiency judgment, monetary damages, attorneys fees, costs, and interest. The mortgagee's summary judgment motion was granted as to liability. The mortgagee was granted strict foreclosure and July 14, 2009, was set as the law day. The mortgagee filed a motion for judgment on damages on the claim against the guarantor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court noted that the motion was filed over five months after the law date. Under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-1 and 49-14, a mortgagee had to bring a deficiency action within 30 days of the law day. By bringing a motion for judgment, the mortgagee's motion bypassed the procedures set up under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-14(a) after former 49-14 was declared unconstitutional. The mortgagee attached an appraisal and an appraiser's affidavit to the mortgagee's motion for strict foreclosure. The appraiser determined the property was worth $ 50,000. The guarantor was not afforded an effective opportunity to be heard and proper notice thereof. The attachment of the appraiser's report and findings to the motion for judgment failed to give the guarantor the opportunity to probe the report for accuracy or to cross-examine the appraiser on his findings. The court had not had that opportunity to make a determination of the value of the property and the remaining debt on the note. Granting the motion would run counter to the safeguards guaranteed through a hearing and violate the statutes that governed strict foreclosures and deficiency judgments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former wife filed a motion to modify a child support order entered by a Massachusetts court, which defendant former husband had registered in Connecticut.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-71 required Connecticut courts to apply Massachusetts law to foreign domestic judgments, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-212 et seq., and the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738B, provided that the wife's motion was governed by Connecticut law because the parties and child now lived in that State. The court reconciled the conflict by applying Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-213q(f) of UIFSA, as its more specific provision regarding modifying foreign child support orders involving parents and children living in Connecticut controlled over the more general provisions of &sect; 46b-71. Under Connecticut's child support guidelines, the wife, as the party seeking modification, did not qualify for a deduction for her child from her new marriage, but the husband, as the party defending modification, did. Based on this deduction and the parties' current income, the presumptive support owed by the husband under the guidelines was less than the current child support order. Thus, the wife did not sustain her burden under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-86(a) of showing a substantial change of circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff beverage distributors sued defendants, the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and others, seeking a judgment declaring that 2009 Conn. Acts 01, &sect; 15 (the 2009 Act) effected a retroactive taking of their property in violation of U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV, and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11; an order enjoining the DEP from enforcing it; and money damages. Both sides moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The original Connecticut Bottle Bill, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-243 et seq., required all beverage distributors to pay a five cent refund for each returned empty container; money from unreturned bottles belonged to them. 2008 Conn. Acts 1, &sect; 11 (the 2008 Act), enacted on December 1, 2008, required distributors to deposit in interest-bearing accounts amounts equal to the refund values for each container sold; refunds had to be paid from such accounts. The 2009 Act, enacted on January 15, 2009 and effective April 1, 2009, required distributors to pay to the DEP by April 30, 2009 the balances in their special accounts attributable to December 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009, and additional payments on an ongoing basis. Plaintiffs argued that money that accrued in the accounts from December 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009, representing unclaimed refund values, was their property, and that requiring them to pay these funds to the State was an unconstitutional taking. The court agreed. As the 2008 Act did not deprive plaintiffs of ownership of the refund values in the accounts, the retroactive portion of the 2009 Act violated their rights under the U.S. and Connecticut Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were granted summary judgment on liability, and judgment entered in their favor on the count of their complaint seeking a declaratory judgment. Defendants' motion for summary judgment was denied. The parties were ordered to proceed to a hearing to determine the amount of plaintiffs' compensation damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed an appeal against defendant executrix from an order and decree entered by the Court of Probate, District of Berlin (Connecticut). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. She claimed that there was no personal jurisdiction, that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-186 violated the separation of powers provisions of the Connecticut Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant first argued that there was no personal jurisdiction because she had not been properly or timely served and the entire process of service was defective. The court stated that under &sect; 45a-186(b), regardless of whether the executrix had been served at this stage, the court was not deprived of jurisdiction over the appeal because the complaint was served upon the &quot;court of probate that rendered the order.&quot; Next, defendant argued that because the settlement of estates was vested exclusively in probate courts, the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The court stated that although the probate court possessed the sole jurisdiction of final accounts pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-175, the present court had subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal from the probate court. The allowance or disallowance of a probate accounting could be appealed to the present court. Finally, &sect; 45a-186 set forth a procedure for the commencement of probate court appeals. In ruling on a probate appeal, the court was exercising the powers not of a constitutional court of general or common law jurisdiction, but of a probate court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that defendants made statements accusing one of plaintiffs of having intercourse with defendants' young daughter, statements were defamatory per se, and such statements were repeated to any number of persons. In support of their request for a protective order, defendants claimed the much of the information sought was irrelevant, or protected by the rules of practice, the work product doctrine, or privilege. Among other things, the court concluded that the daughter's medical and counseling records were discoverable, as they were likely to make the existence of the defamatory nature of the subject statements more or less probable, and thus, the request was relevant and material. Defendants' conclusory statement that the request was unduly burdensome was insufficient to support their request for a protective order. Plaintiffs' request for documentation from or provided to the Department of Children and Families that related to the law suit was discoverable, as, inter alia, it was likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Since there was no evidence that a forensic report was created in anticipation of litigation, it was also discoverable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Connecticut filed a petition for an order of continued commitment of defendant acquittee to the Connecticut Psychiatric Security Review Board. The acquittee filed motions to dismiss the State's petition, contending, inter alia, that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(c) violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution and that his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity violated his due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acquitee had been found not guilty of kidnapping and other crimes by reason of mental disease or defect and was committed to the custody of the Connecticut Commissioner of Mental Health. He escaped twice, and while in custody exhibited psychotic symptoms, refused to take his medication, and committed several assaults. A psychiatrist opined that he had schizoaffective and personality disorders and that if released, he would stop treatment and taking his medication, thereby presenting a substantial risk of harm to himself or others. The acquittee's psychiatrist opined that his schizoaffective disorder was in remission and that he would not be dangerous if he received treatment. The court found that the acquittee posed an imminent and substantial risk of harm to himself or others if discharged. According to binding precedent, &sect; 17a-593(c) was not facially invalid. Nor had it been disparately applied to the acquittee, as there was no evidence he was treated differently than any other acquittee found to be mentally ill and a danger to himself or others. The court lacked jurisdiction to set aside the judgment on grounds that the acquittee's plea was constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acquittee's motions to dismiss were denied, the State's petition for a continued commitment was granted, and the acquittee was committed to the custody of the Board for a three-year period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmates, who had been convicted of felony murder, robbery, and other crimes 16 years earlier, filed petitions for a writ of habeas corpus, which were opposed by respondent Connecticut Commissioner of Correction. A habeas trial was held.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A store owner was murdered. A witness testified that she heard the victim and the inmates arguing, that she heard a gunshot, and that she then saw the inmates leave the store. She testified at the habeas trial that she had lied during the criminal trial and that she had not been at the crime scene. The court held that as her recantation was not cumulative, and was not available to, and could not have been discovered by, the inmates at the time of their criminal trial, it was newly discovered and was thus cognizable in the habeas case. Her testimony, which the court found credible, was the only thread linking the inmates, who had no cash or guns when they were arrested, to the murder. Moreover, credible evidence was presented at the habeas trial suggesting that the victim's son, who owned a gun that could have fired the fatal bullet, might have been the murderer. While his DNA was not found on the cord used to bind the victim, neither was the inmates' DNA. That the witness lied and kept that to herself for many years did not mean that defense counsel provided deficient performance. Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-470(a), no automatic stay barred the inmates' immediate release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The habeas petitions were granted. The sentences, the verdicts of guilty, the results of the probable cause hearing binding the inmates over for trial, and the warrants ordering their arrest were vacated and the Commissioner was ordered to immediately and unconditionally release them from confinement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff complainant sued defendants, a town, a police department, a chief of police, a police officer, and others, alleging claims for negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, indemnification under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-101a, reckless infliction of emotional distress, violation of due process under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and violation of equal protection under &sect; 1983. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on all counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant alleged that defendants failed to protect her from injuries inflicted by her former husband. All claims other than the due process claim were subject to summary judgment in favor of defendants, based on the complainant's concession or failure to oppose judgment. The only count remaining was the due process claim against the town, the chief, and the officers. In denying summary judgment as to the claims against the town, the court found there were genuine issues of material facts as to whether defendants implicitly but affirmatively encouraged the former husband's domestic violence or enhanced the danger to the complainant because they conveyed to the husband that he could continue to engage in domestic violence with impunity. In addition, there were genuine issues of fact remaining as to whether a reasonable fact finder could have found that the officers' actions were so egregious that they shocked the conscious or whether their conduct constituted a practice endorsed by the town that was so persistent it comprised a custom. A fact finder could find that the officers failed to adequately respond to complaints and to interview, investigate, and arrest the husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion for summary judgment was denied as to the due process claims under &sect; 1983 against the town based on a theory of custom or practice. The motion was granted as to all other claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff church alleged a breach of trust based on the claim that defendant former church members wrongfully failed to relinquish a property after realigning themselves with a different religious organization. The church sought, inter alia, a declaration that the disputed Parish property was held in trust for the Episcopal Church and Diocese. The former members filed special defenses and a counterclaim. The parties moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The history of the relationship between the Parish and the Diocese as to these major property transactions indicated that they were completed with the Parish's recognition and appreciation that authorization first needed to be requested and acquired from the Diocese. The former members informed the bishop that the Parish had affiliated itself with another group. The bishop removed them from their respective position at the Parish and demanded that they relinquish their possession and use of the subject property. They refused. The court found that the parties' dispute could be adjudicated by referencing the local and general church's historical relationship, as well as the polity, constitutions and canons of the Episcopal Church and Diocese without considering substantive issues of religious faith. There was no genuine factual dispute regarding the hierarchal structure of the Episcopal Church. The history between the Parish and the Diocese indicated that the Parish accepted the church's constitutions and canons. The court found that an implied trust in the Parish property existed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the church's joint motion for summary judgment as to the complaint and the former members' counterclaim. The former members' cross motion for summary judgment was denied. The court declared the the real and personal property of the Parish were held in trust for the Diocese of Connecticut and the Episcopal Church, and that the former members were without any right as to the real and personal property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was serving an 80-year sentence for murder. Following a hearing, the inmate was placed into a program called Administrative Segregation. A couple years later, the inmate received a Restrictive Status Notification of Decision, informing the inmate that he was to remain on a status known as Special Needs Management, as a result a hearing, for which he received no notice and did not attend. In support of their motion for summary judgment, defendants argued that there was no viable constitutional claim for lack of due process and that all defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The court noted that the inmate correctly argued that the administrative directive required a hearing prior to placement in Special Needs Management. However, the directive was silent on whether a hearing was required when the inmate went from one restrictive housing status to another. The court concluded that the fact that the inmate did not receive another hearing when going from Administrative Segregation to Special Needs Management did not constitute a due process violation. The court further concluded that qualified immunity served as an additional basis for granting defendants' motion.</SPAN></P>

The underlying action alleged a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) against the insured, arising from a tenant's actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer issued a commercial general liability policy to the insured for the insured's property. Five renewal policies were issued on an annual basis. The insured leased the property to a tenant who operated a pizza and pub on the premises. A nearby home owner (NHO) filed suit against the tenant and the insured, alleging that loud noises and vibrations had negatively impacted the NHO. The claim against the insured sounded in NIED. The insurer represented the insured in the underlying action under a reservation of rights, and it sought declaratory relief with respect to its defense and indemnity obligations. Based on the court's interpretation of the language of the policy and the allegations of the underlying complaint, it found that the insurer only had a duty to defend the insured if the underlying complaint alleged that the NHO's injuries were caused by an &quot;occurrence.&quot; The allegations indicated that the insured was negligent in renting the property to the tenant. The court could not say, as a matter of law, that the complaint failed to allege that the NHO's injuries were caused by an &quot;accident,&quot; and therefore an &quot;occurrence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the owner violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47-10 by failing to record the warranty deed upon which he relied. Thus, between the owner and the BFPs, the unrecorded deed was ineffectual. The land records could be safely relied upon by bona fide purchasers such as the BFPs. The law precluded any recovery by the owner against the BFPs. The BFPs did not make or join the City's motion to strike, and its denial was not binding on them. Further, a &sect; 47-10 violation was not dealt with by the trial court in denying the City's motion. The owner's claim that the constitutional claim raised--that the City took his property by the tax sale without notice to him--superseded &sect; 47-10 was rejected. The claim that the City had actual notice of the owner's interest in the property was irrelevant as to the BFPs because the complaint did not allege notice to them. The issue was not the validity of the BFPs's title, but the owner's right to bring an action to assert his title based upon an unrecorded deed that had no effect as to the BFPs. The owner's claim that the BFPs did not assert facts to establish an equitable estoppel defense was rejected as &sect; 47-10 acted as an estoppel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate's murder conviction was reversed and the case was remanded. Upon reconsideration, the Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The inmate petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus based on an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and alleging ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The habeas court held that inmate did not show ineffective assistance of counsel. Trial counsel's suppression argument was based on the law in Connecticut at the time. Notwithstanding the existence of persuasive authority from other jurisdictions, the claim that the search was unconstitutional as although the father consented to the search, the mother refused to sign the consent form, was a matter of first impression in Connecticut. Trial counsel could not be faulted for failing to raise the constitutional claims concerning the search, and he did not provide deficient performance by failing to make an adequate record of the inmate's mother's refusal to consent to the search. Further, the inmate was not present and objecting to the search, and his mother's position was unclear. Regardless of his mother's position, the search of the inmate's home was lawful as to the inmate as his father had consented. Since the inmate failed to prove his ineffective assistance claim he failed to show cause for the procedural default. The claim was not novel for purposes of providing cause as the claim was available at the time of the default.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a City, and its police chief, an undercover police officer (UO), and six police officers (officers), moved for summary judgment in a suit filed by plaintiff accused alleging negligence, indemnity pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7-465 and 52-557n, malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and a violation of the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 as a result of his improper arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court noted that after two days of conversations with a suspected Internet predator, the officers arranged a sting. Based on the accused's close physical proximity to the UO and his interest in the band whose name she had arranged to wear on her sweatshirt, the UO signalled for assistance. The accused struggled with the assisting officers. There was probable cause for an arrest of the Internet predator, and for the arrest for interfering with that arrest. The force used to subdue and handcuff the accused was not excessive. The officers were entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest, malicious prosecution, and excessive force claims. The intentional infliction of emotional distress claim failed. There was no causal connection between the accused's arrest, conviction, and incarceration and a specific deficiency in the City's policies for police training and supervision. The indemnity claim against the police chief also failed as the accused did not show a policy caused his alleged damages, show that a failure to train amounted to deliberate indifference, or overcome qualified immunity. Since the claims against the officers failed, the derivative claims failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner's property was in a residential zone, and it was subject to a conservation residential development (CRD) that had been approved by the town planning and zoning commission (PZC). He sought a modification of the CRD in order to reconfigure the lot into a two-lot subdivision. The PZC denied the request. Thereafter, the owner obtained a variance from the BZA. It was noted that the BZA failed to describe the hardship upon which the variance was based, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-7. The PZC appealed, and the court initially addressed the question of whether it was aggrieved. It found that the zoning regulations did not contemplate an appeal from an enforcement order of the PZC or a town &quot;board.&quot; Further, the PZC was precluded from appealing unless a ruling of its own was in issue. Accordingly, it lacked authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-3(e) to show that it was statutorily aggrieved pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(a)(1). Further, the authority granted to the PZC under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8-25 and 8-26, and the fact that the BZA granted the variance, did not support classical aggrievement in the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, State of Connecticut, ex rel the State of Connecticut Animal Control Officer (State), filed a petition under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22-329a in which it sought temporary and permanent custody of several animals. By the final day of the hearing, the only animals that remained subject to the hearing were horse one and horse two.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that in six months, horse one had gone from a moderately thin condition to an emaciated condition, and horse two had gone from being basically healthy to being too thin. When the animals were seized, all of the stalls were filthy, with large amounts of feces, urine, and generally wet conditions. The horses had no food and no water. One feed bucket contained feces. Neglect under &sect; 22-329a included the failure to provide necessary sustenance, proper care, and wholesome air, food, and water under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-247(a). Horse two and horse one were neglected. The owner's claim that he did not have possession of the horses was rejected as the owner was not technically a defendant. Under &sect; 22-329a, an animal was either neglected or not, regardless of who had ownership or custody of the animal. Further, the court noted that the owner had an intimate knowledge of the horses' conditions, and failed to place them in a better environment. Under &sect; 22-329a, animals who were neglected or cruelly treated had to be taken from their owners, and there was no provision for an owner to retain ownership if he proved an intent to treat the animal better in the future.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Permanent custody of horse one and horse two was vested in the Connecticut Department of Agriculture and the owner was ordered to pay the State for its expenses incurred in caring for the horses at a rate of $ 25 per day per animal and all veterinary costs and expenses incurred for the welfare of the horses to the date permanent custody vested in the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex parte motion seeking an order of temporary custody in the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF) and the immediate emergency commitment to DCF of petitioner, a child two days shy of his 18th birthday, were denied. The child filed a neglect and uncared for petition under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-129(a). DCF intervened and moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that since the child had reached the age of 18, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his petition to have himself adjudicated neglected and/or uncared for and committed to DCF. Jurisdiction for the commitment of a child or youth was statutorily limited to youth aged 17 or younger. The limitation on the court's statutory authority to enter dispositions of commitment only for children or youth who were under 18 was consistent with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-1d, w which provided that any person 18 years old or older was an adult for all purposes. Connecticut law did not grant the courts any authority to issue a retroactive commitment on behalf of an adult, or order an adult committed if the petition was filed before the adult attained the age of 18. That would be subjecting an adult to the guardianship of DCF, which was untenable proposition, and was the reason the law stated that youth committed before they turn 18 only remained committed up to the age of 21 if they consented to DCF's discretionary provision of services. The child's claim was moot. The requirements of the evading review exception to the mootness doctrine were not met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was granted. The motion to dismiss the child's neglect and uncared for petition was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of, inter alia, sexual assault and kidnapping. Following appeals, the case was remanded with direction to reverse the judgment with respect to the kidnapping conviction. The matter was scheduled for resentencing. Defendant filed a memorandum opposing the State's resentencing of defendant on all counts under the &quot;aggregate package&quot; theory of sentencing. Defendant also filed a motion to disqualify judicial authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that, under the remand order, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to resentence him on the sexual assault convictions. The court found, however, that defendant, in appealing, voluntarily called into play the validity of the entire sentencing package. The original sentencing court had imposed individual sentences merely as component parts or building blocks of a larger total punishment for the aggregate convictions. The remand order did not explicitly address resentencing at all, and the court had to deviate from its express terms because the State opted for a conviction of unlawful restraint. The court was thus required to sentence defendant on the class A misdemeanor. Defendant's reliance on the specific language of the remand order which stated that the trial court's judgment was to be affirmed in all other respects was misplaced. The trial court did not lose jurisdiction to resentence on surviving counts when a reversal on appeal disrupted sentencing package and original intent. The original intent in this case was to impose a total effective sentence of 40 years to serve. Defendant's claim of prosecutorial misconduct and vindictiveness was without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's objection to resentencing and his motion to disqualify judicial authority were denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hartford Probate Court (Connecticut) issued a decree finding that it was in the best interest of a conserved party (CP) to remove a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) directive, discontinue dialysis, and remove all medications save those necessary for his comfort. Appellants, the CP's relatives and a family pastor, filed an appeal and a motion to stay the execution of the decree, which the CP's co-conservators and attorney opposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CP was in a motorcycle accident and sustained a brain injury. His attending physician testified that he was in a persistent vegetative state and lacked higher brain function, that several major organs had failed, and that performing CPR on him would likely result in a gruesome death. The appellate court rejected appellants' claim that the probate court abused its discretion by ignoring their application to act as conservators, as it was not supported by any evidence in the record. Their claim that they were denied due process because the notice of the hearing was unconstitutionally vague and they were denied access to the CP's medical records was not supported by the evidence. Therefore, they failed to show that they were likely to prevail on the merits of their appeal. They offered no medical or other evidence of irreparable harm to themselves. Under all the circumstances, the balance of equities weighed in favor of allowing the CP a comfortable and dignified passing. And as appellants presented no evidence that the probate court acted improperly or unfairly, granting a stay under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-186(f) was not appropriate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After their request for a parking lot permit was denied, plaintiff property owners sued defendants, a town and a first selectman, alleging substantive and procedural due process violations under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, violations of the equal protection and takings clauses under the federal and state constitutions, and a taking through inverse condemnation. The owners sought mandamus and declaratory relief. Defendants moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners wanted to use their undeveloped lot as a parking lot where members of the public could park for a fee. The owners asserted that the zoning regulations did not prohibit privately owned public use parking lots, but that such lots were regulated by an ordinance that allowed for parking lots that met certain requirements, which the owners alleged their lot met. Among other things, the court concluded that the owners' due process claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 failed, as the owners did not have a &quot;clear entitlement&quot; to a permit; the subject town ordinance provided that the permitting process did not apply to new parking lots that did not conform with zoning regulations. The proposed lot would not conform with the zoning regulation which prohibited new, privately owned public parking lots. The owners' equal protection claims also failed, as the owners were not similarly situated to the other land owners operating parking lots in the town, who ran exiting parking lots. The owners' inverse condemnation claim survived, however, as there existed issues of material fact as to what uses the owners might have for the land other than using it as a for profit public parking lot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion for summary judgment was denied as to the inverse condemnation claim and granted as to all other claims.</SPAN></P>

The applicant appealed the denial and filed a motion to supplement the record, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(k), claiming supplementation was necessary to avoid any confusion in terminology. Intervening defendants, the applicant's neighbors, opposed the motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant argued that &quot;confusing and obfuscatory&quot; testimony was presented by the attorney representing the neighbors. Thus, the commission became confused by the terms &quot;access strip,&quot; &quot;driveway,&quot; and &quot;private road,&quot; which led to a misapplication of the regulations. The applicant claimed the three maps offered to supplement the record were subdivision maps approved prior to the adoption of the subdivision regulation. The applicant contended the maps would illustrate the intention, ambit, and meaning of the regulation. The applicant's appeal was grounded on the assertion that the commission misinterpreted and misapplied its own regulation. The motion court was asked to decide the issue raised without benefit of trial briefs. The motion court only had a one-and-a-half page conclusory memorandum by the applicant, no responsive brief by the applicant's neighbors, the transcript from the motion hearing, and a one-page observation from the commission's lawyer. The parties were entitled to argue the issue of supplementation in their trial briefs before the hearing judge, who could reject the materials upon a finding of lack of ambiguity in the regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court did not act on the motion and left the decision to whom the appeal was assigned for a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord filed a summary process action seeking to recover possession of a premises from defendants, including a tenant, for nonpayment of rent. The tenant filed a third-party complaint against the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families. The Commissioner moved to dismiss the third-party complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the tenant requested that the Commissioner be required to resume rental payments to the landlord retroactive to the date of their termination. The relief requested an enforceable monetary award that Connecticut's courts had refused to award absent explicit statutory authority. Since the tenant sought prospective and retroactive rental payments, the relief sought was not truly prospective. The rental payments were to be paid from state funds and measured as a monetary loss resulting from a past breach of a legal duty by a state official, despite the tenant's attempt to cast her claim as a claim for injunctive relief. The tenant sought monetary damages against the State, and was required to comply with the procedures for bringing such a claim. The claim fell within the jurisdiction of the Connecticut Claims Commissioner as a claim against the State, and did not fall within one of the five exceptions listed in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-142 that would remove it from the Claims Commissioner's jurisdiction. As the tenant failed to allege that she received permission from the Claims Commissioner to file her claim, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff public assistance recipient filed an action against defendant commissioner of the state department of social services, seeking to enjoin the state from termination state funded medical benefits to the recipient and all members of a proposed class. The recipient filed a motion for class certification pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect;&sect; 9-7 and 9-8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed class of plaintiffs consisted of impoverished legal immigrants with significant medical needs, residing in Connecticut under five years, and who were terminated from the State Medical Assistance for Noncitizens program. The recipient claimed that 2009 Conn. Acts 05 (Spec. Sess.) violated the proposed class members' right to equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. Among other things, the court concluded that the recipient's claims were not barred by sovereign immunity. Next, the court concluded that the proposed class met the requirements for certification. Since the members of the proposed class, which was made up of impoverished, often disabled and elderly, and those new to Connecticut, were unlikely to join in the suit or institute individual suits, the numerous requirement was satisfied. The court also found the questions presented to be common to all the proposed class members, arose from the same course of events, the passage of the subject legislation, and common issues predominated. As for the merits of the claims, the court concluded that 2009 Conn. Acts 55 and 64 (Spec. Sess.) violated the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The recipient's motion for class certification was granted as to all legal non-citizens who were among those who had their benefits terminated. The court found in favor of plaintiffs and permanently enjoined the commissioner from enforcing 2009 Conn. Acts 06, &sect;&sect; 55 and 64 (Spec. Sess.).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee made a speech which resulted in her discipline and termination from employment. She filed suit, and the jury awarded damages to her. The town sought post-verdict relief. The employee sought attorneys fees, punitive damages, and offer of judgment interest, which was granted by the court. In deciding the motion for post-verdict relief, the court noted that the jury's responses to interrogatories accompanying the general verdict were not inconsistent. Although they concluded that the town reasonably believed that the employee's speech substantially or materially interfered with her bona fide job performance, it also found that the employer's claim in that regard was pretextual or unworthy of belief, and that the termination was based on retaliation for the speech. There was no basis to overturn the verdict with respect to &sect; 31-51q. A letter written by the employee, accusing the town first selectman of deliberately acting dishonestly in connection with a fire that destroyed the old town hall, which was a matter of public significance, supported the claim under &sect; 31-51m. There were no errors in evidentiary rulings or jury instructions that necessitated a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set forth its judgment with regard to the civil action commenced by plaintiff inmate, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as monetary damages against defendants, the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Corrections, a warden, and others. The suit challenged a rule of defendants that required outgoing mail from inmates to be marked with a stamp indicating that the correspondence originated from an inmate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with defendants that plaintiff's claims seeking monetary damages were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Further, plaintiff presented no evidence that he received permission from the office of the claims commissioner to bring his claims for money damages against defendants. Therefore, the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred those claims. However, plaintiff's claims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief were not barred by sovereign immunity. The court held that the requirement regarding the stamp at issue was not a regulation but was merely a directive adopted pursuant to the Commissioner's statutory and regulatory authority. Accordingly, the requirements for valid regulation making set forth under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-168, did not apply. The court also found the directive requiring the stamp was a security procedure and, therefore, exempt from the requirements of &sect; 4-168 and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-78a(a)(1). The court also held that to the extent that the stamp requirement impinged upon plaintiff's right to anonymous communication, the requirement was nevertheless valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed plaintiff's claims for monetary damages because sovereign immunity barred such claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother claimed that defendants' demand for a trial de novo was untimely because it was filed prior to the date the clerk's office deposited notice of the arbitrator's decision in the mail.

Defendants pointed out that the mother was in no way prejudiced or misled by the early filing of the demand and that sustaining the mother's objection to the demand would have deprived defendants their fundamental right to a jury trial. The court found that, as presently constituted, the language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-549z(d) was unambiguous.

The commissioner moved to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that sovereign immunity did not bar the counts alleging intentional torts. Neither Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 19a-24 nor 20-13j created a private cause of action. The single publication rule was adopted with respect to Internet postings. Defamatory statements posted on the Internet were considered published on the date they were initially posted. As more than two years lapsed between the original publication date and the date this action began, the libel claims based on the October 10, 2006, publication were time-barred. The continuing course of conduct doctrine did not apply. The failure to remove the settlement agreement from the physician's profile was not later wrongful conduct. The claim was not time-barred insofar as it concerned the republication of the allegedly libelous information. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584 did not apply to the negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress counts as they were actually libel counts. The &sect; 1983 count failed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner sued a town, challenging the valuation placed upon its property by the town's assessor. In count 11 of the complaint, the owner sought a reduction in the assessed value based on an order issued by the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection to clean up contamination on the property. Both parties sought summary judgment on this count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner did not cause the pollution on the property, but it was of the contamination at the time it acquired title. The assessor rejected the owner's request for a reduction in the property's assessed value based on Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-63e, which barred a reduction in the assessed value of polluted property if the owner acquired such property after any notice of the existence of such condition was filed on the land records. The owner argued that &sect; 12-63e, as applied to itself, violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court disagreed. Section 12-63e  deprived only two categories of landowners of a reduction in assessment value: those who caused the contamination and those who took title knowing the property had been previously contaminated. There was a rational basis for the classification: the desire to treat a landowner who did not cause the contamination, but who took title with knowledge of it, the same as the one who caused the contamination while owning the property. As the owner raised the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 12-63e for the first time in the instant case, that claim was not barred by collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As to count 11, the town's motion for summary judgment was granted and the owner's motion for summary judgment was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an indigent prisoner, who was a former litigant in two appellate court cases, filed suit against defendant assistant appellate court clerk, claiming that the clerk's actions denied him access to the court and that he was damaged as a result of the clerk's actions. The clerk filed a motion to dismiss, claiming sovereign immunity and statutory immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed handwritten pleadings in two separate appellate matters. In each case, the clerk notified plaintiff that handwritten pleadings were not accepted without the appellate court's permission. Both appellate cases were dismissed. Plaintiff's action was brought against the clerk in her official capacity. As such, sovereign immunity applied. The clerk was a State official and plaintiff's suit concerned a matter in which the clerk represented the State. Nowhere in the complaint did plaintiff allege that he was suing the clerk in her individual capacity. Nevertheless, even if plaintiff's claims were brought against the clerk in her individual capacity, then the clerk was entitled to statutory immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 because there were no allegations that the clerk's actions informing plaintiff that the handwritten pleadings were not accepted were motivated by personal animus, bias based on plaintiff's status as an indigent prisoner, racial bias, or other improper motivation that had nothing to do with the ambit of the clerk's responsibilities. Absolute judicial immunity did not automatically apply to the clerk merely because of her status as such.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Berlin Probate Court (Connecticut) approved a final accounting of the conservator of the person and estate of a decedent. Appellant daughter of the decedent sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter claimed that the probate court's decision regarding the final accounting was arbitrary and challenged the appointment of the conservator in the first place. The appellate court found that the law governing fees for fiduciaries in probate courts was that the fee was to be reasonable. The law did not require the type of precision that the daughter claimed was warranted in reviewing and determining the reasonable fee for a conservator. The probate court undertook a careful review of the submissions and disallowed by more than 25 percent the requested fee of the fiduciary. The finding of the probate court was based on the law and the evidence before it and did not run afoul of any the standards in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-186b. The probate court's determination to credit the conservator's evidence that the payments for managing the care and finances of the decedent were reasonable expenses that were paid for the ward's benefit was not one that could have been overturned. The daughter failed to show that the probate court committed any error described in the criteria in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-186b.</SPAN></P>

The trustee and resident alleged in count one of their complaint that the association failed to follow the procedural provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-190 in amending its charter. Count two alleged violations of equal protection under the state and federal constitutions. The court found, inter alia, that the resident lacked standing as it pertained to count one of the complaint as he did not have a personal and specific interest in the charter amendment process. However, the allegations made in count two were sufficient to demonstrate a realistic possibility of injury to both the resident's and the trustee's voting interests. They both had a specific personal and legal interest in their franchise rights that the associations' actions allegedly affected injuriously. The allegations made in count two were sufficient to demonstrate that the resident and the trustee had standing to pursue an adjudication of the issues on equal protection grounds. The existence of material issues of fact regarding the constitutional issue required a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; &sect; 21-28, and seeking a refund of licensing fees and a permanent injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DCP required plaintiff to obtain itinerant vendor licenses for each of its 41 locations. Plaintiff paid the licensing fees under protect and filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not an itinerant vendor for purposes of Conn. Gen. Stat.s &sect; 21-28 or, alternatively, that it needed only one license. It argued that it was not an itinerant vendor because it was a registered Connecticut corporation with a permanent place of business, and its business was not itinerant. The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-27's definition of &quot;itinerant vendor&quot; did not exclude registered Connecticut corporations. Section 21-27 applied to vendors like plaintiff that sold goods in a tents that were not open for usual business hours for at least a nine-month period each year. However, under &sect; 21-28(a), plaintiff was not required to obtain separate licenses for each of its locations; it needed to obtain only one license that listed each location it intended to sell consumer pyrotechnics. That single license had be posted at each of the temporary locations. Finally, plaintiff's claim for a refund of the licensing fees it paid to the DCP was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a property owner who built a stone retaining wall, appealed the decision of defendant, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), finding that the owner violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-361 and ordered the owner to submit a plan for removal of the wall. The owner claimed that there was a lack of substantial evidence to support the decision and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-359(c) was unconstitutionality vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DEP claimed that the stone retaining wall built by the owner violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-361 because it was waterward of the high tide line (HTL) in tidal, coastal, and navigable waters of the State without a certificate or permit from DEP. The owner claimed his wall was constructed well landward of the HTL. The new wall as built proceeded on a straight line from the old wall without any setback. There was substantial evidence that water came in contact with almost the entire wall on a regular basis and no persuasive evidence that it did not. The methodology used by the DEP to determine the HTL was consistent with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-359(c). The court found that &sect; 22a-359(c) was constitutional and not void for vagueness. A person of ordinary intelligence would have understood that the statute required the DEP to assess the owner's property to determine DEP jurisdiction by looking to physical evidence, tidal gauges, or by any other suitable means. The statute gave fair notice to the owner. Additionally, the evidence collected by the DEP and found in the record established that &sect; 22a-359(c) was implemented without standardless law enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The nurse admitted that the promissory estoppel,  misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, negligent infliction of emotional distress and libel counts were barred by sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that &sect; 46a-104 did not expressly allow for a plaintiff to seek punitive damages. The State was presumed to be immune unless a statute clearly provided that it was not immune. The Connecticut legislature had allowed a plaintiff to obtain attorneys fees, but not punitive damages. The State had not waived its sovereign immunity for punitive damages under the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-248a was interpreted to permit any state employee to have an enforcement action by bringing suit in the trial court. The CFMLA claim alleged retaliation. While Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-51pp banned retaliation, there was no similar clause in &sect; 5-248a. The nurse was deemed to have alleged a &sect; 31-51pp claim. The legislature failed to waive the State's sovereign immunity in &sect; 31-51pp, and intentionally excluded the State as a covered employer in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-51kk. Further, the only enforcement mechanism provided for in the CFMLA was an administrative review process, and the nurse did not allege that she had filed such a complaint. The legislature had not waived the State's sovereign immunity with respect to the CFMLA.</SPAN></P>

Nothing in the lease agreement created an agency relationship between the second lessor and defendant lessee. The complaint contained no allegations that would bring the first lessor within the reach of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-321 as a subrogee of the insured. In addition, the first lessor did not allege that the second lessor was negligent. Nothing in the complaint brought the first lessor's claim under any of the exceptions in &sect; 30106.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff abutting landowners appealed the decisions from defendant zoning board of appeals (board) that denied the landowners' appeals from the actions of a zoning enforcement officer (ZEO) in approving defendant property owner's zoning application and in renewing the owner's expired zoning permit. The board found that the landowners' first appeal was untimely and the renewal was based on the same zoning permit that was continued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners bought a nonconforming lot. The real estate agent in the sale was also a board member. The agent also sold the adjoining lot to the owner. The landowners had expressed interest in buying the adjoining lot. The landowners argued that the board member had a conflict of interest under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-11 and their first appeal was timely under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-7. There was no evidence that the board member had a financial interest in the matter acted upon by the board and the member made every effort not to participate in the proceedings. The board's decision to deny the landowners' appeal of the issuance of a zoning permit as untimely was improper because the landowners' knowledge that a house was being built on the adjoining lot constituted constructive knowledge that a zoning permit had been issued. The date that the landowners' contacted the zoning office about the alleged zoning error was less than the 30-day limitation imposed by &sect; 8-7. The renewal of the expired zoning permit was proper under &sect; 8-7 because the statute stayed all proceedings and maintained the status quo until the landowners' issue on appeal had been resolved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board's decision to deny the landowners' appeal as untimely was reversed and remanded to the board for a decision on the appeal from the issuance of the zoning permit as originally filed. On remand, the board was to consider the validity of the permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney obtained all relevant reports and reviewed the substance of the State's allegations with her client and conducted an investigation, including consulting with an investigator. The attorney went to the location of the initial police stop and personally investigated the circumstances of the environment of the alleged crimes. The court found that the attorney developed a defense strategy, which included a claim or argument that the prisoner was a drug user and the 38 bags of rock cocaine undoubtedly found on his possession were for the purpose of personal use and not for the purpose of sale. In addition, the court found that the attorney perceived of a number of legal issues stemming from the search of the prisoner. Not calling the prisoner was a tactical decision by the attorney and the court found an insufficient basis to grant habeas relief on that basis. The court accredited the testimony of the attorney that she reviewed procedure as set out in Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 54-94(a), which provided for a conditional plea of nolo contendere. The court found that the prisoner made a knowing election to not pursue a nolo plea and to proceed to a trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted petitioner inmate of sexual assault in the third degree under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-72a(a)(1)(A), and unlawful restraint in the second degree under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-96. The court sentenced the inmate to a total effective sentence of five years to serve, suspended after 18 months, with 10 years of probation and the inmate had to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. The inmate petitioned for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that he was entitled to a new trial because the State failed to disclose exculpatory evidence that one of the State's witnesses was promised that the State would support his request for a sentence modification if he testified against the inmate. The inmate claimed that he could have used the information to impeach the witness' credibility by showing he had an incentive to implicate the inmate and assist the State. While the court found no evidence of a formal agreement, the evidence suggested that the State did make such a suggestion to the witness and that, despite the defense's explicit request for disclosure of such information, the State provided none to the inmate. The court further concluded that the withheld impeachment material was of particular importance. The State presented testimony from three eyewitnesses, the complaining witness, her cousin, and the subject witness. Because the cousin's testimony did not support the complaining witness' version of events, the testimony of the subject witness, a friend of the inmate who supposedly had nothing to gain, which corroborated the complaining witness and contradicted the cousin likely influenced the outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the parents and the students, filed an action against defendant Board of Education, seeking to enjoin a school board's policy of using drug-sniffing dogs to conduct warrantless, suspicionless sweeps of school property or, in the alternative, a court order requiring school officials to provide parents no less than 48 hours notice prior to conduct any future searches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board and superintendant ordered police officers to conduct a sweep of cars and unattended lockers at the high school and middle school using dogs. The sweeps were permitted under Canton, Conn., Regs. of the Board of Education &sect; 5145.122(a)(5). At trial, plaintiffs' only witness, a parent, testified that she did not believe that using drug-sniffing dogs was an effective way to protect the safety of students and was harmful to them and that conducting such sweeps without notifying parents interfered with the parents' fundamental right to control the upbringing of their children. The court concluded that plaintiffs failed to establish success on the merits of their claims. Among other things, the court held that a dog-sniff search of a car or unattended locker was not a &quot;search&quot; for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. In addition, the Board's police requiring students to &quot;stay put&quot; during the search did not effect a &quot;seizure,&quot; as it did not exceed the discretion vested in the school officials to schedule student activities during the day. The court further concluded that the sweeps did not intrude in any meaningful way in the core relationship between parent and student.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover detective engaged in two freebase cocaine purchases with the prisoner. The court held there was a strong presumption of adequacy as to any previous attorney and there was simply no evidence to conclude deficient performance. The court tacitly found that counsel explored and discussed with the prisoner what witnesses might bolster the alibi defense. Counsel employed investigators, talked with witnesses, explored the alibi, with no success. In fact, the court noted that one of the witnesses consulted by the attorneys actually corroborated the presence of the prisoner in the bar on at least one of the dates in question. There was no reason to persuade the court to conclude that the prisoner did not have full opportunity to litigate any claimed ineffective assistance of counsel against counsel in his prior petition. There was no indication of deficient performance on the part of counsel for failing to seek a judgment of acquittal on the two underlying sale charges. The court found no sufficient proof to persuade the court that there was some deprivation of constitutional dimension on a stand-alone basis, let alone ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner applied for a temporary injunction prohibiting further proceedings in two cases, a summary process action involving defendant, a landowner of record, and an appeal of municipal tax assessments involving defendants, a city, a city assessor, and a city board of tax appeals (city). Plaintiff also sought a declaratory judgment determining the rights of the parties in property sold at a tax sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a municipal tax assessment on the property in 2000, which was settled by entry of a stipulated judgment. The city assessed the property at a higher value in 2003, and plaintiff filed a second tax appeal in 2004. Thereafter, plaintiff failed to pay the assessed taxes on the property in the years 2004 to 2008. The city auctioned off the property pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-157. Plaintiff did not redeem the property, and a deed to the property was given to the landowner of record. Plaintiff claimed that &sect; 12-157 was unconstitutional. The court found that plaintiff was not likely to succeed on the merits because legislatively enacted statutes were presumed to be constitutional and plaintiff did not offer any citation to authority in support of his argument that &sect; 12-157 was unconstitutional. Moreover, an appellate court had already ruled that &sect; 12-157 was constitutional. Plaintiff would not have been irreparably harmed because it was plaintiff's dilatory actions that resulted in the tax appeal case not being resolved. On the other hand, the landowner of record would have suffered some harm if he was enjoined from proceeding with his summary process action.</SPAN></P>

The State filed a motion to transfer the case from the youthful offender docket to the regular criminal docket pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-76c.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that &sect; 54-76c gave prosecutors unbridled discretion to make the transfer at issue. The State also argued that defendant did not enjoy a vested liberty interest because &sect; 54-76c denied youthful offender status ab initio, precluding such rights from vesting. The court found that, due to the benefits bestowed on eligible defendants in receiving youthful offender status under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 54-76h, 54-76k, 54-76l, 54-76o, and in view of the relevant precedent holding that such privileges constituted a cognizable liberty interest, the statutory benefits afforded to defendant in this case constituted a liberty interest in youthful offender status for purposes of due process analysis. Original jurisdiction over defendant rested on the youthful offender docket and defendant was not automatically precluded from youthful offender status by virtue of an automatic transfer provision. Therefore, the liberty interests enjoyed by defendant in youthful offender status had vested. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-76c provided the court with discretion to determine whether defendant should have been transferred from the youthful offender docket to the regular criminal docket.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's motion to transfer defendant from the youthful offender docket to the regular criminal docket of the superior court was continued until such time as the court could have conducted a hearing to determine the appropriateness of that transfer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sued defendants, the Connecticut Commissioner of Correction and a phone company, alleging violations of  Conn.

He sought injunctive relief and a writ of mandamus preventing  defendants from charging him allegedly excessive rates. Defendants moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that defendants failed to implement a statutorily required debit card telephone system in lieu of a collect call telephone system in the prison and that he was injured as a result. The court held that as plaintiff's claims against the Commissioner were based solely on her alleged actions or inactions in her official capacity, and as the State had not waived sovereign immunity for this matter, plaintiff's claims against her were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Plaintiff's  claims under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1, based on an exclusive contract between the State and the company, were barred as to both defendants by the state action doctrine. Plaintiff's claims against defendants alleging violations of &sect; 18-81s; his claim under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), which was based on an alleged violation of &sect; 18-81s; and his claim alleging a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, were moot, because the debit card system provided for in &sect; 18-81s was established and he could access it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a request for a writ of habeas corpus, wherein he challenged the legality of his detention. The inmate had been previously convicted of kidnapping in the first degree and sexual assault in the first degree, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-92(a)(2)(A) and 53a-70(a)(1). Consecutive terms of imprisonment, with a mandatory minimum, were imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Charges against the inmate arose from his chasing a female victim in a parking lot and forcing her to engage in sexual conduct with him. The inmate was convicted and sentenced, and that decision was affirmed on appeal. Thereafter, the inmate filed his habeas corpus action, alleging claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, errors by the trial judge, cumulative errors, and actual innocence. The court found no violations of U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 by the multiple alleged instances of counsel's ineffectiveness. Counsel's questioning of witnesses, trial investigation, and evidentiary determinations were not deficient. Moreover, any such instances, combined with alleged trial court errors, did not suffice to constitute a ground for a new trial. The court also found that as trial court error and cumulative errors were not previously raised and the inmate failed to assert any cause or prejudice that cured the default, he was procedurally defaulted from raising those claims in the habeas corpus matter. As there was no newly discovered evidence to support the claim of actual innocence, it failed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CEO moved to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The patient was acquitted by reason of mental disease or defect in a criminal case and was confined at the hospital under the psychiatric security review board's jurisdiction. He sought to preclude the introduction of his treatment records in a second application for discharge. The trial court rejected the patient's claim that the adequacy of his allegations had to be addressed in a motion to strike as controlling precedent held that specific pleading requirements had been imposed on actions in which a plaintiff sought declaratory or injunctive relief on the basis of allegations that a state official engaged in wrongful conduct in excess of the officer's statutory authority. The patient had to do more that allege that the CEO's conduct was in excess of her statutory authority; he had to allege or otherwise show facts that reasonably supported those allegations. The complaint did not allege that the CEO engaged in any conduct at all. The patient failed to show that the exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied. The trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action.</SPAN></P>

The inmate thereafter sought habeas corpus relief, alleging that his counsel misadvised him as to his parole eligibility. The inmate alleged that there was no discussion regarding parole eligibility in counsel's advice that led to the decision to accept the plea. The court found that the plea canvass was flawless, that the sentence agreed to in the plea agreement was imposed, and that other charges against the inmate were nolled. Accordingly, there was no basis to set the guilty plea aside, and no finding of ineffectiveness of counsel. Although the court noted that the better practice was for counsel to provide information to an inmate regarding parole eligibility, there was no requirement in that regard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor sued defendant property owners for payment on a bond that was substituted for a mechanic's lien. The contractor also requested an award for costs incurred in a prior action involving the owners' efforts to discharge, reduce, or dissolve the mechanic's lien upon the substitution of a bond. The owners counterclaimed for violation of the Connecticut Home Improvement Contractors Act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a previous action between the parties the owners applied for the discharge of a mechanic's lien which the contractor had placed on the subject premises. While an appeal was pending, the trial court granted an application by the owners to substitute a bond for the mechanic's lien and the lien was dissolved. The court found that the subject property was a commercial property and not a residential property. Therefore, the contractor's work on the property was not a home improvement pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-419(4) and the Connecticut Home Improvement Contractors Act and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act were not applicable. In addition, the court found that the contractor proved, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that he was entitled to payment for the goods and services he claimed at trial. Further, the contractor timely filed his lien as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-34. Furthermore, the court declined to find that the revised mechanic's lien statute was unconstitutional. Finally, the mechanic's lien interest was created when the very first services were rendered and/or materials delivered pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-33(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment for the contractor on the counterclaims by the owners, entered judgment for the contractor on the bond claim and awarded the contractor the amount on the bond, interest, and costs including attorneys fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee filed claim sought to recover cash proceeds and dividends that escheated to the state in the name of the trustor. The treasurer denied the claim because the property sought was not trust property, but rather had belonged to the trustor and that sovereign immunity barred litigants from recovering funds from the state on behalf of third parties. The court found, inter alia, that the trustee did not assert that he obtained authorization to sue from the claims commissioner or that the legislature had waived sovereign immunity. Because his action, as a matter of law, had to be construed as a claim for money damages, it was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The trustee failed to demonstrate that the treasurer acted pursuant to an unconstitutional statute or exceeded her statutory duties under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 3-70a. The probate court's decree did not order the treasurer to return the trustor's escheated property. It merely empowered the trustee to file a claim for the trust's assets, on the assumption that the property escheated to the state was in fact trust assets. Therefore, the trustee was not entitled to mandamus relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State made three settlement offers prior to trial, which were rejected by the inmate upon his election to proceed to trial on the merits.

The inmate filed his habeas corpus action, wherein he alleged that his counsel was ineffective for not insisting that the inmate accept each of the State's pretrial offers. The court noted that the inmate sought specific enforcement of the third offer. The court found that the inmate failed to meet the Strickland standard. The rejections of the plea bargain offers were the decision of the inmate after effective representation and advice by his counsel. There was no prejudice to the inmate by the rejection thereof, as he went to trial and there was no unfairness shown therein. The fact that the decision to go to trial rather than accept one of the plea offers was a bad one did not support a finding that the inmate's counsel was in any way deficient in his performance.</SPAN></P>

While the mother complied with some of the specific steps ordered, she missed individual counseling sessions, appointments for substance abuse screening, and parenting classes, and did not benefit from the services she attended.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver filed suit against defendants, a lessee and lessors. The lessors moved to strike the counts alleging that they were negligent in failing to investigate the lessee's insurance coverage, failing to require the lessee to provide insurance coverage in violation of the lease, leasing a vehicle without proper insurance coverage in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a, and failing to meet the requirements of &sect; 14-154a(b)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver alleged that he struck the lessee's stopped vehicle, which caused him to lose control of his vehicle and crash into a center barrier. The lessee rented the vehicle he was driving from the lessors. The superior court held that no causal connection was alleged between the accident and the lessors' negligence and none could be inferred from the allegations of the complaint. Because &sect; 14-154a(b) did not fit the description of laws exempt from preemption, it was preempted by the Federal Public Transportation Equity Act of 2005, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106. Section 30106(b)(2) exempted from preemption state laws imposing liability on businesses in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles that failed to meet financial responsibility or liability insurance requirements. Section 14-154a(b) was not a law imposing liability on any entity for failure to meet the requirements of state law. It provided lessors the option to avoid vicarious liability by having the leased vehicle insured in a certain amount. The statute also did not compel liability insurance in any amount. Therefore, it contained no liability insurance requirements under State law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient filed a medical malpractice action against defendants, a doctor, a medical practice, and a hospital. She filed an offer of judgment. Defendants objected, arguing that the patient's offer did not comply with Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 17-14A. The patient replied, arguing that under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192b, she was not required to comply with &sect; 17-14A because her cause of action accrued before October 1, 2005.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a had been held to be procedural, &sect; 17-14A governed and took precedence over &sect; 52-192b and that the patient had to comply with &sect; 17-14A because the Practice Book did not contain the explicit date restriction of &sect; 52-192b. They argued that the Practice Book rules and the statutes conflicted. The superior court held that the patient's offer of judgment was appropriate. Section 52-192b specified that actions accruing prior to October 1, 2005 were controlled by the applicable statutes in effect as of January 1, 2005. The patient's cause of action accrued before October 1, 2005. Therefore, under &sect; 52-192b, she was not required to comply with &sect; 52-192a(b), which was identical to &sect; 17-14A. The Practice Book and the statutes did not conflict. The superior court had to presume that the judiciary intended the procedural rules to be consistent with the statutes and discharge its responsibility to ensure that the Practice Book rules and the statutes remained harmonious. Even though the Practice Book did not specifically mention offers of judgment, a party was not precluded from using the statutory process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities and a relator, filed a housing discrimination action against defendant landlords under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-64c, which made it illegal to discriminate against a person based on a lawful source of income. Plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and punitive damages or a civil penalty under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 46a-86(c) and 46a-89(b)(2). The court held a trial on the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The relator went to look for an apartment and was told that she would need a security deposit. She indicated that she had a security deposit guarantee and handed the paperwork to one of defendants, who stated that he would accept it. When she came to move in, however, she was told that she would not be allowed to do so unless the security deposit was in cash. The court stated that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it did not state that a security deposit guarantee was a legal source of income. Furthermore, a security deposit guarantee was a source of income, defined by a dictionary as a gain or recurrent benefit. The court held that plaintiffs had established a prima facie case of discrimination, which defendants had not rebutted. They did not dispute that they rejected the relator because she had a security deposit guarantee. Their claim of ignorance of the law was not a defense. Furthermore, although defendants claimed that they were of the same social status and race as the relator, it was not a defense to say that one did not dislike members of a protected group.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendants had violated &sect; 46a-64c. It stated that it would make orders regarding damages following further evidence by the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accident victim sued defendants, the automobile driver and the leasing companies, for personal injuries. The victim alleged negligence and recklessness claims against the driver and negligence and vicarious liability claims against the leasing companies. The leasing companies filed a motion to strike the claims against the leasing companies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident victim alleged that he was injured in an automobile accident with the driver, who was operating a vehicle leased from the leasing companies. The victim further alleged that the leasing companies were negligent in leasing the vehicle without ensuring proper insurance coverage in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a and thereby were vicariously liable under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a(a). The leasing companies contended that the claims against them were barred by a provision of the Federal Public Transportation Equity Act of 2005, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106, referred to as the Graves Amendment. The court found that because no causal connection was alleged between the accident and the leasing companies' alleged negligence and none was to be inferred from the allegations of the negligence claim, the negligence claim was to be stricken. In addition, because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a(b) did not fit the description of laws exempt from preemption, it was preempted by the Graves Amendment. Thus, the leasing companies were not vicariously liable. Finally, the Graves Amendment was constitutional as it was within the commerce powers granted to Congress pursuant to U.S. Const. art. I.</SPAN></P>
