</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs appealed a decision of the District Court of the Seventh Judicial District, Bonneville County (Idaho), granting summary judgment in favor defendant government in an action alleging that the Petroleum Clean Water Trust Fund Act, Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 41-4908 - 4909 (1990), was an unconstitutional and improper exercise of the legislature's authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed the Petroleum Clean Water Trust Fund Act (the Act), Idaho Code &sect;&sect; 41-4908 - 4909 (1990), to insure owners and operators of petroleum storage tanks against possible releases of petroleum from leaky storage tanks. The funds for the trust came from the imposition of a one cent per gallon &quot;transfer fee&quot; on all petroleum products delivered or stored in Idaho, imposed upon the first licensed distributor who received the product within the state. Plaintiff oil companies filed suit against defendant government, alleging that the Act was an unconstitutional and improper exercise of the legislature's authority. Plaintiffs appealed a trial court decision granting summary judgment in favor defendant. The appeals court affirmed because the legislation served the legitimate purpose of protecting the environment and was rationally related to the goal of minimizing the products' potential harmful effects. The court also held that the Act's classification scheme, distinguishing between off-road and on-road gas, was proper since it was rationally based on findings that 20 percent of all fuel was used for off-road purposes, while 80 percent was used on the highway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the decision upholding the validity of the statute because the legislation served the legitimate purpose of protecting the environment, was rationally related to the government's goal of minimizing the potential harmful effects of petroleum products, and was not enacted in an irrational or arbitrary way.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review from the District Court of the First Judicial District of the State of Idaho, Kootenai County, which vacated an order of the appellant board revoking a dock permit issued to respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant board decided to conduct a hearing on whether to reaffirm or revoke appellant's permit to build a dock. A hearing officer conducted a de novo hearing and made a de novo decision to revoke the permit. Appellant board adopted most of the hearing officer's conclusions and issued a decision revoking the permit. The court affirmed appellant board's decision to revoke the permit. Appellant board followed the proper procedures in its decision to revoke respondent's permit. Appellant board was not required to follow an appellate standard of review. Appellant board knew it was conducting a revocation hearing and applied the correct de novo standard. Idaho Code &sect; 58-1305(a), which provided permits should be passed ordinarily except in the most unusual of circumstances, was not unconstitutionally vague. Most unusual of circumstances involved a fact specific determination and was capable of a reasonable interpretation based on the ordinary meaning of the words. Appellate board's decision to revoke the permit was supported by substantial evidence that the proposed area had been a designated swimming area free from boats for forty years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant board's decision to revoke the dock permit issued to respondent, finding appellant board was not required to apply an appellate standard of review in its decision to affirm or revoke respondent's permit because respondent provided no evidence such a standard was required. Appellant board's decision to revoke the permit was supported by substantial evidence that the proposed area was a longtime swimming area.</SPAN></P>

The federal district court certified the question of law to the court. The court held that Idaho Code &sect; 6-1603 was constitutional because it did not violate the right to a jury trial in that the cap on noneconomic damages was a modification of a common law remedy which was within the powers of the legislature and did not infringe upon the jury's right to decide cases; did not constitute special legislation in that it was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable; and did not violate the separation of powers doctrine in that the legislature merely changed the common law of personal injury which was within its power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from judgment of District Court of Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho), which, on remand of conversion action against defendant city, awarded small amount of damages, and from trial court's denial of his motion for reconsideration in which he attempted to raise constitutional issues for the first time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city gave plaintiff landowner many notices of noncompliance with duty to clean up property, and finally sent a contractor in to perform clean-up. The only issue in trial court was value of some of plaintiff's property that was taken and disposed of by defendant's contractor. The trial court, which served as finder of fact, found only three items had value, amounting to $ 604, and awarded this amount to plaintiff, who attempted to raise issues of denial of due process and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 violation in a motion for reconsideration and on appeal. The court held that defendant raised his constitutional issues too late to preserve them for appeal. Therefore, it looked only to the findings of fact, to be sure they were supported by substantial evidence. In this case, there was plenty of evidence in the record to support the trial court's determination of value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed award, because constitutional issues were raised too late, and because substantial evidence of value of property taken was sufficient to support trial court's findings of fact.</SPAN></P>

Civ. P. 16(l)(1); [4]-Sanctions were not awarded because a father's persistence did not amount to harassment or unnecessary delay or unreasonably increases the costs of litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County, Idaho, convicted defendant on two counts of delivery of a controlled substance. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court erred in using the police officers' hourly rates in awarding restitution because the statute directed that only regular salaries of employees were compensable. The appellate court noted that this claim of error failed on appeal because it was not preserved. A claim of fundamental error could not be invoked to raise an issue for the first on appeal in a post-conviction case because a post-conviction proceeding was civil in nature. The fundamental error doctrine could not be invoked to raise a restitution issue for the first time on appeal because they were civil in nature. A reasonable reading of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 37-2732(i) included costs incurred for law enforcement employees' attendance at a restitution hearing. The district court properly awarded restitution against defendant relative to police costs incurred during the later two controlled buys as they were in furtherance of development of evidence admissible against defendant. Considering defendant's criminal history, his claim that his sentences were excessive was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of an order entered by the District Court of the First Judicial District, State of Idaho, Bonner County, which granted a motion to suppress evidence allegedly seized as part of an unlawful detention of a vehicle in which defendant was a passenger. Defendant was charged with misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia and felony possession of marijuana; the State only appealed in the misdemeanor case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer passed a car traveling in the opposite direction with only one headlight. That car was followed by a pickup, in which defendant was a passenger. The officer turned on his overhead lights; both vehicles pulled over into a turnout, and the officer parked his vehicle immediately behind the car. As he exited, the officer walked back to the pickup to let the occupants know that he was only stopping the car. However, the officer observed the driver and defendant were not wearing seatbelts and smelled a strong odor of unburnt marijuana; the officer searched the vehicle and found marijuana and drug paraphernalia. On appeal, the court affirmed the suppression of the evidence seized. Pursuant to Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 49-625(1), the pickup was not required to remained stopped, and was not seized, after the officer's vehicle had passed it and parked behind the car until the officer walked toward the pickup; such conduct was an indication to a reasonable person that he or she was not free to leave. Because the officer had no reasonable suspicion at that point to detain any of the pickup's occupants, the seizure was unlawful under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Third Judicial District, State of Idaho, Canyon County, affirmed a magistrate's decree of protective custody placing three of respondent parents' children in the protective custody of respondent, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, pursuant to the Idaho Child Protective Act (CPA). The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The magistrate's failure to hold a timely shelter care hearing and adjudicatory hearing and the Department's failure to timely disclose the investigation report under Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-1608(2), 16-1616(1), (2), and 16-1619(1) did not operate to divest the magistrate of subject matter jurisdiction under the CPA. In addition, the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule did not apply to child protection proceedings. Furthermore, the parents failed to show a violation of the father's Fifth Amendment Miranda rights. Also, even if the appellate court applied Brady to CPA proceedings, the parents did not demonstrate that the undisclosed evidence was favorable, that the evidence was suppressed by the Department, and that prejudice resulted. Additionally, the magistrate did not err in admitting photographs of the older children's injuries into evidence as &quot;originals&quot; under Idaho R. Evid. 1001 and 1002. Finally, under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 16-1602(1)(a), 16-1602(1)(a), and 16-1619(4), the magistrate did not err in concluding that the evidence of abuse was not justifiably explained and established the court's jurisdiction over the older child under the CPA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was driving on a two-way, predominantly two-lane, highway when her lane of travel expanded to include a left-hand lane to be used only for passing. The petitioner stayed in the right-hand lane, never entering the passing lane. The petitioner did not signal a turn or lane change as she approached the end of the double-lane expanse. The petitioner was subsequently stopped by an officer for failure to signal before moving right or left upon the highway in violation of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 49-808(1). The petitioner argued that the stop of her vehicle, which led to the breath test, was unlawful because Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 49-808(1), was void for vagueness as applied to her. The appellate court ruled that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the petitioner. Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 49-808(1) did not clearly indicate that a signal was required when two lanes merged with neither lane clearly ending and neither clearly continuing. The statute could not reasonably be given an utterly literal application to every type of side-to-side movement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a prison inmate and his wife, appealed summary judgment granted by the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County, Idaho, in favor of defendant corrections officials, arguing that the district court erred in concluding that the termination of plaintiffs' visiting privileges did not violate their constitutional rights under both the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While out on parole, the inmate absconded from supervision and fled the country with the help of his wife. He was subsequently apprehended, his parole was revoked, and he was returned to prison. His wife was charged with harboring a felon. As a result of that charge and numerous violations of visitation rules, corrections officials terminated the wife's visiting privileges. The inmate and his wife filed suit. On review of summary judgment in favor of corrections officials, the court held that the denial of visitation did not violate constitutional rights because the denial of prison access to a particular visitor was not independently protected by the Due Process Clause, as it was well within the terms of confinement ordinarily contemplated by a prison sentence. Further, because the state statutes and regulations governing visitation did not place substantial limitations on official discretion but, instead, made clear that there was no right to visit any inmate and that visitation privileges were entirely up to the discretion of a corrections officials, the statutes and regulations did not create an enforceable right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following appellant applicant's conviction for first degree murder, the applicant sought post-conviction relief. The State moved for summary dismissal. Thereafter, the applicant filed an amended application. The District Court of the First Judicial District, State of Idaho, Kootenai County, denied the application for post-conviction relief. The applicant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant contended that the State's answer, amended answer, and motion for summary dismissal did not provide adequate notice. A threshold question for the supreme court was whether appropriate notice was given. The State's amended motion for summary dismissal specifically addressed each of the four claims alleged in the applicant's amended application and listed the grounds for which the State was seeking summary dismissal. The applicant's argument that no notice was given was clearly belied by the record. The applicant also contended that his claims of unconstitutional judgment and sentence and prosecutorial misconduct should not have been summarily dismissed. The applicant, however, did not articulate any reason or point to any allegation or evidence as to why the claim should survive the bar of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-4901(b). The applicant also argued ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to assert prosecutorial misconduct. With respect to applicant's right to testify, although the applicant claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, no argument was ever presented to the district court regarding a direct constitutional violation of the applicant's right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In September 2005, the district court imposed a unified twenty-five-year sentence, with ten years determinate, following the petitioner's conviction for lewd conduct with a child under sixteen years old. The petitioner did not directly appeal the conviction or sentence, resulting in his conviction becoming final on October 14, 2005. In November 2007, the petitioner filed a pro se petition for postconviction relief. The district court summarily dismissed the petitioner's postconviction claim, deciding that it had been filed untimely and that Estrada should not be given retroactive application. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not err in dismissing the petition for postconviction relief as being untimely. The petitioner did not show that the statute of limitations for filing a postconviction petition should be tolled for any reason that Idaho courts had previously recognized. In addition, given that the Idaho Supreme Court recently stated that Estrada did not announce a new constitutional rule, the petitioner was not entitled to have the statute of limitations tolled on the basis of his contention that Estrada announced a retroactively applicable rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Valley County, Idaho, that affirmed the denial of his motion to suppress, arguing that the state trooper who stopped him lacked reasonable and articulable suspicion to conclude that he was operating his vehicle contrary to Idaho traffic laws and that Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 49-428, governing the display of license plates, was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper stopped defendant's vehicle due to the improper display of his license plate, which was fastened with one bolt and hung at a 30-degree angle. During the stop, the trooper discovered that defendant lacked a valid license, and placed defendant under arrest for driving without privileges in violation of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8001. On review, the court held that Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 49-428 was not vague because the plain and obvious meaning of the requirement that a plate be securely fastened to the vehicle to prevent the plate from swinging clearly provided notice to a driver that fastening a license plate in a manner that did not prevent it from swinging violated the statute. Further, the stop was not improper under a Fourth Amendment analysis. The trooper's testimony that he observed the license plate hanging at a 30-degree angle gave the trooper reasonable suspicion to believe that the license plate was not securely fastened and had been able to swing down. Because the trooper had reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant violated Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 49-428, the stop was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the offense of enticing of children. The appellate court concluded that, from a plain reading of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-1509(1), the language &quot;with the intent that the child shall be concealed from public view&quot; in &sect; 18-1509(1)(c) did not also modify subsections (1)(a) and (b). Nothing in the structure of the statute suggested that the intent to conceal language in subsection (1)(c) applied to subsections (1)(a) and (b). Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-1509(1) was plain on its face and the appellate court was bound by the clear language of the statute. Adding the requirement of intent to conceal the child from public view made sense so as not to criminalize all interaction with a minor which may involve movement from place to place. Defendant's void for vagueness argument was not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the failure to obtain the permission of the district court in this interlocutory appeal did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction. Accordingly, the state's failure to raise this procedural objection in the district court waived the issue of jurisdiction. The appellate court found that the city's curfew ordinance's regulation of conduct burdened expression by limiting a minor's ability to be present in public places. By restricting minors' access to all public places during curfew hours, the ordinance severely inhibited the ability of minors to exercise their First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I, rights for one-quarter of the day. A minor's freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of association were all curtailed by the curfew ordinance. The curfew ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad. The ordinance did not aim specifically at evils within the allowable area of state control but rather swept within its ambit other activities that constituted an exercise of First Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

I, XIV, Idaho Const. art. 1, &sect; 4, the Religious Exercises in Land Use and by Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc, and the Free Exercise of Religion Protected Act, Idaho Code &sect; 72-401.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, whose practiced Odinism and Native American religion, was in a maximum security institution. The warden closed a sweat lodge in the prison and regulated the inmate's possession of personal items. The district court ruled that the regulations of the institution had a valid and rational connection to a legitimate penological security interest. Under the compelling governmental interest standard, the court held that serious safety concerns arose in the maximum security prison when inmates were provided ready access to the material necessary for a sweat lodge ceremony. The prison had a compelling interest in the elimination of tobacco products and the smudging ceremony and in establishing restrictions on personal property, including the inmate's feathers and rabbit fur used for religious purposes, due to concerns including the misuse of property, ensuring security, and promoting safety. RLUIPA was not implicated because the inmate did not show how being allowed to form a group was an exercise of his religion, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc-5(7)(A). Addressing the inmate's claims under the higher RLUIPA standard, the court did not need to address his constitutional claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus in part, reversing in part for further findings on whether completely banning smudging ceremonies at the prison was the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling governmental interest of safety and security.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the sentence enhancement for being a repeat sexual offender because his Washington conviction of luring with a sexual motivation had no substantially equivalent counterpart in the listed offenses of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8304 requiring sex offender registration. The appellate court found that defendant challenged the use of the conviction for luring with a sexual motivation to justify the enhancement under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 19-2520G, but did not challenge the relevance of the conviction for communication with a minor for immoral purposes in justifying the enhancement. Defendant's argument that the enhancement for being a repeat sexual offender could not apply to him because it provided for a penalty greater than the maximum allowable penalty for the underlying charge was without merit. The minimum term of confinement of fifteen years for the sentence enhancement was properly imposed. Defendant did not question the illegality of the additional ten-year indeterminate term even though the maximum allowable penalty for the offense had already been exceeded by the minimum term mandated by &sect; 19-2520G.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A magistrate ordered appellant parents to submit to random drug tests as a condition of their daughter's juvenile probation. The District Court of the First Judicial District, State of Idaho, Kootenai County, affirmed. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter was charged with two counts of petit theft and after she admitted to the crimes, she was placed on probation. As a term of her probation, her parents were required to submit to random drug and alcohol testing. On appeal, the court held that the order violated the parents' Fourth Amendment rights because, even though both a strong State interest and a laudable purpose were served by the magistrate's order compelling the parents to submit to drug testing, the special needs exception to the warrant requirement did not legitimize the order. If the parents refused to submit to testing, they be held in criminal contempt; if they submitted and the tests disclosed drug use, presumably the test results could be used as the basis for criminal prosecution. Nothing prohibited disclosure of test results to law enforcement, as it was the daughter's probation officer who had authority to demand the tests and receive the results. In addition, if they refused to submit the parents faced revocation of their daughter's probation and the possibility of losing custody of their daughter in a child protection action.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals of Idaho held that Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, Mun. Code &sect; 5.08.160, the city ordinance that classified possession of an open container of alcohol as a misdemeanor, was in direct conflict with the state statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 23-505, which classified the offense as an infraction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the First Judicial District Court, Kootenai County (Idaho), his judgment of conviction upon his plea to aggravated battery and aggravated assault and his sentence. Defendant challenged the district court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence and the district court's reliance during sentencing on a victim impact statement in the presentence investigation report (PSI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that a warrantless entry by police officers into his residence to retrieve his wife's belongings violated his right against unreasonable searches and seizures. Upon entry, defendant shot and wounded one police officer and pointed his gun at a second officer. The court did not need to decide whether the officers' entry of defendant's home was unlawful because, even if it were, the officers did not exploit the intrusion to obtain any evidence. Although the officers acquired evidence of defendant's violent actions in close temporal proximity to their allegedly unlawful intrusion, such close temporal proximity was outweighed by the other factors in the Brown v. Illinois test. Any causal connection between the entry and the acquisition of evidence was broken. Defendant's illegal acts were independent of any police coercion caused by the intrusion into his residence. As for consideration of the victim impact statement in the PSI, the district court ruled that it was admissible only as victim input and set forth multiple reasons for defendant's sentence based on the proper sentencing factors. Defendant did not show any error in the use of the statement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the infamous crime against nature statute was unconstitutional, either facially or as applied. The district court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss. The appellate court ruled that defendant failed to satisfy his burden of proof in establishing that Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-6605 was unconstitutional as applied to the conduct in his case. Defendant had not shown that he was prosecuted for contact that occurred in private and with an adult who could and did consent. There was ample support from the record demonstrating that the victim was unable to consent or did not consent, and that the conduct occurred in public.</SPAN></P>

Regarding the inmate's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on his attorneys' failure to argue that the DNA evidence should be suppressed on Fourth Amendment grounds due to his reasonable expectation of privacy in the water bottle and his genetic identity, the appellate court determined that his claim failed because (1) his motion to suppress would not have been successful since he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the water bottle, and (2) regarding his genetic identity, it was not deficient performance of counsel to fail to argue for a novel theory in an undeveloped area of law. Regarding the inmate's claims that his trial attorney failed to communicate and failed to communicate a plea offer, these claims failed because there was evidence that his attorney met with him on multiple occasions and his testimony regarding an alleged plea offer was not credible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Ada County (Idaho), defendant was convicted of attempted strangulation of a woman with whom he was in a dating relationship, in violation of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-923. Challenging the constitutionality of the statute and the validity of a jury instruction as to reasonable doubt, defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As incorporated by reference in Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-923(5), the definition of &quot;dating relationship&quot; in Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 39-6303(2) was &quot;a social relationship of a romantic nature.&quot; Defendant contended that Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-923 was facially void for vagueness with respect to this definition. The court disagreed, noting that it could not be said that there was no type of relationship that plainly fell within this definition. Because &sect; 18-923 referred to one who &quot;willfully and unlawfully chokes or attempts to strangle&quot; an individual, yet provided that no intent to injure was required, defendant claimed that the definition of the mental element was facially vague. However, the court noted that choking could be done without an intent to inflict a physical injury. Defendant also objected to a jury instruction that defined &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; as &quot;the kind of doubt that would make a reasonable person unwilling to base an important decision on that evidence.&quot; The court concluded, however, that considering all the other components of the instruction, there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury understood it to allow conviction based on insufficient proof.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of four counts of sexual abuse of a minor under Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-1506(1)(a), (b). He petitioned for postconviction relief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, State of Idaho, Gooding County, denied his petition. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to assert on appeal that appellant's constitutional right to confront witnesses was violated when the prosecutor disclosed hearsay comments about appellant that were posted on a website because the claim was not preserved for appellate review. Counsel was not ineffective for challenging the constitutionality of Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-1506(1)(b) because it was not preserved for appeal review, as appellant never challenged its constitutionality in any way before the trial court, and therefore it would not have been addressed on appeal. However, counsel was ineffective for failing to assert that the evidence was insufficient to support appellant's conviction under &sect; 18-1506(1)(a) because the evidence showed that appellant expressed a to the victim a desire only for the victim to take photographs while appellant engaged in a sexual act. The victim did not testify that appellant conveyed any desire that the victim touch himself or touch appellant, nor was there any testimony that appellant made any physical advances or gestures toward the victim that would constitute solicitation under the terms of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed insofar as it denied appellant's motion on his claim based on an insufficiency of the evidence challenge. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a traffic stop and subsequent search of her vehicle and person, defendant was charged with possession of cocaine, possession of hydrocodone, and possession of drug paraphernalia. She moved to suppress the physical evidence and her statements made to the police during the stop. The district court granted the motion to suppress on alternative grounds, holding that defendant's vehicle was stopped without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and that the stop was unconstitutionally prolonged. The State appealed and the appellate court affirmed. Reasonable suspicion to stop a vehicle for failure to have license plates was absent if a temporary registration was properly displayed. A temporary permit displayed in compliance with Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 49-432(3) carried with it a presumption of validity, not of invalidity. There was evidence in the record that implicitly supported the district court's findings that the temporary permit was visible to the officer prior to the stop. Thus, the officer stopped defendant's vehicle without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the District Court of the Second Judicial District, State of Idaho, Clearwater County, which affirmed an order of plaintiff, the Idaho Transportation Department (ITD), suspending the driver's license of defendant after he failed a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) test. A hearing officer had upheld the ITD's one-year suspension under the administrative license suspension statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8002A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to defendant's arrest for driving under the influence and his unlawful BAC measurement, the officer seized defendant's license and issued defendant a notice of suspension. On review, the court upheld the district court's affirmance of the license suspension under &sect; 18-8002A. The court agreed that the officer had legal cause to stop defendant because the officer possessed sufficient facts to reasonably infer that defendant was driving while intoxicated. The court also found that the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant in that defendant was weaving, the officer smelled alcohol inside the vehicle, defendant had admitted to drinking two beers, and defendant's eyes were bloodshot. The officer was permitted to time the 15-minute wait required under Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-8004(4) and 18-8002A with his wristwatch rather than the Intoxilyzer printout. Even though the hearing officer erroneously reasoned that challenging the basis of the BAC test was not a relevant inquiry, defendant failed to show that his procedural due process rights were violated. The court found no substantive due process violations because defendant failed to show that &sect; 18-8002A was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's decision upholding ITD's order suspending defendant's driver's license after he failed a BAC test. The court awarded costs but not attorney fees to the ITD.</SPAN></P>

The claimant appealed the order of District Court of the Second Judicial District, State of Idaho, which forfeited the claimant's motor home and trailer, on the grounds that the conveyances were not connected to drug trafficking and that the forfeiture was unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An accomplice was growing marijuana in a barn leased by the claimant with false identification documents, and the claimant and the accomplice lived in the motor home and trailer which were parked in the barn. The claimant contended that the conveyances were only used as living quarters and were not used to store or transport marijuana and that the claimant's limited role in the marijuana operation did not warrant forfeiture of the conveyances which provided the only residence for the claimant and his wife. The appellate court first held that the conveyances were subject to forfeiture since they were used as on-site living quarters which facilitated concealment of the marijuana operation by allowing the claimant and the accomplice to avoid making frequent suspicious visits to the barn to tend the marijuana plants. However, the proportionality of the forfeiture was improperly based only on the nature of the operation, the claimant's culpability, and the connection between the conveyances and the operation. The proportionality inquiry failed to consider the monetary value of the conveyances, hardship to third parties, and factors for determining the gravity of the claimant's offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The forfeiture order was vacated, and the case was remanded for consideration of factors related to the proportionality of the forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a prowler, sought review of the decision of the District Court of the Third Judicial District (Idaho), which found in favor of respondents, sisters, in the sisters' action for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prowler took video images of the sisters and their mother in various states of undress, engaging in everyday activities. The present case involved the sisters' various tort claims. Although the sisters did not present evidence to show the origin of the copy of a videotape, the officer's testimony demonstrated that there was no break in the chain of custody up to the moment he first viewed the original tape, and he testified that there was no material difference between the two tapes. Thus, the sisters adequately demonstrated that the copy of the videotape was in substantially the same condition as the videotape that was seized from the prowler at the time of his arrest and the copy was properly admitted. The court further found that the sisters' evidence did not demonstrate a degree of mental suffering meeting the standard for a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Although emotional discomfort was described, it was not the sort of emotional turmoil from which liability could arise for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's order denying the prowler's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the sisters' claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress was reversed.

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the search of his vehicle was not justified by the facts known to the officer at that time. The court of appeals agreed. The officer had no information that defendant was carrying a weapon and did not see anything inside the vehicle that suggested a hidden weapon. The offense for which defendant had been stopped was minor, and while the officer could justifiably be suspicious about the inconsistency regarding the passenger's name, defendant was otherwise cooperative and non-threatening. While it was dark outside, there was no indication that that area of downtown Coeur d'Alene was especially perilous. The passenger's action--fleeing the automobile--might have implied some kind of criminal activity, but it was not indicative of attempting to conceal or reach for a weapon in the vehicle. Therefore, the officer did not have objectively reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant was dangerous and had access to a weapon inside the automobile. In addition, the court of appeals found that, on appeal, the State was allowed to dispute defendant's standing to challenge the search, even if it had not done so in the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the motion to suppress was vacated and the case was remanded for a determination of whether defendant possessed a privacy interest that was violated by the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of child rape in Washington. After moving to Idaho, he was charged with failure to register as a sex offender in violation of former Idaho Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-8304, 18-8307. After the First Judicial District Court of Kootenai County, Idaho, denied defendant's motion to dismiss, he entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the charge against him for failure to register as a sex offender was improper because the application of former Idaho Code Ann. &sect; 18-8304 violated his constitutional right to travel guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The appellate court agreed, finding that the State's interest in apprehending re-offending sex offenders was not rationally advanced by a classification that differentiated between offenders based solely upon their date of entry into the state. Therefore, former Idaho Code &sect; 18-8304(1)(b) created an unconstitutional burden on the right to travel insofar as it imposed a registration duty upon sex offenders with pre-July 1993 convictions who moved into the state during or after July 1993 while imposing no such duty on otherwise similarly situated longer-term residents. Because defendant fell within that burdened class, his judgment of conviction could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from a judgment of the District Court of the Second Judicial District, Idaho, that granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to his arrest on the ground that there was no legal basis under Idaho Code &sect; 23-943A for the arrest and search of defendant because &sect; 23-943A required reasonable suspicion that a person was under the age of 21 before an officer could detain and arrest them for non-compliance..</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant saw police cruisers blocking the road and yelled vulgarities at the officers. One officer ordered him to come to the cruiser, but defendant went into a nightclub. The officer went into the club, brought defendant outside, and requested that he present identification. Defendant refused and was arrested for failing to provide identification under Idaho Code &sect; 23-943A. A booking search yielded methamphetamine, for which defendant was also charged. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress. The State argued that the trial court erred in ruling that &sect; 23-943A required reasonable suspicion that a person was underage. The court held that a stop under &sect; 23-943A involved an investigatory detention because the individual was not free to refuse an officer's request for identification and walk away and that the purpose of &sect; 23-943A was to prevent underage alcohol consumption; therefore, reasonable suspicion that the individual was underage was required under the Fourth Amendment.  The court found that the State conceded that nothing in the record suggested that the officer thought defendant was underage or that he detained defendant based on reasonable suspicion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court order granting defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction entered upon her conviction for grand theft. She was convicted of stealing from her elderly stepmother-in-law. On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that the trial court did not err in finding the victim competent to testify on the day of her deposition pursuant to Idaho R. Evid. 601 because the trial court considered the testimony of the victim's guardian as well as the victim's treating physician. In addition, to the extent that the victim's deposition responses were inconsistent, or even wrong, that went more to the weight and credibility of her testimony than to its admissibility. The trial court did err by allowing expert testimony from the victim's conservator pursuant to Wash. R. Evid. 702 because the nature of the testimony had little to do with her particular expertise as a conservator. However, that error was harmless because that challenged testimony was only a small part of the entire case against defendant. Moreover, the issue of whether particular checks written by defendant were for the victim or the victim's personal benefit was not the primary issue in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that application of the forfeiture provision in Idaho Code &sect; 20-228 had to be limited to time spent on &quot;suspended parole&quot; and that failure to count the time he spent on parole towards the completion of his sentences constituted cruel and unusual punishment and placed him in double jeopardy. The appellate court found that the legislature could have concluded that forfeiture of time spent on parole provided an incentive for compliance with the terms of parole. The appellate court conducted a proportionality analysis comparing the sentence to those imposed on other defendants for similar offenses and could not say that the inmate had shown an inference of gross disproportionality due to the forfeiture of the 314 days; thus, the sentences were not cruel and unusual. The revocation of parole resulting from the violation of the terms was not a separate punishment for the inmate's underlying criminal offenses. The legislative pronouncement that an inmate should be subject to forfeiture of time spent on parole was an exercise of the legislative power to define crimes and their penalties and did not involve resentencing inmates. The inmate was not awarded attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution was denied parole. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.

Defendant was not required to raise this argument prior to trial under Idaho Crim. R. 12(b)(2). The statutes were not vague simply because the Boone and Crockett standards for determining the size of a deer were not defined. Moreover, the use of the standards was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Idaho Code &sect; 36-202(h) did not delegate authority to the Boone and Crockett hunting clubs, nor did it allow the private organizations to determine whether an offense was a misdemeanor or a felony.

In affirming, the court rejected defendant's argument that the officer had no legal justification for briefly detaining him to run a driver's license query. The court found that a seizure did not occur merely because the officer approached defendant and asked a few questions. Idaho Code &sect; 49-316 included the authority to run a status check on a license, and an officer's brief detention of a driver to run a status check, after making a valid, lawful contact with defendant, was reasonable for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.

However, the court determined that assault was not a lesser-included offense of malicious harassment. Comparison of the elements of malicious harassment with the elements of assault reflected an element in the assault crime that did not exist in the malicious harassment crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessors sued respondent lessee, a city, for rents due. The District Court of the First Judicial District, State of Idaho, Bonner County, granted the city's motion and dismissed the action with prejudice based on the lessors' failure to file a claim for damages pursuant to the Idaho Tort Claims Act (ITCA). The lessor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city built a lake water treatment plant on property that it initially leased in 1978 for an indefinite term. Following notice of a rent increase, the city made irregular payments and adhered to a prior rental term. Although reversing the dismissal, the court agreed that Idaho Code &sect; 50-219 did not violate the unity requirement of Idaho Const. art. III, &sect; 16 because its title encompassed the subject matter of damage claims against cities and fairly identified the content of the act. Therefore, compliance with the ITCA was required. The court found, however, that the letters and billing statements sent by the lessors to the city were sufficient &quot;claims&quot; to preclude summary judgment on the basis of the notice requirements of Idaho Code &sect; 50-219 and the ITCA. Counsel's letter demanded payment pursuant to the lease, described the conduct and circumstances that brought about the claimed injury in monetary terms, included relevant dates, and demanded payment of a specific amount with interest due. The annual billing statements also identified the lease by number, the parties to the lease, and tracked by date the imposition of rent, the accrual of interest, and payments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the city. Because the court vacated the grant of summary judgment, the district court's award of costs and attorney fees was also vacated. Costs on appeal were awarded to the lessors.</SPAN></P>

On intermediate appeal, the district court reversed the magistrate, holding that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. The court affirmed, stating that the ordinance was content neutral because it restricted excess sound levels regardless of the content. The ordinance was also narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest because governments had a legitimate interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, and peace of their citizens as well as their traditional public forums such as city streets and parks, from excess noise. The ordinance was also not void for vagueness because the ordinance gave fair notice as to the prohibited conduct, did not impose any subjective standard for its application, and did not invite arbitrary enforcement.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed, asserting the indictment was inadequate to allege an offense, and that the jury instructions did not correctly state the law, with regard to the mental element, in felony injury to child cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were homeschooling the child. The child exhibited behavior problems, including bed-wetting, violence toward siblings and pets, and stealing, and defendants, allegedly on the advice of a counselor, began using food limitations as a form of discipline. However, the food limitations were extreme, and a detective and a social worker found the child suffered from malnourishment and related health effects, which led to the instant charges. As to the sufficiency of the indictment, the portion of Idaho Code &sect; 18-1501(1) under which defendants were prosecuted, criminalized endangerment of a child victim only if the defendant had the &quot;care or custody&quot; of the child. However, the appellate court held the language in the indictment was sufficient to charge defendants with felony injury to a child, pursuant to &sect; 18-1501(1). However, the appellate court held it was error for the district court to give an instruction based upon the &sect; 18-101(1) definition of &quot;willfully,&quot; because the instruction did not correctly describe the state of mind element, and may have led the jury to believe that defendants would be guilty even if they did not &quot;intentionally or knowingly endanger&quot; the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions were vacated, and the matter was remanded to the district court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of the Second Judicial District, State of Idaho, Latah County, which affirmed a magistrate's entry of a conviction against him for driving a motor vehicle without a valid license in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 49-301.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge before trial based on his claim that he had been denied a driver's license by the Idaho Department of Transportation because he refused to provide his social security number. The magistrate denied the motion, and also implicitly denied his subsequent motion to dismiss due to lack of jurisdiction when the magistrate proceeded to trial. Defendant was convicted as charged and appealed to the district court, which affirmed the judgment. Defendant sought further review and the appellate court again affirmed the conviction. The court initially noted that the magistrate had jurisdiction pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 1-2208(3)(a) because driving a motor vehicle without a valid license was a misdemeanor. The court noted that in Idaho, the right to travel and the right to operate a motor vehicle on public highways were rights protected by the constitutions. However, the court held that requiring disclosure of an applicant's social security number was within the reasonable exercise of Idaho's police power and accordingly, it was not an unconstitutional impairment of defendant's rights.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, State of Idaho, Ada County, affirmed. Defendant again challenged his convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a police officer photographed defendant's vehicle, defendant filed a complaint. Defendant later telephoned the investigating officer, used profanity, and made several threats. When he was arrested, defendant resisted, and he continued this behavior at the county jail. Defendant was convicted as charged, and the court affirmed on appeal. The court agreed with the trial court that the requisite intent under Idaho Code &sect; 18-6710 had to exist at the time a telephone call was initiated. Defendant had the requisite intent, given that he called the officer a profane name 21 seconds into the conversation. While defendant claimed that &sect; 18-6710 was unconstitutional, the court did not address this issue because it was not properly preserved for appellate review. Given defendant's actions during his arrest and thereafter in refusing to cooperate and in using profane language repeatedly, there was substantial evidence to support his conviction under Idaho Code &sect; 18-705. Contrary to defendant's argument, the State did not improperly advise the jury during closing arguments, and thus there was no showing of prosecutorial misconduct. Defendant's sentences were not unreasonable or excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by summarily dismissing his application for postconviction relief because his sentence was illegal in that the jury made no specific finding that he used a firearm during the murder. The court of appeals disagreed. The jury was instructed that an essential element of the crime of first degree murder was that defendant intentionally, willfully, deliberately, and premeditatedly killed the victim by shooting him with a firearm. The jury thereafter found defendant guilty of first degree murder. The requirement that defendant's use of a firearm be specifically found by the jury was satisfied and, therefore, defendant failed to show that his sentence was illegal by virtue of the firearm enhancement. In addition, to the extent that defendant contended that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the lack of a specific finding by the jury that he used a firearm during commission of the murder, such contention was without merit. Therefore, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's application for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, State of Idaho, Ada County, convicted defendant of misdemeanor domestic battery arising from an attack on his girlfriend with whom he cohabited. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the conviction on the basis that the definition of &quot;household member&quot; in the domestic violence statute,&nbsp;Idaho Code &sect; 18-918 (1998), did not encompass unmarried cohabitants or alternatively, that the definition was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court found that, examining the statutory definition as a whole, it plainly encompassed: (1) spouses, (2) former spouses, (3) persons who had a child in common regardless whether they had been married, and (4) persons who were cohabiting, regardless of whether they had been married or held themselves out to be married. Defendant's battery of the victim was enjoined by statute. Defendant had no standing the challenge the vagueness of the statute as it might be hypothetically applied to the conduct of the others. When defendant objected to the prosecutor's argument, the objection was sustained; therefore there was no ruling unfavorable to defendant for the appellate court to review. Although the prosecutor should not have told the jury to take a look at the tort claim, her argument addressing defendant's testimony about the tort claim was not improper. There was no misconduct to necessitate a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his right to a fair trial was violated when the district court forced him to proceed through trial dressed in jailhouse clothing. The appellate court found that defendant did not expressly object to being tried in jailhouse clothing. Defendant's informal request for a delay in order to obtain civilian clothing was insufficient to put the district court on notice that he was asserting a violation of his constitutional right to a fair trial. The information specifically alleged that defendant inflicted traumatic injury on the victim by breaking her nose and causing other injuries. Even if the State failed to convince the jury that defendant broke his girlfriend's nose, a conviction for felony domestic battery would be supported based on a finding that defendant caused other traumatic injuries. After considering the nature of the crime and the mitigating factors, the period of incarceration was necessary to adequately protect society. Defendant did not submit new information in support of his Idaho Crim. R. 35 motion; as such, defendant failed to show the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court initially noted whether justified under the exigent circumstances exception to the search warrant requirement or under Idaho's implied consent statute, a blood draw remained subject to Fourth Amendment standards. The appellate court held because of defendant's combative nature, the force employed was no greater than that which was reasonably necessary to accomplish the testing and did not violate constitutional standards. The appellate court also held there was no merit in defendant's argument that the forcible blood draw was unreasonable where it was unnecessary for his prosecution because it was not the prerogative of a defendant to determine what evidence the State gathered to support his prosecution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing he did not file a claim as contemplated by Idaho Code &sect; 20-209E. The appellate court initially noted the purpose of enacting Idaho Code &sect; 20-209E was aimed at discouraging prisoners from filing frivolous civil lawsuits, particularly against the state. The appellate court held the motions and letters filed by defendant were not independent causes of action but, rather, were documents filed in an ongoing criminal proceeding, and did not support prison disciplinary action against him.</SPAN></P>

The warrant issued, contraband was seized, and defendant was arrested. Following his guilty plea, defendant appealed, arguing the trial court erred when it determined that the search warrant for his shed was properly issued, as it was unsupported by probable cause. He also contended the mandatory fine the trial court assessed constituted an unconstitutional infringement of the separation of powers doctrine. The appellate court held, under the totality of the circumstances, the anonymous informant's direct observations, coupled with the corroboration by other sources, provided a sufficient basis for the magistrate's finding of probable cause to search defendant's shed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant operated a business that sold do-it-yourself legal forms designed for use by non-lawyers wishing to represent themselves in court or to conduct transactions without the assistance of an attorney. He was charged with misdemeanor unlawful practice of law for legally advising two individuals and assisting them in the preparation of pleadings in two civil cases. The magistrate court found Idaho Code &sect; 3-240, proscribing the unlawful practice of law, was constitutionally infirm due to either overbreadth or vagueness, but the trial court reversed the decision. On appeal, defendant argued the statute's prohibition was facially overbroad because it prohibited speech that was protected by the First Amendment, and that the statute violated due process guarantees because it was unduly vague. The appellate court held Idaho Code &sect; 3-420 did not suffer constitutional infirmity due to either overbreadth or vagueness because it plainly covered a wide range of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscribed conduct, and defined the offenses with sufficient clarity to allow defendant an opportunity to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion, and defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty. On appeal, the court reversed. The court agreed with defendant's constitutional argument, and held that the statute was unconstitutional on its face. In reviewing the scope of the statute, the court noted that the statute's proscription extended to photographs or electronic recordings of minor having no sexual or offensive content. Furthermore, the statute did not proscribe only photographs or recordings that harmed minors. Instead, the statute included in its prohibition photographs of innocuous content that were taken without a minor's knowledge, and which were not distributed or used in a harmful way against the minor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was serving an indeterminate life sentence following his conviction for murder. Petitioner alleged that, as applied to him, the rule rescission under Idaho Admin. Code 50.01.01, which rescinded the requirement that reconsideration hearings be conducted no less frequently than every thirty months was a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution. The appellate court concluded that the magistrate who ruled on petitioner's habeas corpus petition and his request for appointed counsel did not have the benefit of a recent United States Supreme Court decision, that retroactive application of such a rule change reducing the frequency of parole hearings could violate the Ex Post Facto Clause either facially or as applied if application of the rule would result in a longer period of incarceration than under the earlier rule. The latter decision called for an individualized as-applied analysis even where retroactive application of an amendment was not facially unconstitutional, Therefore, the appellate court held petitioner's claim was not frivolous, and he consequently was entitled to court-appointed counsel pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 19-852.</SPAN></P>

The instant court held the trial court properly excluded the expert testimony regarding the effects of alcohol. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining, under the plain language of &sect; 18-116, that defendant was not entitled to expert testimony to show the effect of alcohol on his mental state at the time of the offense. Section 18-116 did not violate federal due process protection. Although the trial court should have given a jury instruction regarding involuntary manslaughter, its failure to do so was harmless error. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence of 15 years fixed.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The State presented evidence that police discovered several hundred tablets containing pseudoephedrine under the defendant's bed. Evidence was also produced showing that police seized various chemicals and equipment commonly used in the manufacture of methamphetamine (including lithium batteries and anhydrous ammonia) from the defendant's bedroom. The officer stated that he found a one-gallon jar containing a white residue in the defendant's bathroom. The officer testified that, based on his experience investigating methamphetamine labs, that one-gallon jar indicated that the defendant had begun the process of separating the pseudoephedrine from the binding material contained in the tablets. Lab reports presented by the State confirmed that the material in the jar contained pseudoephedrine. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. Continuation of the detention beyond the initial reason for the stop was justified by reasonable suspicion that the vehicle contained drugs. Factors then known to the officer which contributed to the reasonable suspicion included the following: (1) while the officer was driving alongside the car, the defendant was sitting low in the passenger seat puffing excessively on a cigar while the driver assumed a position that could have been intended to block the officer's view of the passenger; (2) after the stop, the officer noticed a very strong cigar odor coming from the car; (3) the defendant and a passenger gave inconsistent stories about the purpose of their trip; and (4) the officer discovered a bag of cooked pork chops in the back seat which might have been intended to distract a drug dog. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying the motion.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. A sergeant was responding to a call for assistance from an officer. Upon arriving, he found the officer appearing dazed and unable to focus his eyes. The officer informed the sergeant that the defendant had struck the officer in the neck. That provided probable cause to arrest the defendant for battery. In addition, the evidence showed that before the sergeant utilized his baton, the defendant had already delayed and obstructed the sergeant by refusing to comply with the order that the defendant get down to the ground. Therefore, even assuming, arguendo, that use of the baton amounted to excessive force, the defendant could properly have been found guilty of the charged offense for his behavior before the alleged excessive force was applied. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant moved to suppress evidence of his blood alcohol content (BAC), and the motion was denied.

The defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the results of his BAC test because he revoked his consent when he refused to submit to a blood test and the consequence of his refusal was the suspension of his driver's license. The court of appeals disagreed. A driver had the physical ability to refuse to submit to an evidentiary test, but that did not create a statutory right for a driver to withdraw his previously given consent to an evidentiary testing for alcohol, drugs or other intoxicating substances. Taking blood with probable cause, but without a warrant, was justified under the exigent circumstance exception to the warrant requirement, since blood alcohol concentration began to dissipate due to the body's natural metabolism of alcohol shortly after a person stopped drinking. The seizure of samples of the defendant's blood obtained without the use of force was constitutionally reasonable. Idaho had a compelling interest in protecting citizens from the damage caused by drunk drivers and that interest was heightened when a drunk driver caused a collision resulting in injury or death. Therefore, the trial court did not err.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal the defendant submitted that his racist beliefs were irrelevant to his sentencing for an offense against white victims and that the district court's consideration of his racial philosophy in denying the Idaho Crim. R. 35 motion therefore violated his rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association under the First Amendment. Defendant requested a new Rule 35 hearing in which evidence of his racial beliefs would not have been taken into consideration. The appellate court held that while the First Amendment protects an individual's right to speak and to associate with others of like beliefs, it does not prohibit consideration of a defendant's racial animus in structuring a sentence, if the evidence was relevant to legitimate sentencing issues. Applying that rule to the case at bar, the court concluded that no constitutional violation occurred. It was a permissible consideration and did not violate defendant's constitutional rights of free speech or free association. In light of the violent nature of the offense, there was no abuse of discretion in the denial of defendant's motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was charged with trafficking marijuana in the Bonner County District Court (Idaho). The defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence and moved for dismissal of the charges, or alternatively, to vacate the order which bound him over for trial. The court denied the defendant's motions to dismiss and quash, and granted his motion to suppress in part. The State appealed and the defendant cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred by suppressing evidence: (1) obtained by thermal imaging because it was not a search; and (2) suppressing the defendant's statements because they were not involuntary. The court of appeals held that: (1) the trial court had not erred because obtaining by sense-enhancing technology any information regarding the interior of a home that could not otherwise have been obtained without physical intrusion into a constitutionally protected area constituted a search where the technology in question was not in general public use; and (2) the trial court had erred because the threat to arrest the defendant's wife was not unjustified; the detective expressly conditioned the prospective arrest upon the police finding physical evidence linking the defendant's wife to the marijuana cultivation, such evidence, if found, would have justified her arrest, and the detective did not suggest that the defendant could prevent his wife's arrest by confessing, so the agent's comment did not pressure the defendant to make a statement.</SPAN></P>

As the discussion escalated, defendant told the officer in a loud voice to &quot;fuck off.&quot; In addition to the officer with whom he was speaking, a number of other individuals overheard defendant's comments including two additional officers, two employees of the records department, and two members of the public. Defendant moved to dismiss the resulting disturbing the peace charge, because, he asserted, the charge violated his free speech rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The magistrate denied his motion; a jury then found him guilty. He appealed. The trial court affirmed. After the trial court affirmed, the appellate court found defendant used fighting words with the specific intent of vexing or annoying the officer as indicated by the loud and boisterous way in which defendant spoke. Under the circumstances, the speech was not constitutionally-protected, especially because the witnesses could not simply avert there gaze to avoid the offending language.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sheriff's deputy decided to stop defendant's vehicle because he believed that it was too noisy to be in compliance with an Idaho statute governing vehicle noise, Idaho Code &sect; 49-937. Defendant was wearing sunglasses. The deputy suspected that defendant was wearing the sunglasses to conceal his eyes from the deputy's view, and he asked defendant to remove the sunglasses. When defendant did so, the deputy could see that defendant's eyes were bloodshot, and he suspected that defendant was under the influence of alcohol. On appeal, defendant argued that the magistrate should have granted his motion to suppress evidence obtained during the traffic stop because &sect; 49-937 was unconstitutional and because the deputy's request that defendant remove his sunglasses was an illegal search. The instant court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 49-937. Thus, the magistrate properly held that the traffic stop was lawful. The deputy's request or directive for defendant to remove his sunglasses did not constitute a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, as defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the appearance of his eyes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff attorney filed an action in the District Court of the Third Judicial District, State of Idaho, Canyon County, seeking a declaratory judgment that he was entitled to recover attorney fees from proceeds of a personal injury settlement in preference to the respondent hospital which claimed a lien on the same proceeds. The district court ordered that the proceeds be applied first to the attorney's fees. The hospital appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney represented a person who was injured and treated by the hospital. The attorney settled with the injured person's insurance company and the hospital asserted a lien on the proceeds. The hospital argued that: (1) the attorney did not have a statutory lien to the proceeds of the settlement; and (2) the attorney was not entitled to the proceeds under the common fund doctrine. The court of appeals held: (1) the attorney was not entitled to a statutory lien because the plain language of Idaho Code &sect; 45-701 made the commencement of an action or counterclaim a prerequisite for the creation of an attorney's charging lien and the attorney had not commenced an action, he had settled before filing suit; and (2) the common fund doctrine was not appropriate for the case because the hospital did not stand in the shoes of the injured party as a subrogee, rather, it was a creditor who possessed a lien on the tort recovery to secure payment of its charges for services provided to the injured person; the hospital was entitled to payment from the injured person regardless of whether compensation was ever received from a third party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment and restitution orders of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, State of Idaho, Ada County, which convicted him of six counts of sexual exploitation by a medical care provider in violation of Idaho Code &sect; 18-919. Defendant also appealed from the denial of all of his pre-trial motions and the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was suspended by the Idaho State Counselor Licensing Board and fined $ 3,000. The criminal charges were based on defendant having sexual contact with six female patients during treatment sessions. Defendant was charged with three counts, then later charged with three additional counts. Defendant pled not guilty to the first three counts on August 25, 1999, the trial date was set for April 10, 2000, defendant objected, and moved to dismiss the three counts pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 19-3501(3). The appellate court found that: (1) the $ 3000 fine was not a criminal punishment, and defendant's subsequent criminal prosecution did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the federal or state constitutions; (2) Idaho Code &sect; 18-919 was not unconstitutionally overbroad and the district court was correct in rejecting the jury instruction regarding lack of consent; (3) defendant's right to a speedy trial was violated as to counts I-III because court congestion could not constitute good cause for the delay; (4) defendant was not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea to counts IV-VI; and (5) the sentence was not an abuse of discretion, but some of the restitution orders were.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restitution orders for Counts I-III and the order to the Victims Compensation Fund for Count IV were reversed.

Defendant's judgments of conviction and sentences for Counts I-III were vacated, and defendant's judgments of conviction and sentences for Counts IV-VI were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions, in Fourth Judicial District Court, Ada County (Idaho), of killing deer out of season, arguing that Idaho Code &sect; 36-1101(a) violated Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 1, that disparate treatment of ranchers and gardeners violated equal protection guarantees, and that deer's depredations took property without compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants participated in killing a buck in one defendant's garden without obtaining a permit from the appropriate Idaho wildlife agency as required by Idaho Code &sect; 36-1101(a). In defense against subsequent prosecutions, they argued violations of property rights guaranteed by Idaho Const. art. I, violations of equal protection guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Idaho Const. art. I, &sect; 2, and unlawful taking of a defendant's garden without compensation. The high court found no constitutional violations. The out-of-season killing law was directed to the common welfare and did not unreasonably limit the options of a gardener whose crops were being destroyed, since it provided many alternative remedies. There was no equal protection violation in treating gardeners and ranchers differently, because they were not similarly situated in dealing with wildlife threats. Finally, wildlife depredations did not constitute takings by the State, nor was State taking ever a criminal defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, because statute promoted common welfare and reasonably limited defendants' activities, ranchers and gardeners were not similarly situated, and wildlife depredations were not takings by the State.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered an Alford plea to eluding a peace officer. Later, the trial court denied defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and other post-conviction motions. On appeal, the appellate court determined that defendant could not collaterally attack a prior conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel in that prior proceeding for purposes of defending against a subsequent persistent violator enhancement under Idaho Code &sect; 19-2514. In addition, the appellate court noted that Idaho Crim. R. 35 could not be used as the procedural mechanism to attack the validity of the underlying conviction. Further, the appellate court found the trial court properly concluded that defendant's attorney had not misinformed him about whether he could challenge the validity of his prior conviction on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel as part of an Idaho Code &sect; 19-2514 proceeding. Accordingly, the appellate court concluded defendant's application for post-conviction relief failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact, and summary disposition was correctly granted in favor of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant was charged with a drug offense. He pled guilty. A jail sentence was imposed. The trial court suspended judgment and retained jurisdiction pursuant to Idaho Code &sect; 19-2601. Near the end of the retained jurisdiction period, the jurisdictional review committee recommended to the trial court that jurisdiction be relinquished. Without affording appellant any chance to rebut the committee's recommendations, the trial court relied on the committee's report, relinquished jurisdiction, and ordered into execution the previously suspended sentence. Appellant challenged that holding and alleged the statute, amended in 1995 to eliminate any due process right an inmate had in Idaho's retained jurisdiction program, was unconstitutional. The court reversed. The court held an inmate maintained a due process right in the method used to create the report upon completion of the retained jurisdiction. Therefore, the court held that to the extent the amendment foreclosed due process protections, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action against defendant tax commission after defendant determined that plaintiffs owed income taxes.

Plaintiffs argued that &sect; 63-3049 did not govern declaratory judgment actions against defendant. The complaint was filed after the 91 day period had run. The declaratory judgment action could not be used to avoid the consequences of failing to comply with statutory procedural requirements. District court correctly dismissed the declaratory judgment action because the action was time barred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applied to the county zoning commission for a permit to operate a towing business. The commission denied the permit, and its appeals board affirmed. After filing a motion for re-hearing with no response, petitioner filed for judicial review. The district court dismissed because the petition was untimely under Idaho Code &sect; 67-6521(1)(d). Petitioner appealed arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to disqualify the district judge and in holding that his petition was time-barred. The court found that the agency's decision on petitioner's application was quasi-judicial, and that petitioner could not disqualify the judge because he sat in an appellate capacity. Petitioner's motion did not postpone the time limit for filing a judicial review petition because the appeals board was not empowered to act on motions for reconsideration. Additionally, Idaho Code &sect; 67-6521(1)(d) preempted the county ordinance allowing a 60-day period to petition for judicial review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for judicial review was properly dismissed because it was untimely, and petitioner's motion to disqualify the district judge was proper because the rules of civil procedure did not authorized disqualification without cause when the judge was engaged in appellate review.</SPAN></P>
