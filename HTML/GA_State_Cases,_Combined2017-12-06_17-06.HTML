</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Habersham and Rockdale Counties Superior Courts (Georgia) awarded appellees non-custodial fathers custody of their children after holding that the &quot;best-interest-of-the-child&quot; standard of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-7-1(b.1) was unconstitutional. In a consolidated action, appellants maternal grandparents challenged the judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In both actions in the consolidated appeal, the minor children were living with appellants when appellees, single, noncustodial fathers, sought custody. In both cases, the trial courts determined that it would be in the children's best interest to remain with appellants, but awarded custody to appellees on the ground that the &quot;best interest of the child&quot; standard of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-7-1(b.1) was unconstitutional. On appeal, the instant court reversed, holding that &sect; 19-7-1(b.1) was constitutional as applied to custody disputes between a noncustodial parent and a third party. The court interpreted the best interest standard to mean that the third party had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the child would suffer physical or emotional harm if custody were awarded to the biological parent. Once the showing was made, the third party then had to show that a custody award to him would promote the child's welfare and happiness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgments reversed and cases remanded. Under the court's interpretation of the parent-third party custody statute, the best interest of the child standard was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Bibb County Superior (Georgia), which denied his motion for acquittal after he was indicted for rape, asserting that the requirement of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-7-170, that he be tried within two terms of his demand for a speedy trial, was not met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-7-170 required that one under indictment who demanded a speedy trial had to be tried in the court term in which the demand was made or at the next succeeding regular court term thereafter, provided there were juries impaneled and qualified to try him. If not, he would be absolutely discharged and acquitted of the offense charged. A term in which no juries were impaneled and qualified to try the case did not count for purposes of the statute. The record was devoid of any evidence that jurors were impaneled and qualified to try him when appellant filed his demand, or during the remainder of the December 1999 term, or during the February 2000 term. Without a showing that jurors were impaneled in the two relevant terms, there was nothing in the record from which the appellate court could conclude the trial court erred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee brought a paternity action against appellant. Appellant moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the statutory scheme for paternity actions under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 19-7-43 et seq. was unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion, entered judgment for appellee, and denied appellant's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the instant court affirmed. Because the determination of paternity was only incidental to the paternity statute's purpose to establish a father's duty of child support, the court held that there was no merit to appellant's claim that the paternity statute discriminated on its face because fathers could not sue to establish parental rights under the terms of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed because the paternity statute did not create an improper gender-based classification and discriminate against fathers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court (Georgia) convicted appellant of aggravated child molestation and child molestation. Appellant challenged the judgment, arguing that the evidence was insufficient and that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-6-4(c), (d) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted for molesting a 13-year-old girl. On appeal, the instant court affirmed. Evidence including not only the victim's testimony that appellant had engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sodomy with her, but also appellant's letters to the victim indicating prior physical relations between the two, was sufficient to support appellant's convictions. The court overruled appellant's contention that there was no rational basis for treating child molestation based upon sodomy differently from child molestation based upon other acts, and that the different treatment violated his equal protection and due process rights. Because it was reasonable for Georgia's legislature to conclude that the psychological well-being of minors was more damaged by acts of sodomy than by acts of intercourse, and that such acts warranted a greater punishment for child molestation by sodomy, appellant's statutory challenge had no merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed because the evidence was sufficient and because the Georgia legislature reasonably determined that child molestation by sodomy warranted a greater punishment than child molestation by other acts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted relief on respondent's claim he was improperly denied eligibility for parole and ordered the parole board to consider respondent for parole. The court reversed that ruling. Respondent then filed another trial petition in the trial court, asserting his guilty plea was based upon the unconstitutional statutes. The trial court denied petitioner's motion to dismiss the second petition as successive because the first trial court never ruled on petitioner's claim that the statutes were unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee wife filed for divorce. Appellant husband filed acknowledgment of service, but not responsive pleadings. Some months later, on a day which began with a domestic dispute, appellee, without notice to appellant, obtained a protective order and final decree of divorce. The instant court granted discretionary appeal to appellant. The court noted that appellant had waived notice of the hearing on the final decree under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-5(a) by not filing responsive pleadings. Since appellant was represented by counsel of his own, appellee's counsel was not required by professional responsibility to inform him of the final hearing, independent of his statutory waiver. The court found that appellee was not required to file a particular hearing request form under applicable local rules, because the form was not required for expedited hearings, such as the expedited hearing final hearing in this case. Finally, the judgment was not void because it was rendered by a state court judge assisting in the absence of the superior court judge. Such assistance is provided by statute, and the temporary order appellee sought would have appeared to require immediate decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Appling Superior Court, Georgia, convicting him of malice murder, armed robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, as well as sentencing him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his convictions and death sentence, raising numerous points of error concerning pretrial proceedings, both phases of his trial, and the proportionality of his sentence. The court rejected defendants' arguments and affirmed the convictions and sentence. Defendant argued, among other things, that the death penalty was disproportionate to sentences imposed in other, unspecified cases in Georgia where murder was committed under similar circumstances, because his co-indictee had not yet been tried and sentenced for the murder, and because defendant was allegedly mentally retarded. The court was not persuaded that defendant was less culpable than his co-indictee, noting the jury had before it sufficient evidence to conclude that defendant was involved in planning the armed robbery and burglary, carried the handgun to the crime scene, fired the shots from the handgun, and had shown a complete lack of remorse. Evidence of defendant's mental deficiencies was not sufficient to compel a finding that the jury's sentence of death was excessive. Accordingly, the death penalty in defendant's case was neither disproportionate nor excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions and death sentence were affirmed. Sufficient evidence supported guilty verdict for each of crimes for which defendant was convicted. Trial court committed no reversible error in pretrial, guilt-innocence, or punishment phases of trial. Death penalty was neither excessive, given insufficient evidence of defendant's mental deficiencies, nor disproportionate to penalties imposed in similar Georgia cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of murder and related crimes and sentenced him to death, because of statutory aggravating circumstances. The murder was committed during the commission of an armed robbery and kidnapping with bodily injury and was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman, in that it involved depravity of mind. The appellate court found the evidence was sufficient to find that defendant was guilty and that statutory aggravating circumstances existed. A lapse of 11 1/2 hours between defendant's receiving his Miranda warnings and making his confession did not make the confession inadmissible. Although the court stated that it would consider whether electrocution was cruel and unusual punishment if sufficient evidence was presented, defendant did not make a sufficient proffer of evidence. The sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed, as the evidence was sufficient to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of the crimes and that statutory aggravating circumstances existed. The sentence of death was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In one of two consolidated appeals from the Coweta Superior Court (Georgia), appellant challenged the trial court's refusal to dismiss appellee's complaint for not properly asserting a claim for declaratory judgment. In the second case, appellant challenged the trial court's ruling that Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-36-11, 36-70-24(4)(C) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">&nbsp;Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 36-70-20 et seq. provided for a process to resolve a county's objection to a proposed change in the use of land considered for annexation by a city. The owners of certain land requested annexation with a zoning classification allowing higher density development than was allowed under the county's zoning ordinance. The County objected, and the City and County engaged in a dispute resolution process, but were unsuccessful. Under the statute, annexation could not proceed until the objections were resolved. City filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 36-70-20(4)(C) and 36-36-11. The trial court refused to dismiss the City's complaint, giving rise to one appeal, and declared the challenged statutes to be unconstitutional, giving rise to another appeal. The appeals were consolidated. The City's inability to annex property under a statute it alleged to be unconstitutional created a justiciable controversy which was the proper subject of a complaint for declaratory relief. Since the statutes did not implicate substantive zoning matters, they did not conflict with the City's power to zone land within its boundaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's refusal to dismiss the City's complaint was affirmed because it presented a justiciable controversy properly resolved by a complaint for declaratory relief. The trial court's declaration of the challenged statutes as unconstitutional was reversed because their purpose did not conflict with the constitutional delegation to a city of the power to zone land within its boundaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Several actions were brought against defendants, lessee and sublessee of a park, and security companies for the park, for wrongful death and personal injuries stemming from the park bombing which occurred during the 1996 Olympics. Defendants were granted summary judgment by the trial court as it found that Georgia's Recreational Property Act (RPA), Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 51-3-20 et seq., insulated defendants from liability. The RPA limited the liability of an owner of land who made property available without charge to the public for recreational purposes. The several actions were consolidated on appeal to the court, which remanded the action because it could not determine if the trial court considered all of the applicable factors in determining if the RPA shielded defendants from liability. The court did find that the RPA was not vague or unconstitutional. However, the court agreed that the defendant security companies were not liable to plaintiffs under terms of their contracts. Defendant sublessee was also not liable because it was not an owner or occupier where the injuries occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded; it could not be determined from the record whether the trial court properly considered all the factors in determining whether the Georgia Recreational Property Act applied.</SPAN></P>

City Code &sect; 6-1548 prohibited the use of appellant's amphibious vehicles as tour service vehicles except on specific roads outside appellee's historic district. Appellant contended the local city code was preempted by the Georgia Public Service Commission's authority to regulate the business of common carriers, as appellants had already been approved by the state and federal agencies to conduct its tours. Appellants also argued the local city code violated appellant's state and federal due process and equal protection rights. The trial court granted judgment for appellees. Appellants challenged that holding. The court affirmed. The court held the Georgia Constitution had an exception to the rule regarding preemption that allowed local governments to exercise their police powers so long as they were not in conflict with the general law, which was true in the present case. The court also held that neither appellant's due process nor its equal protection rights were violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for reckless driving and violating the limits on sound volume produced from within an automobile from the Troup County State Court (Georgia).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ga. Unif. Super. Ct. R. 31.1 required motions, demurrers, and special pleas to be made and filed at or before time of arraignment, unless time was extended by the judge in writing prior to trial. As the rule was not followed, it was not error for the court to refuse to sustain the special demurrer to the reckless driving charge, even though that decision was not made on the basis of the rule. Even if it was proper to view the count as phrased in the alternative, there was no error in overruling the demurrer. The accusation used the language of the statute, included the essential elements of the offense, and was sufficiently definite to advise defendant of what he had to be prepared to confront. The reckless driving charge included all the essential elements of the crime, and no alleged defect in the accusation harmed him. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute placing limits on sound volume produced from within an automobile, asserting it was vague because a person had to guess whether sound from his vehicle could have been heard at a distance of 100 feet. The plain language of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-14(a) provided clear notice of what conduct was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

The statute prohibiting sound &quot;plainly audible&quot; at a distance of 100 feet provided an objective standard with which persons could have complied and was not unconstitutional. The reckless driving charge included all of the essential elements of the crime, and no alleged defect in the accusation harmed defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of four counts of malice murder and other crimes, and sentenced to four death sentences. The court affirmed, holding that appellant's confession was voluntarily made. Appellant signed and reviewed his waiver-of-rights form, and the two-hour interview culminated in a videotaped confession. Appellant was lucid, and was not promised anything in exchange for his statement. Further, there was no violation of appellant's discovery rights, and all of the jurors acknowledged the obligation to decide the case based solely on the evidence. There was no error in the admission of victims' videotaped testimony under the child hearsay statute. It was not error to allow mental health experts to testify, even though they were not called as rebuttal witnesses. It was not error to deny appellant's motion to bar execution by electrocution without holding a hearing. The court reversed in part, because the aggravated child molestation conviction merged into the aggravated sodomy conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A grand jury returned an 11-count indictment charging defendant with numerous traffic offenses stemming from her fatal collision with a 13-year-old child who was riding a bicycle on the side of the roadway. Defendant's blood revealed metabolites of marijuana. She moved to dismiss five of the charges that were based on marijuana use. The trial court dismissed three, but refused to dismiss the other two: reckless driving, in violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 10-6-390(a), and first degree vehicular homicide, in violation of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-393(a). Defendant filed an interlocutory appeal asserting that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-391(a)(2) was unconstitutional as violative of equal protection. The reviewing court affirmed the judgment, finding that defendant's premise was based on her being charged with violations of driving under the influence, which was not the case. It did not matter whether defendant consumed marijuana legally or illegally. The charges merely included the fact that marijuana was found in defendant's blood because it was relevant to the jury's determination that defendant drove in reckless disregard for the safety of persons or property.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that applying amended &sect; 19-7-40 to him unconstitutionally deprived him of the right to trial by jury. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, noting that it was without question that defendant had a right to a jury trial when he filed his demand. This right vested in defendant upon his demand for a jury trial. Therefore, the 1997 amendment to &sect; 19-7-40 was unconstitutionally applied to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants were arrested in different counties for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Each appellant was read an implied consent notice regarding chemical testing as mandated by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-5-67.1. Each appellant objected at trial to admission of the blood test results, alleging that the implied consent notice was unconstitutional. Both appellants were convicted and on appeal, the court affirmed. Appellants claimed that the implied consent notice was incomplete, misleading, and coercive because they were told that refusal to submit to testing would result in suspension of their driver's licenses while consent to testing would result in only a possibility of suspension, and because they were not told that test results could be used against them at trial. The court found the Georgia Constitution allowed the State to compel blood and breath testing without warning that the results could be used at trial. The right to refuse a test was created by the legislature, which had the right to impose penalties upon making that choice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgments affirmed; implied consent statute was constitutional, because Georgia Constitution allowed State to compel blood and breath testing without warning that the results could be used against appellants at trial.</SPAN></P>

Further, the father's agreement transferring parental power to appellee pursuant to Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, former employees of the Fulton County Department of Family and Children Services (DCFS) who transferred to state employment after July 1, 1982, sued appellant for, among other things, breach of contract, estoppel, and violation of their right to equal protection in connection with retirement benefits. The trial court found that Ga.

The trial court ruled against appellees on the contract and estoppel claims. The court affirmed the finding that &sect; 47-2-334 violated equal protection. There was no rational basis for allowing employees performing the same type of work as appellees to receive greater benefits solely on the basis of the date upon which they transferred to state employment. Because the court found that the ruling in favor of appellees on their equal protection claim was proper, it dismissed appellees' cross-appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Fulton County Superior Court (Georgia) dismissing his petition for declaratory judgment on the ground that appellant was not a proper party to challenge the constitutionality of Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pled guilty to knowingly making false statements for the purpose of influencing the action of an FDIC-insured bank and he subsequently was convicted of bribery. Five years after the bribery conviction, the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance issued a notice of intent to revoke the license of a mortgage lending company founded by appellant on the ground that appellant was a convicted felon and was prohibited by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 7-1-1004(e) from serving as an employee or agent of a mortgage lending company. Appellant filed a petition for declaratory and injunctive relief, challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 7-1-1104(e), but the trial court found that appellant was not a proper party to bring such a challenge. The court reversed, finding that appellant had established that &sect; 7-1-1004(e) was sufficiently hurtful to him to give him standing to raise a constitutional challenge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment reversed; appellant was harmed by the statute because it made it impossible for him to work or operate in the mortgage lending industry; thus, he had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and her accomplice conspired to kill her husband, allegedly at defendant's request and insistence. The other party forced the victim to drive to a remote location, where he repeatedly stabbed him. Defendant was convicted of malice murder and sentenced to death. The appellate court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Media coverage of the crime was neither so extensive and inflammatory nor so reflective of an &quot;atmosphere of hostility&quot; as to require a change of venue. The trial court did not err in refusing to strike for cause the jurors who had some knowledge of the event through media coverage. That court also did not err in striking a juror who equivocated about whether she could impose the death penalty and became distraught during questioning on the topic. The trial court did not err in excluding testimony by one of the victim's co-workers about a statement made by the victim. The admission of photographs of the victim's body at the crime scene was proper. Closing argument by defense counsel was not improperly limited. The prosecutor did not commit misconduct. Defendant's sentence of death was not out of proportion to the crime committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's friend shot and killed his girlfriend and went to appellant's home. Appellant and his mother told police that friend was not in the house, and appellant's mother consented to a search. When officer looked into a closet, friend fatally shot him. Officer's murder was only indirectly attributable to appellant's false statement. Friend directly caused the death of officer and there was no evidence whatsoever that appellant was acting in concert with friend or was otherwise a party to the actual shooting. Because appellant did not directly cause officer's death, the court reversed the conviction for felony murder. The evidence clearly authorized a jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant lied when he told the police that friend was not present; therefore, appellant was guilty of the crime of making a false statement. The State challenged appellant's peremptory strikes. State showed discriminatory intent. Therefore, three jurors were reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment reversed; appellant's false statement that friend was not in the house did not directly cause the death of the officer; therefore, appellant's felony murder convict was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After being tried for killing two women, defendant was convicted of malice murder, felony murder, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, cruelty to a child, burglary, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. By operation of law, the felony murder convictions were vacated. The jury recommended the death sentence, which the trial court then imposed the malice murder convictions in addition to sentences of terms of years for the other convictions. In a pre-trial motion, defendant claimed that Hispanics were underrepresented in the jury pool and moved to have his expert's population calculations adopted by the court. The trial court denied the motion stating that the 1990 Census figures were more reliable. The appellate court affirmed the convictions and sentence. It was not clearly erroneous for the trial court to have rejected defendant's expert's Hispanic percentage figure, which was an extrapolation from a small sample that may not have been representative of the county. Denial of defendant's motion to change venue, after having first approved the motion based on the parties' consent, was not error. Substantial evidence supported the convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions and sentence were affirmed. The lower court's finding that the jury pool was not underrepresented by Hispanics was not a clear error. Denial of motion to change venue was not error. Challenged, death-qualified jurors indicated they could be fair. Substantial evidence supported defendant's convictions. Defendant's sentence was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, who were each convicted for DUI, challenged the judgments of the DeKalb County Court and the Fulton County Court (Georgia) upholding the constitutionality of Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both appellants sought to suppress the results of their blood alcohol tests from their DUI trials on the ground that the implied consent notices read to them by police pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-5-67.1 were unconstitutional. Appellants argued that &sect; 40-5-67.1 violated their due process rights because they were advised that their refusal to submit to the test would result in a one-year suspension of their drivers licenses. The trial courts denied appellants' motions and convicted them. On appeal, the court affirmed, having determined that &sect; 40-5-67.1 was constitutional. The court held that the Georgia constitution did not protect citizens from compelled blood testing or from using the test results at trial. The choice provided by &sect; 40-5-67.1 was not coercive, nor was it misleading so that no real choice existed. There was also no requirement that the officers had to wait 20 minutes before proceeding with testing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgment affirmed. The statute was constitutional because appellants were not protected from compelled blood testing or from having the test results used at trial by the state constitution and because it was not coercive or misleading. Officers were not required to wait 20 minutes before performing the test on appellants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant filed a motion to suppress, contending that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-8-76.1 was unconstitutional because it denied him equal protection in that similarly situated adult drivers in pickup trucks were not subject to the seat belt requirement. Appellant contended that, because his evidence showed that occupants of pickup trucks were more susceptible to injury in the event of an accident than were occupants of passenger cars, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 40-8-76.1 could not be considered to have a rational relation to the goal of improving public safety unless all persons occupying pickup trucks were also required to use seat belts. The court found that appellant's evidence also showed the greater frequency of passenger-car accidents and the great likelihood of fatality when seat belts are not worn in passenger cars. Therefore, appellant did not show the absence of a rational relation between the classification drawn by &sect; 40-8-76.1 and its public safety purpose.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, rejecting his contention that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 17-10-6.1(c)(1), (c)(3) of the Sentence Reform Act of 1994 were unconstitutional because, when taken together, they rendered defense counsel ineffective by presenting an impossible conundrum in having to choose between seeking a term of years without parole, or a life sentence with a possibility of parole after 14 years. The court ruled that although the challenged statutes could have led to different consequences for a convicted felon, they by no means created a Hobson's choice for defense counsel. The court reasoned that, as counsel was always charged with acting in the best interest of the client, counsel was free to argue alternative theories before a sentencing court. Thus, because the challenged provisions did not prevent counsel from doing either of these, the statutes did not render counsel ineffective per se.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the Ordinance was unconstitutional for, among other reasons, vagueness. The court found that the ordinance had a defect because an innocent person unfamiliar with the drug culture could stand or sit in a &quot;known drug area&quot; without knowing the area had such a designation. The court could not readily assume that a person of average intelligence would be sufficiently aware of which locations were known drug areas and what innocent-seeming conduct would seem to be-drug related in the opinion of a police officer. The Ordinance was too vague to justify the imposition of criminal punishment for its violation. The Ordinance was void for vagueness because it left speculative the tests for ascertaining the line separating guilty from innocent acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was involved in a single-car collision. Because of the seriousness of her injuries, appellant was treated in accordance with trauma protocol, which included subjecting her to blood-alcohol testing.

Appellant was charged with several counts of driving under the influence, but the lower court suppressed the results of the State's test of appellant's blood-alcohol levels. Then, by used of a subpoena, the State obtained appellant's medical records. Appellant moved to quash the subpoena. The trial court denied the motion and the instant court reversed. The records were protected by appellant's constitutional right to privacy, and the use of a subpoena to obtain them denied appellant due process of law. With the exclusion of appellant's medical records from evidence, the court could not say that the remaining evidence was sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find her guilty of violating Ga.

The trial court granted an interlocutory injunction prohibiting appellant Department of Transportation from issuing tree cutting permits under the challenged law. The court affirmed because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that greater harm would result from cutting trees than from granting the injunction. The court also affirmed the trial court's refusal to disqualify appellees' counsel, a former Attorney General of Georgia, finding that official opinions written by counsel concerning proposals for vegetation control did not require his disqualification, nor did counsel have substantial responsibility for litigation concerning a predecessor statute while in office.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals reversed. Granting certiorari, the court reversed. Neither common law nor statutes imposed a duty upon physicians to disclose personal life factors which could adversely affect their professional performance. Hence, appellant's failure to disclosure was not a basis for a fraud or battery claim. Furthermore, appellee could not assert non-disclosure of a professional's life factor that was separate from a malpractice or professional negligence claim, however, such allegations could support appellee's malpractice or professional negligence claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sued defendant insurance companies in tort alleging that the acts complained of occurred in Georgia and that, by virtue of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 33-4-1(2), venue was correct in a county where at least one defendant had an agent doing business. Defendants moved to transfer venue claiming that the provision relied on by plaintiffs only applied to contract actions. The trial court agreed with defendants. The court of appeals reversed. On writ of certiorari, the state supreme court affirmed holding that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 33-4-1 was not limited to contract claims. The statute was applicable only to claims against an &quot;insurer&quot; arising out of the defendants' role as an insurer, and that requirement was satisfied in the instant case. Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 33-4-1 (2) did not provide any basis for jurisdiction in Georgia, but it was used only for its proper purpose--to decide in what Georgia court the action might be heard.</SPAN></P>

The venue provision upon which plaintiffs relied was not limited to contract claims; rather, the provision also applied to other claims asserted against insurers if the claims arose from the insurance business.

The court affirmed. The court determined that defendant's conviction of solicitation of sodomy did not violate his right to privacy and free speech because sexual activity performed in exchange for money or performed with force and against the will of a participant was not protected conduct. Further, the evidence was sufficient to enable a trier of fact to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the offenses charged. Finally, the court disagreed with defendant's assertion that the trial court erred in failing to merge the false imprisonment offense with the attempt to commit aggravated sodomy. The facts used to prove the false imprisonment were different from those used to show the essential elements of the attempt to commit aggravated sodomy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was a commercial helicopter pilot and instructor who, on several occasions, landed and then took off in a helicopter from his own dock. Neighbors who lived some 200 feet away complained of the noise, and an accusation was filed charging him with violating the Clayton County, Georgia, Noise Ordinance. By prohibiting any unnecessary or unusual sound or noise which annoys others, the ordinance failed to provide the requisite clear notice and sufficiently definite warning of the conduct that was prohibited. The court found no setting from which the three vague descriptions, &quot;unnecessary,&quot; &quot;unusual,&quot; and &quot;annoys,&quot; as applied to helicopter landings and takeoffs, could take on a reasonable degree of definitiveness. The court held that a statute was unconstitutionally vague when the standard of conduct it specified was dependent upon the individualized sensitivity of each complainant. Therefore, the court held the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and reversed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgments reversed; the noise ordinance, as applied to appellant's helicopter landings and take offs, was unconstitutionally vague because it did not provide the requisite clear notice and sufficiently definite warning of the conduct that was prohibited and the standard of conduct depended on each individual complainant's sensitivities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Catoosa County trial court (Georgia), which found him guilty of using a computer internet service to seduce or entice another person believed by him to be a child, in violation of Georgia's Computer or Electronic Pornography and Child Exploitation Prevention Act of 2007, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-12-100.2(d), and attempted child molestation, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-6-1 and 16-6-4(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the indictment and verdict against him were contrary to law because there was no actual victim and the victim described in the complaint, a fourteen-year-old female named &quot;Sara,&quot; was a fiction created by law enforcement agents. The court upheld defendant's conviction under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-12-100.2(d) as proper because the statute expressly provided that the sole fact that an undercover operative or law enforcement officer was involved in the detection and investigation under the code section shall not constitute a defense. The court further held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that whether defendant would have committed the crime charged absent the inducement of law enforcement officers was a question for the jury without the assistance of expert opinion evidence because expert testimony that a defendant does not have the psychological characteristics of a person who is predisposed to having sexual contact with under-aged children invades the province of the jury as to the ultimate issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee property owners filed a complaint and application for injunction relief against a parking lot operator, seeking to enjoin the operator from operating its park-for-hire business, and for damages. The city was allowed to intervene, and also sought injunctive relief.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The operator argued that the trial court erred in concluding that its claim was barred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Appellees argued that because the operator failed to appeal the city's decision within 30 days, it was precluded from presenting a defense or collaterally attacking that decision. The appellate court concluded that the operator was not required to exhaust its remedies with the city to defend the action, because the action was between two neighbors and did not implicate the administrative process. The operator also argued that the trial court erred in ruling that its parking business was superseded by a permitted use. The city asserted that the horse show company's permitted or authorized use was a use pursuant to Atlanta, Ga., Code &sect; 16-18P.007(1)(d) and (2)(b). However, the city conceded that it did not issue the company a special use permit or a special administrative permit. Because the company's use was a use that was only &quot;permitted&quot; or allowed by a special administrative permit, and no such permit was issued, the use could not act to superseded the operator's nonconforming use pursuant to Atlanta, Ga., Code &sect; 16-24.005.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to life without parole for the aggravated sodomy offense and received concurrent 20-year sentences for the other two crimes. In an earlier appeal, the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a new trial was affirmed. The trial court (Georgia) denied defendant's extraordinary motion for a new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that because he satisfied all six Timberlake factors, the trial court erred in not granting his extraordinary motion for a new trial. Defendant contended that, although the gloves were available at trial, the DNA evidence on them had to be considered as separate, newly discovered evidence revealed only by the CODIS test showing that the DNA belonged to codefendant. The appellate court found no error, noting that the delay in obtaining evidence was not caused by a lack of due diligence, as required in an extraordinary motion for a new trial. In addition, defendant could have filed a motion to conduct DNA testing prior to trial and have discovered that the DNA did not match defendant but rather codefendant. Defendant also argued that because the trial court earlier determined that trial counsel was not ineffective, it could not also render the later, inconsistent opinion that trial counsel failed to exercise due diligence in testing the gloves. However, defendant overlooked the fact that the test for ineffective assistance of counsel differs from the Timberlake due diligence test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, along with two co-defendants, was convicted by a jury in the trial court (Georgia) of false imprisonment and theft by taking. The jury acquitted defendant and his co-defendants of armed robbery, aggravated assault, conspiracy, and five counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One of the co-defendants owed the victim $575; he called the victim to come to his trailer home to get the money. When the victim arrived, defendant closed the door behind him and stood with his back to the door. Another co-defendant came from a back room with a gun drawn; defendant also drew a gun and said, &quot;We fixing to kill you.&quot; The victim jumped through a glass window and ran away. When he returned with police, his truck was missing. The court held that this evidence was sufficient to support the false imprisonment conviction under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-41(a). The conviction for theft by taking was reversed because no evidence suggested whether one or more individuals took the victim's truck or that defendant did so. Additionally, the victim left the keys in open view. Defendant's wife's request for leniency did not open the door to bad character evidence in the form of defendant's prior conviction. Because the trial court had excluded the prior conviction based upon a belief that it had no discretion based on the State's failure to give notice as required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-16-4(a)(5), the trial court could consider its options under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-16-6 before re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the false imprisonment conviction, reversed the theft by taking conviction, vacated defendant's sentence, and remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed that defendant was not entitled to a new trial. While defendant unsuccessfully pursued his argument that the victim's out-of-court statements failed to satisfy the reliability requirement of the Child Hearsay Statute, former O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-16 (2011) (now O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-8-820) before trial, he never elicited a direct ruling from the trial court on whether the statute was unconstitutional and failed to lodge any Confrontation Clause objection, thereby waiving the issue. The appellate court also found that the defense chose, as a matter of trial strategy, not to confront the child victim in front of the jury due to concern about the reliability of her out-of-court statements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges arose from defendant's alleged possession of movies and images of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct on his home computer. The trial court found that the prohibition in O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-16-4(a)(3)(B) was unconstitutional as applied to defendant because it deprived him of his due process rights to have an expert examine the evidence against him and prepare a defense. The trial court ordered production of a copy of the hard drive to defendant's expert, with a provision that the U.S. Attorney grant written assurance of non-prosecution for any potential violations of federal child pornography laws. However, the U.S. Attorney did not answer letters requesting such assurances. The court held that this provision was a nullity because the trial court could not control federal prosecutors. Defendant's due process rights were not violated because was not denied access to the materials he requested by an expert of his choosing. The failure to obtain federal assurances did not prevent him from having meaningful access to the hard drive; there was no evidence that the expert would be federally prosecuted when he was examining the hard drive for a judicial proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a joint trial in the Gwinnett County Superior Court (Georgia), the three defendants and a fourth co-defendant (who was not an appellant in the current cases) were found guilty by the jury of kidnapping the victim for ransom, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-5-40 and 16-2-20. The trial court entered judgments of conviction upon the verdicts. Defendants' respective motions for new trial were denied. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because there was no evidence that the first defendant was a subscriber of the phones tapped and no evidence that his voice was heard during the wiretapped conversations, under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-5-30 and the Fourth Amendment, he lacked standing to seek suppression of the conversations from those wiretaps. Because the police had discerned that the victim was being held against his will at a particular residence, had secured a warrant to search the residence, had maintained direct observation of the residence, and had seen persons exiting the residence and leaving in vehicles, under the Fourth Amendment, the circumstances provided a lawful basis for the traffic stop of the vehicles. Because the questions to the victim, as phrased, tended to confuse issues relating to the specific type of immunity extended to the victim, the trial court did not impose unreasonable limits on the second defendant's cross-examination of the victim. Because the third defendant's trial lawyer made a reasonable decision to pursue an all-or-nothing defense strategy, the trial court did not err in rejecting his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had pled guilty to kidnapping, rape, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime with regard to an attack on his former girlfriend wherein he dragged her out of the house and raped her in the neighbor's yard. He received a sentence of 15 years in prison. Following a successful habeas challenge, defendant withdrew his guilty plea and was granted a jury trial. He was acquitted of the rape and possession charges, after which the trial court imposed a 20-year sentence. On appeal, defendant contended that the increased sentence after his new trial was vindictive. The court disagreed, noting that the presumption of vindictiveness had no application to a sentence imposed after a trial that was greater than one imposed after a guilty plea, which was the case at bar. The court further held that sufficient evidence supported the kidnapping conviction based on the evidence showing that although the time and distance spanned by defendant's forceful dragging of the victim out of the house, through the yard, and into the neighbor's yard may not have been lengthy, the movement was of sufficient duration to satisfy a finding of asportation.</SPAN></P>

Even if O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-8-34 were deemed void for vagueness and thus unconstitutional, the officer was confronted with red headlights that, based on his training and experience, he believed constituted a traffic violation and which he thought were confusing and dangerous to other drivers. Under those circumstances, there was evidence from which the trial court could find that the officer's stop was reasonable and not arbitrary and harassing. In addition, the record also reflected that, separate and apart from the issue of the red headlights, the officer stopped defendant's vehicle after discovering a discrepancy in the color of the vehicle when he ran a check on the license tag plate number, allowing the officer to infer that the license plate might have been illegally switched from another vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient was admitted to the hospital and was taken care of by the TP.

Three years after the TP's actual employer was revealed, the widow sought to add it as a party-defendant. The trial court denied that request, and it granted the hospital's SJ motion. On appeal, the court found that the widow failed to present evidence to counter the testimony provided by the hospital that the notice was posted conspicuously in a public area of the hospital for purposes of &sect; 51-2-5.1(b) and (c). An issue regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 51-2-5.1(b) was not preserved for review. The request to add the TP's employer under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-15(c) was properly denied, as the widow failed to show that the employer had notice of the institution of the lawsuit prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-3-71(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed an order from a Georgia trial court, which granted defendant's motion for a new trial after he was convicted of one count of misdemeanor &quot;loitering or prowling,&quot; in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-11-36.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An adult female jogger observed defendant driving his car slowly through a residential area while using one hand to apparently masturbate. Defendant was charged with two counts of &sect; 16-11-36, arising out of that conduct. After a bench trial, he was convicted of one count for masturbating while driving a motor vehicle in a residential area upon the trial court's finding that his conduct was alarming to the jogger. He was found not guilty of a second count. Thereafter, the trial court granted defendant's new trial motion on the ground that the State failed to show that defendant's conduct rose to the level of loitering or prowling, as defined in  &sect; 16-11-36(a). On appeal by the State, the court noted that defendant's claim in the new trial motion was essentially that the accusation was fatally defective. However, such a claim could only be made by a pre-trial general demurrer or by a motion in arrest of judgment after conviction. Accordingly, the trial court lacked authority to consider or grant a claim seeking to arrest the judgment of conviction in the motion for new trial. That portion of the trial court order was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated that part of the order of the trial court that granted a new trial, dismissed the portion of defendant's motion for new trial which, in substance, sought an order arresting the judgment of conviction, and reinstated the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff homebuilders association (HA) appealed a judgment of a Georgia trial court, which denied its motion for summary judgment as to attorney fees and expenses of litigation under O.C.G.A. &sect; 13-6-11. The trial court had granted it summary judgment on a claim for return of impact fees against defendant city, which had been assessed against developers for a period of time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city adopted a moratorium on the issuance of development permits pursuant to McDonough, Ga., Ordinance No. 02-27-19. However, it contained an exemption for developers who signed a &quot;moratorium agreement&quot; and paid certain interim fees. The city assessed and collected impact fees for approximately one year. The HA filed its class action against the city, seeking recovery of impact fees that had been assessed against developers for a one-year period based on its claim that the collection thereof was ultra vires. It also sought attorney fees and expenses of litigation. The trial court certified the class under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-23, and then granted summary judgment to the HA on the claim for return of the impact fees. However, the trial court denied summary judgment on the claim for attorney fees and expenses upon finding that the HA failed to provide ante litem notice to the city pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-33-5. On appeal, the court disagreed that the statutory notice was required. As the claims did not involve &quot;injuries to person or property,&quot; &sect; 36-33-5 did not apply. Moreover, &sect; 36-33-5 was to be strictly construed because it was in derogation of the common law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's claim that the trial court erred in allowing a victim's advocate to accompany the first victim to the witness stand and sit by her in front of the jury while she testified also failed. When the first victim took the stand to testify at defendant's trial, the trial court cleared the courtroom of all spectators, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-8-54, with the exception of a victim advocate who accompanied the first victim to the witness stand and sat on the floor next to the first victim while she testified. The trial court carefully observed the advocate's presence and demeanor during the first victim's testimony and saw no inappropriate or prejudicial conduct or behavior. Thus, defendant failed to show the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the advocate to sit with the first victim during her testimony. Finally, the appellate court concluded defendant's waived any claim that the trial court erred in allowing a rebuttal witness to give perjured testimony, by failing to object at trial.</SPAN></P>

The evidence showed that defendant passed the officer in a lane adjacent to the officer while the officer conduced a traffic stop and had his blue emergency lights activated. The officer testified that defendant had room to move out of the adjacent lane and safely into a farther lane. Thus, there was no basis for reversal.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the parking lot lease agreement and its impact upon the church's use of the property, supported the conclusion that the property was real estate rented, leased, or otherwise used for the primary purpose of securing an income thereon, as contemplated by O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-5-41(d)(1). By procuring the land parcel, then converting it into a parking lot, the church increased available off-street, free parking spaces for its parishioners and guests. But the evidence further showed that the church, determined to secure a fixed amount of income, placed its property under contract so that 90 percent of its property would be used by a third-party commercial enterprise approximately 85 percent of the time to compete in the business of public paid parking in a congested area of downtown Atlanta. By doing so, the church deliberately put its property in direct competition with private concerns which were engaged in the same business but enjoy no tax-exemption benefit.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer challenged the validity of the bonds at issued. The court found that the trial court failed to set forth sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its holdings and, therefore, failed to satisfy the requirements of O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-52(a).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The land was historically occupied by a cabin, and in 1979 the prior owner of the land executed a blanket easement in favor of the electric company that he understood to authorize a single electric service distribution line that he requested. In the spring of 2008, the electric company entered the property to construct an upgraded power line at the location of the original distribution line. The appellate court found that the trial court correctly concluded that O.C.G.A. &sect; 46-3-204 would apply to the class member claims. The code plainly stated that &quot;all rights of action&quot; would be barred if they were untimely and grew out of acquisition of easements or the occupying of land. The class was defined to include, owners of land onto which the electric company unlawfully entered to erect structures; thus, the developer and other potential class members could not avoid the code's limiting language by seeking equitable relief in the form of deed reformation, because the code section applied to &quot;all rights of action.&quot; The trial court correctly ruled that the class claims in the amended complaint would not relate back to the timely claims in the original complaint.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been charged by accusation for driving without a valid license and filed the motion to suppress the officer's traffic stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An officer was on patrol when he received a license-plate reader (LPR) system alert of a wanted person.

When the officer approached the vehicle, he asked for defendant's driver's license. Defendant did not have one but, instead, provided the officer with a Mexican identification card. It was discerned that defendant did not match the wanted person, and he was arrested for driving without a license. On appeal, defendant asserted that the officer lacked a reasonable, articulable suspicion to perform the traffic stop and that the LPR system failed to meet foundational requirements for admissibility as established for radar detectors. The court held that based on the alert and information the officer received from the LPR system, the officer had reason to believe that the male driver of the relevant vehicle was wanted, which provided a reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct a traffic stop. The court held that the admissibility of the LRP was not at issue because it was not used to prove commission of the offense at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In two cases consolidated for appeal, plaintiff investor appealed the judgment of a Georgia trial court granting the motion to dismiss filed by defendants, two property companies, and denying the investor's motion for partial summary judgment against defendant businessman. The investor asserted claims for fraud, violations of the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-14-1 et seq., and other claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The businessman was convicted of criminal RICO violations based on the transactions occurring between the parties. On appeal, the investor contended that the trial court erred by granting the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction of the two property companies for not being served with the summons and complaint. The two property companies were served via an agent, the businessman. The court agreed with the investor, finding that the trial court erred in rejecting the investor's evidence of a settlement proposal between herself and the two property companies since the settlement proposal was not prohibited by O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-37 as it was being offered to show an agency relationship between the two property companies and the businessman. The court also agreed with the investor that the trial court erred in denying her motion for partial summary judgment as to the businessman's liability on the investor's civil RICO claim against him because his criminal conviction estopped him from contesting his civil liability pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-14-6(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment, in part, in one case as to the motion to dismiss filed by the two property companies and reversed, in part, the denial of the investor's motion for partial summary judgment in the second case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A patient and a family member filed a medical malpractice action against defendants, a doctor and others. Defendants moved for summary judgment on the basis that the suit was governed by O.C.G.A. &sect; 51-1-29.5(c). The trial court (Georgia) granted defendants' motion. The patient and the family member appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient and his family member contended that O.C.G.A. &sect; 51-1-29.5 was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court concluded that the constitutionality challenge was not preserved for review. The patient and his family member also argued that the trial court erred in concluding that the statute insulated defendants from liability and that, even if &sect; 51-1-29.5 applied, there were still issues of fact as to defendants' liability, the doctor's breach of her fiduciary duty to the patient, and whether defendants' acted in bad faith. The appellate court agreed that the evidence presented factual questions as to whether &sect; 51-1-29.5(c) applied. The evidence showed that the patient's prognosis worsened with the delay. The mere fact that the patient remained in the emergency department while defendants allegedly delayed in providing the requisite care did not automatically invoke application of &sect; 51-1-29.5(c). Although the evidence reflected that the patient presented to the emergency room with an emergency condition, a question of fact existed as to whether defendants' actions in delaying necessary treatment constituted emergency medical care under &sect; 51-1-29.5(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant school district appealed the denial of its motion to dismiss the complaint of appellees, teachers, asserting claims against the district and others for declaratory judgment, money had and received, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, conversion, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district suspended its contributions to a tax-sheltered annuity plan, which the teachers alleged was an employee-benefit plan established by the district as an alternative to the federal Social Security system. The teachers sued the district, the a county board of education, and the members of the board and the district superintendent in their official capacities. The appellate court found that defendants were entitled to sovereign immunity. An allegation that the state violated the teachers' constitutional rights was, not, in itself, sufficient to avoid the state's sovereign immunity. The teachers did not identify a specific waiver of sovereign immunity for the claims of money had and received, unjust enrichment, promissory estoppel, and conversion. Consistent with statutes and ordinances establishing retirement benefits for other government employees, the legislative acts of the board establishing a retirement plan for the district employees could become part of the employees' contract of employment. As such, the teachers could possibly introduce evidence within the framework of the complaint sufficient to warrant a grant of relief for breach of a written contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officer argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion of the &sect; 1983 claim, because he was entitled to qualified immunity. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity because he was never threatened with a weapon and did not have probable cause to believe that the man running away had committed a crime involving serious physical harm. The officer never saw a weapon and the victim never fired a shot or ever threatened the officer. For the same reasons, the appellate court held that the officer was not entitled to official immunity. The county also challenged the trial court's denial of its motion for summary judgment. The appellate court agreed that the trial court erred in denying the county's motion. The trial court erred in finding that prior incidents were sufficient to show that the county failed to train its officers to such an extent that it amounted to deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of persons with whom the police came into contact. Among other things, there was evidence that of the fatal shootings that occurred in the same year, all were justified except the shooting at issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During discovery, counsel defendants requested that the children permit them to conduct ex parte interviews with the decedent's treating health care providers, asking them to either sign a form that complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or agree to a consent order to allow such interviews, but the children refused the request. On appeal, defendants argued that the denial of the motion for a QPO and their motion in the alternative violated their constitutional rights to equal protection and due process. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendants failed to support their assertions that the ex parte interviews were necessary for them to obtain affidavits or medical narratives from the healthcare providers or to protect their work product. Nor did they show why they needed to meet with the healthcare providers ex parte to &quot;prepare&quot; them for trial testimony, as the providers were not parties, were not defendants' expert witnesses, were not agents or employees of defendants, were in a confidential patient-physician relationship with the decedent, and had an ongoing fiduciary duty to the decedent to protect that confidential information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a motel, an assailant, and others, challenged the judgment of a Georgia trial court, which granted partial summary judgment to appellee parents and held that the apportionment of fault statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 51-12-33, did not apply in the case. Appellees brought a wrongful death suit against appellants after appellees' decedent was killed while a guest at the motel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees' decedent was on a business trip and staying at the motel. He met two of his killers earlier in the day. The pair joined with another person to rob the decedent during which he was shot and killed. The motel filed a notice of fault of non-parties, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 51-12-33. In ruling on appellees' motion for partial summary judgment, the trial court held that the statute did not apply, concluding that apportioning fault to the assailant as a contributing non-party in the circumstances would be an incompatible result under Georgia law. Specifically, the trial court concluded that a premises liability action was similar to claims of vicarious or derivative liability. The court found error, concluding that the actions of a criminal assailant are wholly separate from any action or inaction of a property owner and there is no respondeat superior. As such, the trial court erred in failing to apply the apportionment statute.</SPAN></P>

The debtor and guarantors moved to transfer venue. It challenged a judgment of the Lowndes County Superior Court (Georgia), which transferred the matter to Glynn County under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-10-31.1 based on the forum selection clause in the amended and restated promissory note.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The band entered into a loan agreement with the debtor, which executed a promissory note.

The protocols stated that the parties would not bring any action in any forum other than Lowndes County, Georgia. The bank and debtor executed the amended and restated promissory note, which stated that any action could be brought in any state. The court of appeals held that the trial court's focus solely on the amended and restated promissory note and its venue clause was in contradiction of O.C.G.A. &sect; 13-2-2(4). The promissory note was a loan document subject to the document protocols. The venue clause in the note was not inconsistent with that in the document protocols. All of the loan documents were subject to the protocols, and Lowndes County was the agreed upon venue for any suit other than a foreclosure proceeding. No showing was contained in the record that the forum selection clause in the document protocols was unenforceable. Therefore, it was error for the trial court to rule it unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A district attorney initiated forfeiture proceedings against appellees, owners and operators of fuel plazas, under the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, O.C.G.A. 16-14-1. Appellees, the owners' former customers, intervened. They challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Camden County, Georgia, which denied their motion to vacate any order that had been entered after an owner's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The customers argued that the trial court erred by determining that they lacked standing to contest the settlement agreement the deceased owner's daughters entered into with the State and the order of partial distribution. The trial court did not err by finding that the customers lacked standing to participate in the State's decision making process or negotiations concerning which property would be forfeited. Pursuant to RICO, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-4-7, it was the State, and only the State, acting through the appropriate district attorney, that had the right to institute and prosecute forfeiture proceedings, and the property was specifically forfeited to the State, not to the injured or aggrieved person or persons. The trial court did not err by refusing to allow class action plaintiffs in a federal suit to intervene as a class because at the time the intervention order was entered, the customers had not been certified as a class in the federal class action or any other case. Thus, the customers had not been allowed to intervene as a class by the original judge in the forfeiture proceedings. They never sought a separate class certification under state law in the forfeiture proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence, fleeing a police officer, excessive window tinting, and speeding following a traffic stop that was based on his driving a vehicle with excessive window tinting. He  challenged a judgment of the Gwinnett State Court (Georgia), which denied his motion to suppress after finding that the excessive-window-tinting statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-8-73.1(b), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that because the trial court ruled that O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-8-73.1(b) was unconstitutional, it erred in finding that the police officer's belief that defendant's vehicle violated the statute justified the second-tier traffic stop. The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress. The officer had a reasonable articulable suspicion to justify the traffic stop. The officer observed that defendant's vehicle had darkly tinted windows and reasonably believed that to be in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-8-73.1. The fact that the statute was later found to be unconstitutional did not render the stop invalid. The trial court did not err in concluding that the encounter was a proper second-tier stop. Instead of stopping his vehicle when the officer activated his own vehicle's blue lights, defendant sped up and did not stop until he had pulled into the driveway of his residence. Faced with a suspect who appeared to be fleeing from him in a vehicle into which he could not see, the officer drew his weapon, ordered defendant to show his hands, and then briefly handcuffed him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the custody dispute arose, the child was being raised by the grandparents after having been abandoned by the father. The trial court found that the child's primary psychological bond was with the grandparents, that she would suffer significant, long-term emotional harm if custody were returned to the mother, and that an award of custody to the grandparents would best promote the child's health, welfare, and happiness. The appellate court found, inter alia, that pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-7-1(b.1), the trial court found that the presumption in favor of granting custody to the mother had been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence and that the child's best interests would be better served by awarding custody to the grandparents. Therefore, the trial court applied the correct legal standard. In addition, the trial court did not err in permitting the grandparents to intervene under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-24(a)(2). Consequently, the mother was not entitled to appellate relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a complaint for forfeiture of currency, personal property, and vehicles seized by a county sheriff's office. Appellant owners challenged judgments of the Clayton County Superior Court (Georgia), which granted the State's motion to strike their answer on the ground that it failed to comply with the special pleading requirements of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-49(o)(3) and granted the State's petition for a judgment of forfeiture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err by dismissing appellants' claims as to some items because the entries did not contain sufficient information to satisfy the pleading requirement under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-49(o)(3)(D). For those entries there was a blank or no information describing appellants' property interest, and certain additional items were listed with only vague information. However, for other items, appellants' ownership interest was described with the name of the transferor and a year of purchase by appellants. The information was sufficient to plead an interest in the property under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-49(o)(3)(D), and the trial court erred by striking appellants' answer as to those items. Because the forfeiture statute declared as contraband property that was, directly or indirectly, used or intended for use in any manner to facilitate a drug violation, the complaint made out a prima facie case for civil forfeiture of the property as contraband. The State's complaint alleged that items were seized in an investigation involving the conspiracy to traffic cocaine and marijuana, which were violations of the Georgia Controlled Substances Act.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the officer was not discharging his duty when he detained defendant without reasonable suspicion.

Gwinnett County Superior Court judges issued the  wiretaps under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-11-64.

The court of appeals held that the trial court properly denied defendants' motions to suppress the evidence obtained from the wiretaps. O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-11-64(c) authorized Gwinnett County Superior Court judges, who had jurisdiction over the crimes being investigated, to issue wiretap warrants for interceptions occurring outside of Gwinnett County.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two defendants were each convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit theft by receiving stolen property, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-4-8 and 16-8-7, and twelve counts of theft by receiving stolen property, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-8-7(a). Each defendant filed motions for new trial, which were denied by the trial court (Georgia). Both defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">With regard to the first defendant, the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions and he was not denied effective assistance of counsel. However, the trial court failed to enter express findings on the record as to whether the probative value of a 1981 bail-jumping conviction substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect. If on remand, the trial court determined that the prior conviction was inadmissible after engaging in the balancing test required under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-9-84.1(b), then a new trial was required. But, if the trial court determined that the prior conviction was admissible, a new trial was not mandated, subject to appellate review for an abuse of discretion. With regard to the second defendant, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of his prior arrest as similar transaction evidence where the evidence was admissible for the purpose of showing a common scheme or plan, or a modus operandi; there was sufficient evidence to find that the second defendant was the person who committed the act; and there was sufficient similarity between the prior arrest and the crimes charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first defendant's convictions were affirmed on condition, and the case was remanded with direction to the trial court to enter express findings on the record as to whether, in interest of justice, the probative value of his bail-jumping conviction substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect. The court affirmed the second defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was from Mexico and at trial he produced a non-translated Mexican driver's license. He argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-20, which required all non-exempted drivers to have a valid driver's license, violated the U. S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause because it conflicted with the 1943 Convention on the Regulation of Inter-American Automotive Traffic, an international treaty establishing certain foreign drivers' rights to drive in the signatory countries without obtaining a local license. The court held that defendant's conduct fell outside the scope of that protected by the Convention, so no conflict was presented between the Georgia licensing statute and conduct authorized by the Convention. He did not comply with the Convention, which required that he obtain an international driver's license as required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-21(a)(2) and required that the license he produced show on its face that it was valid and authorized him to drive the type or class of vehicle being driven.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The General Assembly did not fund a ten percent pay increase to which the teachers claimed they were entitled. In its motion to dismiss, the State argued that the teachers' claims were not proper remedies against the State, superintendent, and Department because the contracts between the teachers and their employers, the local school boards, would determine whether the employer was required to pay the ten percent salary increase. The trial court granted the motion on the grounds that the State, superintendent, and Department were not the proper parties to the case. The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in granting the State's motion to dismiss the complaint. The trial court correctly ruled that any claim the teachers could have of entitlement to the salary increase had to be brought under their contracts with their employers, the local school boards. The teachers' claims were against their local school boards because the contracts were between the teachers and the local boards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was defendant's adoptive sister. The court of appeals held that the trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion to quash the count of the indictment charging him with incest. Defendant did not commit incest because his adoptive sister was not a whole blood or half blood sibling. The incest statute did not prohibit sexual intercourse between a brother and his adoptive sister not related by blood. The trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion to quash the count of the indictment charging him with exploitation of a disabled adult because the legislature did not intend for O.C.G.A. &sect; 30-5-8(a) to apply to sexual acts such as that alleged in the indictment. The legislature intended for O.C.G.A. &sect; 30-5-8 to apply only to specifically defined non-sexual acts, and it gradually increased the penalties for those non-sexual acts in response to a perceived need to protect disabled persons from &quot;abuse,&quot; &quot;neglect,&quot; and &quot;exploitation&quot; as defined by the Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 30-5-3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that review of defendant's convictions was not proper because defendant had not filed an extraordinary motion for new trial, a petition for habeas corpus, or a motion in arrest of judgment.

Because his life sentence for armed robbery was within the statutory limits, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-8-41(b) (1985), the court had no basis to disturb it.

It argued that O.C.G.A. &sect; 6-3-21 was unconstitutional. The lessee sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Clayton County (Georgia), which granted the county's motion to dismiss on the ground that the lessee's claims were barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessee rented property at an airport. The trial court found that it had resolved the issue of the county's right to tax the lessee's usufruct interest in previous litigation between the parties concerning a different tax year. The lessee argued that in the previous litigation, the trial court did not decide on the merits whether O.C.G.A. &sect; 6-3-21 was constitutional and, therefore, litigation of that issue was not precluded in the case at bar. The court of appeals held that because, in the previous litigation, the trial court only decided that O.C.G.A. &sect; 6-3-21 applied to the lessee's interest and did not decide on the merits whether the statute was constitutional, the lessee was not precluded from litigating the constitutionality issue in the case at bar. Absent a waiver of any procedural bar by the county, untimeliness was the basis of the trial court's ruling on the lessee's constitutionality argument. In the prior action, the trial court's comment hypothetically on whether the lessee's argument would have had merit &quot;if&quot; it had been timely raised could only be construed as obiter dictum and not a ruling on the merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A victim and his family were in a movie theater parking lot when a truck stopped near them.

On appeal, the court found no error in the type of sanctions imposed against defendants for their failure to comply with the EA's discovery requests for a video recording that depicted views of the parking lot at the time of the incident. The EA waived the argument under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-4-22 that the trial court erred by allowing defendants to present evidence that contradicted their version of events.

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was serving time in a residential treatment center pursuant to a sentence from drug court. His mother became concerned that he was having violent thoughts and took him to a mental health evaluation facility. At the intake interview, defendant made numerous threats, causing the interviewer to ask another person to sit in with her. He threatened the sentencing judge with choking and a rifle. He also threatened the director of the treatment center where he was living, as well as the house itself. After being told he would be hospitalized, he called the treatment center director and threatened him directly. The court held that the purpose of defendant's threats against the judge was for diagnosis and treatment at a mental health facility and not for the purpose of terrorizing the judge. The State failed to meet its burden to show that defendant made the threats with the intent to hinder, delay, prevent, or dissuade her from attending a judicial proceeding. His direct threat to the treatment center director and house, however, supported his convictions on those two counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment as to the threats made against the sentencing judge and affirmed the convictions as to the threats made to the treatment center and its director.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A marketer challenged a judgment of the superior court (Georgia), which affirmed the decision of the Georgia Public Service Commission to temporarily divert discretionary funds from a universal service fund to an electing distribution company and marketers to the extent of sixty percent of the shortfall of a natural gas limited liability company (LLC) that filed for bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The LLC filed for bankruptcy when it had supplied less gas than its customers consumed and thus, had sold gas to its customers that it had not tendered to the company. The company filed with the Commission a petition to recover the LLC's shortfall. It requested that certain penalties assessed against marketers and certain profit-sharing monies be redirected from the universal service fund to resolve the shortfall recovery issue by paying the marketers for the LLC's outstanding shortfall. The court of appeals held that the application of the true up process to the shortfall caused by the LLC's bankruptcy did not violate the takings clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V or Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; III, para. I. After the true up process had operated as intended, and after the fact, the marketer sought to obtain from the government amounts representing its commercial losses on gas delivered to the LLC's customers. That was merely a &quot;consequential&quot; loss to the marketer. Some evidence supported the superior court's conclusion that the Commission's decision to allocate a portion of the universal service fund to the shortfall was a regulatory business issue and a question of regulatory policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city filed a declaratory judgment in the Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia), claiming that it had the right to tax businesses operating in an airport that was within the limits of a second city. The second city counterclaimed, arguing that under OCGA &sect; 48-13-6 it was the proper authority for the assessment and collection of occupation taxes. Both cities appealed orders granting and denying their motions for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals held that the first city lacked authority to collect an occupation tax on professional or business activities within the second city's limits. The first city did not identify any constitutional provision or general law that authorized it to levy, assess, and collect an occupation tax on businesses and practitioners that were not located in its limits. To the extent an agreement between the parties purported to vest in the first city the authority to collect an occupation tax on businesses located within the second cit's limits, the contract was unenforceable. Atlanta, Ga., Charter, &sect; 7-105(f) was ineffective to the extent it purported to divest the second city of the authority to levy, assess, and collect an occupation tax on those businesses and practitioners operating at the airport. Only the second city was authorized to levy, assess, and collect an occupation tax from businesses and practitioners at the airport to the extent consistent with Ga. Const. art. IX, &sect; IV, para. I, O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-13-6(b), and its own charter, ordinances, and regulations. There was no showing that the second city granted an exemption from the tax to airport businesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals affirmed the order granting the second city partial summary judgment, reversed the order granting the first city partial summary judgment, and vacated the declaratory judgment in favor of the second city on its claim that it was authorized to impose and collect taxes on the sale, storage, and distribution of alcoholic beverages at the airport within its city limits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment by the trial court (Georgia) that convicted him under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-4(a)(1) of child molestation; defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to cross-examine the victim's grandmother, in excluding evidence that another child had touched the victim, and by improperly placing defendant's character at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant admitted to a police officer and the victim's mother and grandparents that he had been touching the child inappropriately for approximately six months and became sexually aroused by seeing the child naked after her baths. The appellate court found, inter alia, that there was no evidence of a prior false allegation of sexual abuse made by the child or any other witness. Defendant did not object to the grandmother's evidence when it was offered, did not move in limine to prohibit such evidence, and specifically elicited a second reference to the alleged prior assault. Evidence of defendant's character did not go to the ultimate issue in the case. Consequently, because the trial court properly ruled on the admissibility of evidence under O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 24-9-68, 24-2-1, 24-3-16, defendant was properly convicted of child molestation under &sect; 16-6-4(a)(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff parent filed suit against defendants, a school and headmaster, alleging slander and other claims.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parent argued that the offer of settlement was not made in good faith and that, therefore, the trial court should not have awarded attorney's fees and expenses.

Similarly, the fact that the school ultimately incurred $ 84,000 in attorney's fees to defend the parent's claims -- an assertion that the parent did not dispute -- did not preclude a finding of good faith. The court rejected the parent's claims that the 2005 version of the statute applied because she failed to raise them in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A Fulton County trial court (Georgia) entered judgment, upon a jury's verdict, convicting defendant of rape, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-1(a)(1), kidnapping, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-40(a), and false imprisonment, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-41(a). The trial court denied defendant's motion for a new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted fourteen years after the crime took place. He argued that his prosecution was barred by the applicable statutes of limitations, which was four years of kidnapping and false imprisonment and seven years for rape. Defendant further claimed that any change in the law increasing or eliminating the limitation period for rape did not apply retroactively. However, the argument was immaterial to the analysis given that, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-3-2(2), the limitation periods were tolled because defendant's identity as the perpetrator was not known either to the victim or to the State until just before the indictment was issued. Further, evidence was sufficient to prove the element of asportation and to support defendant's kidnapping conviction because he snatched the victim from the sidewalk, forced her across a parking lot and up a flight of stairs to a secluded deck where she could not be seen, and then raped her. Although the duration of the movement was relatively short, and the movement facilitated the rape, the movement did not constitute an inherent part of that rape. Defendant's movement of the victim substantially isolated her from protection or rescue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the drug and weapon evidence, confiscated during a search of the vehicle in which he had been traveling as a passenger. The stop occurred after an officer observed the vehicle make a turn without signaling. Defendant maintained that the search stemmed from an unconstitutional traffic stop and therefore the cited evidence constituted fruit of the poisonous tree. The appellate court found no error, concluding that the record authorized the trial court's conclusion that the traffic stop was supported by probable cause that the driver had committed the traffic offense of failure to use a turn signal. While the State failed to adduce direct evidence showing, at the moment the vehicle was at the subdivision's exit, the precise location of the cars that were later stopped in front of or behind the vehicle at the next intersection, a reasonable inference arose from the officer's testimony that the cars stopped at the stop sign with the vehicle had exited the nearby driveway at a time such that the driver of the vehicle defendant was riding in was required to signal his intent to turn.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was previously arrested for drug and other offenses. She was released from custody when she posted a bond. While free on bond, the sheriff's office was advised that defendant was selling crack cocaine out of her home. Thereafter, various law enforcement officials conducted a warrantless search of defendant's residence pursuant to the conditions of defendant's bond. Defendant was uncooperative, but after she was physically removed from the residence, officers discovered a large quantity of crack cocaine and a handgun in the back master bedroom. Defendant was arrested and charged. Her suppression motion, based on an alleged violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV, was denied. Defendant was convicted after a jury trial. On appeal, the court found that denial of suppression was proper. The evidence supported a finding that defendant freely and voluntarily consented to the special condition of her bond, based on consideration of the contemporaneous documents of the special conditions form and the bond order pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-6-3(a). Based on the consent in the special conditions form, defendant was deemed to have waived her Fourth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A mother appealed an order of a Georgia juvenile court, which granted the request of a county social service agency and terminated her parental rights over her child pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-11-94(b)(4)(A)(iii) and (iv). The juvenile court had found that the child's state of deprivation was likely to continue and that any continued deprivation would like cause serious harm to the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on allegations that the mother, who was homeless, had used cocaine during her pregnancy and to induce labor, and that both the mother and child tested positive for cocaine at the child's birth, a deprivation petition was filed. After a hearing, wherein the mother stipulated to a finding of deprivation, the agency was awarded custody. The juvenile court adopted the agency's case plan. During several status hearings, it was found that the mother had not made much, if any, progress with the case plan requirements. Although the mother had periods of being drug-free and having housing and employment, she failed to maintain those conditions. The agency sought termination, which was granted. On appeal, the court found sufficient clear and convincing evidence to support the termination decision. It noted that there was extensive testimony concerning the mother's positive relationship with her child. It was undisputed that the child's deprivation was caused by the mother's lack of proper parental care or control. Further, the evidence supported the determination that termination was in the child's best interest, based on the need for a secure and stable home.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The PO rented its commercial property to a tenant. Although the tenant was responsible for maintaining and paying for water service from the city, it abandoned the premises and left a large outstanding bill. Thereafter, the PO leased the property to a new commercial tenant. However, the city refused to provide water service to the property until the former tenant's account was paid in full or an agreement for payment was arranged. The new tenant refused to pay the PO rent until water service was obtained. Consequently, the PO paid the arrearage due, and then it filed suit, alleging that the city's refusal to supply water service was unlawful. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city and denied the PO's summary judgment motion. On appeal, the court agreed with the summary judgment ruling. It found that &sect; 36-60-17(a) only prohibited a refusal to supply water service to certain single or multifamily residential property. There was no limitation on non-residential property. Further, the inverse condemnation claim under U. S. Const. amend. V failed, as the city did not force the PO to bear a public burden which should have been borne by the public as a whole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the trial court (Georgia), which convicted him of theft by shoplifting. He argued that the trial court erred in admitting his prior conviction for burglary, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-7-1(a), as impeachment evidence under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-9-84.1 and in refusing to give his requested jury charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals held that defendant failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting his prior conviction. Defendant's credibility as to his intent was highly relevant to the jury's decision. Observing that both the charged offense and the burglary offense for which defendant was previously convicted involved intent to commit a theft, the trial court found that defendant's burglary conviction had sufficient probative value for the purpose of impeachment on whether defendant intended to commit the charged theft and that the probative value of the burglary conviction substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect. The trial court's failure to give defendant's requested charge provided no basis for reversal. The final charge as a whole substantially covered the principles expressed in defendant's requested charge. The trial court instructed the jury that it was the exclude judge of the credibility of witnesses. It also instructed the jury that for a conviction to be warranted based upon circumstantial evidence, the facts proven had to not only be consistent with the theory of guilt but had to exclude every reasonable theory other than guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother and the child's father were divorced before the child was born. The mother married the stepfather.

The mother and stepfather moved to dismiss the grandparents' petition because of the adoption and the father's surrender of his parental rights. They argued that the petition was not authorized because they were the legal parents and lived together with the child. The court of appeals held that the trial court erred by interpreting the word &quot;parent&quot; in O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-7-3(b) to include only biological parents. Therefore, the grandparents' petition was not authorized. The limiting language of O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-7-3(b), which forbade original actions for grandparent visitation if the parents were together and living with the child, included adoptive parents. In the absence of language limiting the term &quot;parent&quot; to only &quot;natural parents&quot; or &quot;biological parents,&quot; there was no legislative intent to withhold from adoptive parents the same constitutionally protected status enjoyed by biological parents to raise their children without state interference.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeal concerned a now-dissolved interlocutory injunction enforcing restrictive covenants against appellant employee and for appellee ex-employer. After the Georgia trial court issued the injunction and docketed the employee's appeal, the ex-employer amended its complaint to dismiss its injunctive relief claim. The trial court dismissed the claim with prejudice and dissolved the injunction. The ex-employer moved to dismiss the appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court found that the trial court granted the employee leave to amend his answer to include a claim for wrongful restraint, which remained pending below. Thus, the appellate court had to decide whether the restrictive covenant actually enforced against the employee was illegal. If it was, then the employee's wrongful restraint claim was meritorious, and he could recover such costs and damages, O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-65(c), as he may have suffered during the period of the injunction's enforcement. Therefore, the ex-employer's motion to dismiss the appeal as moot was denied. The appellate court further held that the injunction enforcing restrictive covenants against the employee amounted to a wrongful restraint under Ga. Const. art. III, &sect; VI, para. V(c) since the non-disclosure provisions in the agreement were unenforceable on their face because they were not limited in time, and Georgia law was clear that if one covenant in an agreement subject to strict scrutiny was unenforceable, then they were all unenforceable. Therefore, the case was remanded for a determination of the amount of actual damages suffered by the employee during the period of the injunction's enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeal was not moot and the injunction amounted to a wrongful restraint. The case was remanded for further proceedings as to any damages suffered by Cox during the pendency of the injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the trial court (Georgia), which convicted him of aggravated stalking, O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-91(a). He argued that it was error to deny his motion for new trial since his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to secure the attendance of a witness and his motion for continuance did not comply with O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-8-25, and the trial court's jury charge on aggravated stalking was unconstitutionally burden-shifting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for new trial. Defendant did not show that his trial counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional judgment in failing to secure the attendance of a witness. Counsel had already announced ready for trial based on defendant's assurance that no witness would come forward for the State, and defendant did not inform counsel of the witness's existence until the eve of trial. Counsel immediately proceeded to interview the witness but did not have sufficient time to procure and serve a subpoena before trial the next day. Defendant could not demonstrate that his defense was prejudiced by counsel's failure to secure the witness's attendance at trial because the witness did not testify at the new trial hearing, and no substitute was offered for her testimony. As the witness had not been subpoenaed, counsel could not comply with O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-8-25. Because defendant failed to object to the trial court's jury charge on aggravated stalking or reserve exceptions to the charge, he waived the claim for appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A grand jury indicted defendant for false imprisonment, aggravated assault, and pointing a gun at another. Defendant filed a motion to quash the indictment and a plea in abatement, arguing that a jury commissioner and the clerk of the board of jury commissioners failed to take the proper oaths under O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 15-12-22 and 15-12-23.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals held that the oath subscribed to the jury commissioner did not comply with O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-12-22 and was not a proper oath, but the commissioner's official acts were valid. While the oath subscribed to by the clerk of the board of jury commissioners did not meet the requirements of O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-12-23 and was not a proper oath, the official acts of the jury commissioners were nonetheless valid. Defendant did not show that, as a result of improper oaths, the jury commissioners failed to properly enter into their duties or to follow statutory guidelines in selecting the jury lists. Thus, the error in the clerk's oath was harmless. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash the indictment based on the racial composition of the grand jury list. An absolute disparity of less than five percent was almost always constitutional. The absolute disparity in over-representation on the grand jury list of 6.429 percent of African-Americans fell within a range that generally met constitutional requirements. Defendant did not meet has not met his burden of showing that the disparity violated the Fourteenth or Sixth Amendment or O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-12-40.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to obtain a DVD recording of her statement to the police and that he did not adequately prepare for trial because he did not view the DVD beforehand. The court of appeals held that defendant failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Assuming that trial counsel's failure to obtain and review the actual recording of defendant's statement to the police constituted deficient performance, defendant did not show that she was prejudiced thereby. Trial counsel testified that he cross-examined the officer who took defendant's statement based on notes from his discussions with defendant, his investigator, the officer's report, and the officer's direct testimony. Trial counsel was not effective for failing to file a pre-trial motion to suppress evidence of defendant's statement to the police based on a violation of Miranda because defendant made no showing that such a motion would have been successful. Defendant's punishment was not so severe or excessive in proportion to the offense as to shock the conscience. Although defendant was only thirteen years old, she participated in the armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, the victims' uncle, supervised the two girls, ages 7 and 9, while their mother worked. Both girls testified that defendant touched them inappropriately on multiple occasions. One victim testified that she felt sad about defendant and that defendant made her feel uncomfortable when he touched her. The victims' mother testified that during the time defendant watched the girls, one girl's grades dropped, she would not pay attention in school, and started stealing in school. She also became aggressive with her sister during this time. This evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding that defendant's acts caused the girls cruel and excessive mental pain for purposes of the child cruelty statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-70(b). Defendant acknowledged that he was an authority figure to the girls and that they loved and trusted him. Malice could be inferred from these facts because the girls were children, relatively powerless, who depended upon defendant. The court rejected defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel's spending only five hours on the case prior to trial.</SPAN></P>

The company won a defense verdict and filed a motion pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-68 to recover the attorney fees and expenses of litigation it incurred after the husband and wife rejected its settlement offer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company argued that the trial court erred in failing to enforce &sect; 9-11-68.

The court of appeals held that the trial court did not err in denying the company's motion for attorney fees and expenses of litigation because &sect; 9-11-68 was inapplicable. Because &sect; 9-11-68(b) operated as a substantive law, and it was not yet in effect in 2004 when the substantive rights of the husband and wife became fixed, they were entitled to seek compensation in tort from the company, free from any duty and obligation to pay its attorney fees if they failed to obtain a final judgment that was at least seventy-five percent of any offer of settlement. The substantive rights of the parties in a negligence case were fixed at the time of the injury or event on which liability depended. Because &sect; 9-11-68 did not reach back to the date the husband and wife filed suit, it was illogical to maintain that the company's right to fees and expenses would accrue on that date.</SPAN></P>

The charge was not voluntary because it was exacted pursuant to the Act and the county resolution. The purpose of the charge was to fund, i.e., raise revenue, for the 9-1-1 system, not as compensation for the service rendered by it. Those who paid the 9-1-1 charge received no benefit not received by the general public because all members of the public could access the 9-1-1 system.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city resident filed an action seeking to enjoin a city from acting on an annexation of two tracts of land. He argued that the annexation was ultra vires because it created an unincorporated island completely surrounded by the city in violation of the Zoning Procedures Law, O.C.G.A. &sect; 36-36-4. The resident challenged an order of the trial court (Georgia), which granted summary judgment in favor of the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city annexed and rezoned the two tracts of land. That annexation left one tract of land entirely surrounded by the city. The city later annexed that tract. The trial court ruled that the resident's case was mooted by the second annexation. The court of appeals held that the original tract of land was not a preexisting unincorporated island. Therefore, the first annexation created an unincorporated island, which was prohibited by &sect; 36-36-4(a). The first annexation left the two tracts of land entirely surrounded by city, and that annexation violated &sect; 36-36-4(a)(1). Because the first annexation violated a State statute, it exceeded the city's power. Therefore, it was ultra vires and void. Accordingly, the first annexation ordinance was void. Although the second annexation purportedly eliminated the incorporated island, it did not make moot the question of whether the first annexation was void. The resident's claim was not moot because what he sought was injunctive relief prohibiting the city from acting on the annexation, such as expending city funds on the newly incorporated area. He was not seeking to enjoin the annexation of the two tracts of land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the case for entry of summary judgment in favor of the resident, together with an injunction against the city for any actions flowing from the void annexation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the trial court (Georgia) of trafficking in cocaine in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-31(a)(1). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the alleged cocaine into evidence because the traffic stop, ostensibly based on a tag violation, was not based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, and that the search of his person was not based on consent or probable cause. Defendant failed to file a written motion to suppress the evidence. The court held that insofar as defendant's oral objection at trial on Fourth Amendment grounds could be considered a motion to suppress evidence, it was improper because it was not made in writing as required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-5-30. When the trial court referred to Exhibit 1 as &quot;the cocaine,&quot; defense counsel sought a mistrial on the grounds that the trial court had expressed an opinion on the evidence, contrary to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-8-57. The court held that the fact that the item seized was cocaine was not contradicted, and defendant himself referred to the substance as cocaine. Therefore, the trial court's comment was not error, and any error was cured by an instruction to the jury that whether or not the substance was cocaine was for the jury to determine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury in the trial court (Georgia) found defendant guilty of armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated assault, criminal attempt to commit aggravated sodomy, and obstruction of a law enforcement officer. Defendant appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the kidnapping charge and certain rulings by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence showed that defendant approached one victim, a 13-year-old boy, in a park and asked for money; he then followed him home, put a gun in his back, and forced him into his house, where he demanded money from the boy's mother, then exposed himself, and attempted to force the mother's head toward his groin. The court held that sufficient movement occurred to sustain the asportation requirement of the kidnapping charge when defendant forced the boy from the backyard into the house. Although the movement did not last long, it was not incidental to another criminal offense. The movement from the relatively open backyard into the house placed the boy in additional danger by isolating him from rescue and exercising further control over him. One-on-one showups conducted by police were not impermissibly suggestive because the victims were able to see defendant clearly, defendant matched their descriptions, and the show-ups occurred within 45 minutes of the crimes. Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-7(b), defendant was subject to a maximum sentence of ten years for the sodomy attempt. Therefore, his 30-year sentence was required to be vacated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's judgments of conviction but vacated his sentence on the attempt to commit aggravated sodomy charge and remanded the case with direction to resentence defendant on that charge.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed pro se, alleging among other things that the ordinance was unconstitutional and that the evidence was insufficient to convict him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An housing code enforcement officer visited defendant's property and observed 50-60 vehicles in the backyard, in various states of disrepair as a result of rust, fire, lack of tires, flat tires, and weeds growing through their fenders or hoods. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the junk vehicle ordinance because defendant failed to secure a ruling from the trial court as to this claim prior to the jury's verdict. The court held, however, that the evidence was insufficient to convict defendant under Dougherty County, Ga., Code &sect; 2-14-74 because defendant cut the vegetation in his backyard within the cure period provided by the ordinance. There was no evidence that defendant's property contained trash or debris following the date of the citation; therefore, the evidence was insufficient to convict under Dougherty County, Ga., Code &sect; 2-14-48 and Dougherty County, Ga., Standard Housing Code &sect; 307.4. Evidence that defendant's vehicles remained in various states of disrepair for several months following his citation was sufficient to convict under Dougherty County, Ga., &sect; 2-8-3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the finding that defendant had violated the junk car ordinance but reversed the findings that he had violated the tall grass ordinance and the trash ordinance.

The trial court (Georgia) dismissed the suit on the ground that the widow's exclusive remedy was under the Workers' Compensation Act. The widow appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The deputy gave chase to the escaped convict in the courthouse; the convict shot the deputy with a gun taken from another deputy, whom he had overpowered. On appeal, the widow argued that the trial court erred in ruling that (1) the sheriff was the deputy's employer for purposes of the Act, and (2) no unique duty was owed to the deputy by his fellow employees that rendered the exclusive remedy provision inapplicable. The court held that the sheriff was an elected county officer under Ga. Const. art. IX, &sect; I, para. III(a), and the Act's definition of &quot;employer&quot; included the State of Georgia and all departments, instrumentalities, and authorities thereof; and each county within the state, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 34-9-1(3). Further, the sheriff was deemed the deputy's employer by virtue of (i) his status as a county officer, and (ii) the Act's treatment of counties as employers. The rule that a professional co-employee charged with fraud, deceit, and violation of professional trust could be held liable in tort for his wrongdoing to an injured co-employee, applied only to cases of professional malpractice in the context of a fiduciary duty and did not apply to the deputy's co-employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court did not err in dismissing the widow's claims on the basis that the Worker's Compensation Act provided her exclusive remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, as administrator of his aunt's estate of his aunt, filed a wrongful death action against defendant transit authority. The transit authority moved for summary judgment, contending that the two-year statute of limitation governing the wrongful death claim had expired. The trial court denied the transit authority's motion for summary judgment, and the transit authority filed an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On April 13, 2005, the deceased aunt was riding in a transit van when it collided with a vehicle. She fell out of her wheelchair and injured her knee. She died on August 23, 2005, allegedly as a result of her injuries. The aunt had no surviving spouse, children, or parents. An earlier suit brought by the nephew individually was dismissed because he did not have standing under O.C.G.A. &sect; 51-4-2(a) to bring a wrongful death action. The nephew then had himself appointed administrator of the aunt's estate and brought a second suit; by this time, the two-year statute of limitations of O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-3-33 had run. The trial court found that O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-3-92 tolled the statute of limitations. The court agreed that the nephew, as administrator of the estate, was authorized to assert the wrongful death action on behalf of the aunt's next of kin. However, because the estate had no interest or concern in the litigation, the tolling provision in O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-3-92 did not apply and could not save the nephew's claim. Collateral estoppel did not preclude this result because, in the earlier action, the trial court's statement that the nephew could bring the action as an administrator was dicta.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's ruling denying the transit authority's motion for summary judgment was reversed and the case remanded with direction that the trial court enter judgment in favor of the transit authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Cherokee County Superior Court (Georgia), which convicted him of failure to register as a sex offender as required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-12. He argued that the State failed to prove that he was required to register as a sex offender because under consensual sodomy was no longer a crime and that his trial counsel was ineffective for not asserting that defense at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of sodomy in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-2. He was charged with failure to register as a sex offender. He contended that because of substantive changes in the law, which legalized consensual sodomy in Georgia, he was not required to register. The court of appeals held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. When defendant was charged with failure to register he was required to register as a sex offender because he had been convicted of criminal sexual conduct toward a minor. The supreme court's ruling that &sect; 16-6-2 infringed upon the right of privacy had to be applied retroactively on collateral review, but the court of appeals could not apply it in defendant's case because it was not on collateral review. The appeal was from a conviction for failure to register as a sex offender, which was a proceeding separate from defendant's original offense. At the time of defendant's sodomy conviction, the conduct in which he engaged was against the law in Georgia. Defendant did not show that there was a reasonable probability that but for counsel's unprofessional errors the result of the proceeding would have been different.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees filed suit against two separate truck drivers, the companies that owned the drivers' trucks, and their insurers seeking recovery for the decedent's death in a vehicular collision. The insurer made an offer of settlement under &sect; 9-11-68, which was rejected. After the jury returned a verdict of no liability as to the insurer, it moved for fees and costs. The trial court denied the motion and did not set forth the basis for its determination. On appeal, the court vacated and remanded the case. Although the settlement offer required the execution of a release, which was not attached to the offer, the court held that the settlement offer met the particularly requirements of &sect; 9-11-68(a)(4). Contrary to appellees' contention, the court also held that under the clear language of &sect; 9-11-68, the insurer's second offer, which was also rejected, did not negate the effect of appellees' rejection of the first offer.  Because the trial court was required by &sect; 9-11-68(d)(2) to set forth the basis for its determination, the court remanded the case for a statement by the trial court as to the basis for its ruling denying the insurer fees and expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted after a bench trial of driving while under the influence of any drug to the extent that it was less safe for him to drive, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-391(a)(2). He was also convicted of driving with a controlled substance in his blood, in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-391(a)(6), although that conviction was merged into his DUI-less safe conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his DUI-less safe conviction, and that O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-391(a)(6) violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. Defendant was arrested following an accident in which he struck a bus that turned in front of him. Although the bus driver was cited for the accident, the responding officer smelled alcohol on defendant and noted that defendant had not tried to avoid striking the bus despite a clear line of sight. Defendant also admitted being at a social function earlier. The State presented evidence that defendant had alprazolam and a cocaine metabolite in his blood. However, there was no evidence tending to explain the significance of these drugs, whether the quantity was sizeable, whether ingestion was recent, or the effect the drugs would have on the average person. Defendant presented testimony that the metabolite was not indicative of impairment because it was the after-effect of cocaine and could be detected in a urine sample for up to 48 hours. Because there was no evidence that defendant was less safe, his conviction was reversed. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 40-6-391(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction for DUI-less safe and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff landowners filed suit against defendants, their neighbors and the State, in superior court, alleging that the neighbors' construction of a dock in a tidal river would interfere with their ownership rights. The State's motion to dismiss was granted. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling as to standing, but the Georgia Supreme Court reversed, leaving the question of the correctness of the dismissal pending in the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners' claims for declaratory judgment and mandamus arose from the Department of Natural Resource's (DNR) denial of their petition for a formal hearing pursuant to DNR rules authorizing such petitions in &quot;contested cases,&quot; and that such a hearing was required under the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act, O.C.G.A. &sect; 12-5-283(b). The court held that the Act explicitly stated that its provisions did not apply to certain private docks built exclusively for the noncommercial use of the owner or his or her invitees, O.C.G.A. &sect; 12-5-295(7), such as the neighbors' planned dock. The owners' takings claims turned on their allegation that their property was diminished in value by DNR's issuance of a license to the neighbors to build a private dock. The court held that such a license was not a taking of the owners' property by the State for public use: the license was granted to a private party for the lawful construction of a private dock. Their equal protection rights were not violated because they were not similarly situated to their neighbors, and there was no showing that they would not have been allowed to build a dock if they chose.</SPAN></P>

The owners challenged an order of the Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia), which denied their motion for class certification pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied certification on the ground that the motion was not accomplished as soon as practicable after the commencement of the suit. The court of appeals held that the trial court did not engage in the required analysis in determining whether the motion had to be denied as untimely or make any factual findings supporting its decision. Section &sect; 9-11-23 placed a shared obligation upon the litigants and the trial court to ensure that the question of class certification was timely resolved. When deciding whether to deny a motion for class certification as untimely, the trial court had to consider the purposes served by &sect; 9-11-23, balancing any actual prejudice to the litigants or the class against any legitimate reasons for the delay. In the absence of a local rule governing the timely filing of a motion for class certification, a trial court could not deny an otherwise proper motion solely on the basis that it was untimely. Rather, it had to determine whether the delay resulted in any actual prejudice to the litigants or to the class. In its order on the motion for class certification, the trial court had to set forth in writing factual findings supporting its decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's sentence included that he obtain sex offender treatment; he received copies of documents listing special conditions of probation and the rules of the intensive probation supervision program. In addition, upon acceptance into a particular treatment program, defendant signed several documents regarding the program's rules and regulations, which specifically stated that he was not allowed to be around minors without an approved supervisor. Defendant demonstrated his understanding of the rules by properly seeking permission to date his girlfriend. However, he did not disclose when his girlfriend and her two minor children moved in with him; the probation revocation was based on the fact that defendant was living with the girlfriend's minor children, one of whom was the same age and gender as the victim in the case for which defendant was serving probation. On appeal, the court found that the treatment guideline was not vague or overly broad as applied to defendant. Regardless of whether the condition could be interpreted in an overly broad manner, it was sufficient to put defendant on notice that he could not reside with minors without supervision and approval.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two defendants were jointly tried by a jury in the trial court (Georgia) and found guilty on 24 counts of a 29-count indictment for armed robberies and related crimes that occurred on October 22, 2005 and November 4, 2005. Following the denial of their respective motions for new trial, defendants appealed, citing several claims of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendants were charged in a home invasion in which one defendant shot a husband who answered the door, then pushed into the house, bound the husband and wife and their six-year-old daughter, removed bags of items from the house, and drove away in the husband's vehicle. The second and third crimes involved the robberies of two restaurants during which defendants threatened a truck driver and restaurant employees before taking items from the restaurants. Defendants first contested their kidnapping convictions, arguing that movement of the various victims during the crimes did not constitute sufficient asportation under O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-40(a). The court considered the movements of all the victims and determined that some, which isolated the victims or enhanced their danger, had sufficient asportation, while two others were incidental to the armed robbery and burglary. Armed robbery counts against each member of the family in the home invasion did not merge. The trial court was required to reconsider whether the search of defendant's truck was unconstitutional in light of Arizona v. Gant, a recently-decided U.S. Supreme Court case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment as to one defendant was reversed in part as to two kidnapping charges and otherwise affirmed. The court vacated the judgment in the second defendant's case and remanded the case for the trial court to conduct a new hearing on the motion to suppress in light of Gant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Four black men wearing gloves and masks over their faces burst into a jewelry store. They smashed the glass showcases, swiping jewelry from them. They dragged an employee 15 feet to the store's locked safe, which she opened. They fled in a Buick, which was found abandoned, and were stopped moments later in a Camry, which an officer headed to the jewelry store had seen speeding away. Defendants argued that the traffic stop was supported by neither probable cause nor articulable suspicion. The court disagreed; the officer had seen the Camry run a stop sign, and its proximity to the abandoned getaway car gave him cause to issue a BOLO (be on the lookout) for the Camry. The Camry stopped had shiny wheels, as did the one the officer had seen. This detailed information provided the officers with the requisite articulable suspicion to stop the Camry. One defendant ran away, abandoning any reasonable expectation of privacy as to the contents of the car. The 15-foot movement of the store employee to the safe did not constitute the necessary asportation to support a kidnapping conviction because it was of minimal duration and was incidental to the armed robbery and aggravated assault crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed all of the convictions, except the court reversed one defendant's conviction for kidnapping with bodily injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of failure to register as a sex offender in violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-12(f)(5) and received a mandatory life sentence under O.C.G.A. &sect; 42-1-12(n)(3) because it was his second conviction. He filed a motion for new trial, asking the trial court (Georgia) to grant his motion for directed verdict, which had been presented during trial. The State challenged the judgment granting the motion for directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals held that the trial court erred in granting the motion for directed verdict after the judgment of conviction had been entered. The trial court's reservation of a ruling upon the motion was entered after the trial court imposed sentencing and entered its judgment of conviction. Therefore, the decision on the motion came too late and was procedurally barred. The trial court's conclusion that the State failed to present any competent evidence showing that defendant had changed his residence was erroneous. In its assessment of the evidence, the trial court erroneously determined that an investigator's testimony amounted to inadmissible hearsay that lacked probative value and could not be considered. The investigator's testimony as to the declaration of defendant's father that defendant no longer lived at his residence was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement and was admissible as substantive evidence of defendant's guilt. The circumstances presented by the evidence would authorize a rational trier of fact to find that defendant had intended to change his residence without notifying the local authorities as required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeals reversed the judgment in part and remanded the case to the trial court for consideration of the remaining issues raised in defendant's motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant based his contention that his sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment on the fact that a 2006 amendment to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-4 made the conduct for which he was convicted a misdemeanor. In Humphrey v. Wilson, a majority of the Supreme Court concluded that a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years in prison with no possibility of parole, as well as registration as a sex offender, constituted cruel and unusual punishment for a 17-year-old defendant convicted of the aggravated child molestation of a 15-year-old victim. The court held that its decision would also apply to similarly situated defendants: those teenagers convicted only of aggravated child molestation, based solely on an act of sodomy, with no injury to the victim, involving a willing teenage partner no more than four years younger than the defendant. The court held that because defendant was a teenager convicted only of aggravated child molestation, based solely on an act of sodomy, with no injury to the victim, involving a teenage partner no more than four years younger than he was, Humphrey required that defendant's sentence be set aside, and he could not be resentenced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to dismiss the proceedings against defendant and discharge him from custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The niece worked for a law firm for three months until she was terminated from employment because of poor performance and because she spent an inordinate amount of time on her personal cell phone. The niece stole the law firms' checks, which contained separate individual check numbers, the firm name, and the firm checking account number, inserted an amount and forged a firm lawyer's signature, and then the aunt recruited other women to cash the checks while the niece intercepted calls from the bank and gave false verification information. Defendants stole, forged, and cashed over twenty checks totaling $ 425,000. The court held that this evidence that defendants accessed the firm's financial resources by using its identifying information was sufficient to support the jury's verdict of guilty on twenty counts of identity fraud under the applicable statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-9-121(2) (2003). Although many of the stolen checks were negotiated outside of DeKalb County, venue in DeKalb County was proper pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-9-125 because defendants accessed the financial information of a victim residing in DeKalb County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Developers filed a declaratory judgment action against a county, contending that it improperly designated a historic district under Georgia's Historic Preservation Act (HPA), O.C.G.A. &sect; 44-10-20 et seq. The DeKalb County Superior Court (Georgia) denied the developers' motion for partial summary judgment and implicitly granted summary judgment to the county on the declaratory judgment claim. The developers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled that as the county &quot;substantially complied&quot; with the HPA, its designation of the historic district was valid. The developers argued that a &quot;strict compliance&quot; standard applied. The appellate court disagreed. As the HPA did not state that a county's failure to strictly comply with its procedures invalidated an ordinance adopted thereunder, and as the developers failed to show they were harmed by the county's alleged failure to strictly comply with the HPA's procedures, the ordinance was valid if the county substantially complied with the HPA. The record supported the trial court's finding that the county substantially complied with the statutory notice requirements when it enacted the ordinance. Though there was no proof that the county's chief executive officer signed the resolution, as there was no evidence the officer vetoed it, the ordinance was valid. As the developers knew when they bought the property that it was subject to the historic district's restrictions on development, they failed to show that they were denied due process or otherwise harmed by any of the claimed notice deficiencies in the county's designation of the historic district.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although defendant signed an affidavit which informed him that he had a right to have his sentence reviewed by a three-judge review panel under former O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-6, that statute was repealed before sentencing. Defendant argued that his counsel was ineffective in failing to inform him of this before sentencing, and testified that had he known that his sentence would not be reviewed, he would not have pled guilty. The appellate court found that the record supported a finding that defendant entered his plea knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Defendant failed to establish that, but for his counsel's failure to inform him of the repeal of former O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-6, he would have insisted on a trial. When defendant decided to enter the plea, he was aware that the State was making no recommendation of sentence and that he had the potential to receive a maximum sentence of 66 years. The availability of a sentence review did not alter the possibility that defendant could have potentially been required to serve up to 66 years in prison. The trial court was not clearly erroneous in its finding that counsel rendered effective assistance in connection with the plea.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found, inter alia, that the evidence was sufficient to find defendant guilty of the charges. Moving the victim from the closet to the dining room and the journey in the car supported the kidnapping conviction. Counsel's strategic decisions did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-5-40(b)(4) did not violate the 8th Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.

The appellate court agreed. Further, sending a text message did not constitute making material available &quot;by electronic storage device&quot; under &sect; 16-12-100.1(a)(3)(A). Therefore, Count One had to be quashed. However, as a text message constituted &quot;printed matter however reproduced&quot; for purposes of &sect; 16-12-103(a)(2), and as a person of ordinary intelligence would have had fair notice that sending a sexually explicit text message to a minor was unlawful under &sect; 16-12-103, defendant's prosecution for distribution of harmful materials to a minor did not violate due process. As a text message was in written format and not capable of being heard, it was not &quot;aural matter&quot; within the meaning of O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-12-100.3(b). Therefore, Count Three, charging defendant with obscene telephone contact with a minor, had to be quashed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's order denying defendant's motion to quash as to Count Two; therefore, the State could proceed with its prosecution of defendant under &sect; 16-12-103. It reversed the trial court's order insofar as it denied defendant's motion to quash as to Counts One and Three (&sect;&sect; 16-12-100.1 and 16-12-100.3, respectively).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges against defendant arose from his sexually inappropriate conduct towards an employee at a daycare center operated by defendant's wife. The employee called her mother to pick her up but did not divulge the incident until later that evening. Police investigators indicated that defendant had admitted to fondling the employee's breasts, and that his answers on polygraph examinations appeared deceptive. Defendant was convicted and sentenced. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-6.1(b)(2)(E), none of the mandatory minimum sentences were to be suspended, probated, or paroled. On appeal, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The challenge to the constitutionality of the sentencing statutes was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Georgia Supreme Court. However, as the challenges were not raised in the trial court level, the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction over the issue. The sentences were deemed proper where they were within statutory limits and legally authorized pursuant to &sect;&sect; 16-6-22.2(c) and 17-10-6.1(b)(2)(E).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer filed suit after a retaining wall designed by the architect failed. The parties' contract limited the architect's liability to the developer for any errors or professional negligence to $ 50,000 or to the amount of the architect's fee, whichever was greater. The trial court held that the limitation provision violated former O.C.G.A. &sect; 13-8-2(b) (2001) and was therefore void as against public policy. The appellate court held that former &sect; 13-8-2(b) applied only to contract provisions purporting to indemnify or hold harmless the promisee against liability for damages; therefore, it did not apply to the contract's limitation of liability provision, which did not purport to indemnify or hold the architect harmless from damages but simply established a bargained-for cap on the liability of the architect to the developer for the architect's breach or negligence. The contract's indemnity provision did not contravene former &sect; 13-8-2(b), as it specifically excluded the architect's sole negligence from the indemnity obligation of the developer. Therefore, the architect was entitled to partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The developer cross-appealed the decision finding that its petition for a declaratory judgment that a challenged ordinance was unconstitutional was moot. The developer had brought the declaratory suit seeking to void the ordinance as unconstitutional. The developer asserted other claims, as well as sought attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The developer had two soil related permit violations, and the county denied its application for a land disturbance permit based on the ordinance at issue, which required denial of any application if two or more violations existed. The developer filed suit, asserting that the ordinance banned it from doing business in the county and violated its equal protection rights. Just before trial began, the county formally rescinded the notice of debarment. On appeal, the county asserted that the developer's federal law claim for damages violated its right to equal protection as the developer was required to prove it was deprived of a valid property right and that no developer could have a vested property interest in land disturbance permits. The court held that the developer was not required to prove a valid property right since it sufficiently alleged it received harsher treatment than others under the ordinance. As to the developer's appeal, the court found that the trial court erred by failing to consider the merits of its petition for a declaratory judgment since the overall enforceability of the ordinance, which was still the law, was not rendered moot by the withdrawal notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the verdict in favor of the developer in the county's appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After her probation officer filed a complaint alleging that defendant, a juvenile, had violated the terms of a prior probation, the juvenile court (Georgia) entered an order adjudicating defendant delinquent, finding that she was in need of treatment or rehabilitation, and committing her to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) for care, supervision, and planning as provided in O.C.G.A. &sect; 49-4A-8. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by committing her to the DJJ. She cited O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-11-67, which permitted a juvenile court to order a DJJ commitment, but only under certain circumstances, and argued that the trial court was not authorized to find those circumstances here. However, the appellate court found that &sect; 15-11-67 applied where the child was found &quot;unruly,&quot; and defendant was adjudicated delinquent, not unruly. Similarly, O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-11-48(e), also cited by defendant, applied to cases involving an unruly child. Defendant was already on probation for a delinquent act when she committed the three acts at issue, which violated terms of her probation. Disobeying such terms constituted a delinquent act, and where a child was found to have committed a delinquent act and was subsequently found in need of treatment or rehabilitation, O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-11-66(a)(4) authorized a disposition best suited to the child's treatment, rehabilitation, and welfare, which included committing the child to the DJJ. Contrary to defendant's contention, her commitment harmonized with the goals set forth in O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-11-1 and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court further found no error with regard to the trial court replacing one juror with the alternate after jury deliberations had begun as that juror sent a note to the trial judge that she had spoken with the victim's parents during voir dire, knew people on each side of the case, and was afraid of potential ramifications from rendering a verdict in the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Teachers Retirement System of Georgia (TRS) appealed a Georgia trial court's grant of summary judgment to a class of retirees who alleged that the TRS incorrectly calculated their monthly retirement pay. After remand from a reversal on appeal of an initial summary judgment by the trial court, the retirees were awarded additional retirement payments, pre- and post-judgment interest, and a counsel fee. The retirees also appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court initially granted summary judgment to the TRS. On appeal, that ruling was reversed and a remand was issued for the trial court to determine the proper limitation period and whether the retirees were entitled to a higher monthly benefit. The trial court determined that the applicable limitations period was 20 years pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-3-22, and that the claims accrued payment by payment instead of only upon the retirement of each individual. The trial court entered money awards to the retirees, and the TRS sought review. On appeal again, the court found that the applicable limitations period was six years for a breach of contract under O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-3-24. Further, each payment constituted a new breach that was actionable under O.C.G.A. &sect; 13-6-14. The trial court's counsel fee determination was not excessive, and it was based on proper consideration of the 12 &quot;Johnson&quot; factors. The trial court should have imposed interest at the statutory rates under O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 7-4-2(a)(1)(A) and 7-4-12(a), as there was no applicable contractual rate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court with respect to the determination that the claims were governed by the 20-year limitation period and with respect to the interest awards, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to the determination that the limitation period ran on each successive breach, and with respect to the fee award.</SPAN></P>

Of significance, since the statute went into effect after defendant entered his plea, his original sentence did not require him to register as a sex offender. The trial court denied defendant's motion. Defendant argued on appeal that the statute requiring his registration should not apply to him and was unconstitutional. The court held that the Supreme Court of the United States had already determined that the statutory requirement for retroactive registration of sex offenders was nonpunitive and did not itself constitute an ex post facto law. The court upheld the trial court's decision that to remove defendant from the registry and resentence him as a first offender would be in direct contravention of the plain language of &sect; 42-1-12 and O.C.G.A. &sect; 17-10-6.1. Since the trial court did not rule on the constitutional issues raised by defendant, those claims were deemed waived.</SPAN></P>

At that point, defendant tried to flee and he was subdued. The baggy was found to have nine rocks of crack cocaine. Money was also found on defendant. At the hearing on defendant's motion to suppress, the trial court accepted the officers' testimony and relied upon a bond order against defendant wherein he agreed to waive his rights under the Fourth Amendment to searches and seizures, including but not limited to random drug screening and to be searched by law enforcement at anytime, anywhere. The court held that the trial court erred by taking judicial notice of the bond order to justify the officers' search of defendant as the officers had no knowledge of the bond order when they undertook the search of defendant's person. The trial court should have conducted a hearing pursuant to case law to determine the validity of defendant's waiver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a bench trial, defendant was convicted of nine counts of sexual assault against a person enrolled in a school (O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-5.1(b)). The Georgia trial court sentenced him to 30 years on each count, 20 years to serve in confinement and 10 years on probation, the sentences to be served concurrently. It denied his motion for a new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had frequent sexual relations with a 17-year-old student enrolled at the school where he taught; none occurred on school property. He argued there was no evidence he had &quot;supervisory authority&quot; over the student, an element of &sect; 16-6-5.1(b). The appellate court disagreed. During the time the sexual encounters took place, the victim was a member of the school's quiz bowl team, of which defendant was faculty advisor. The principal testified that defendant had supervisory authority over the victim while on campus. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions. Despite defendant's contention to the contrary, at the hearing on his request to waive a jury trial, the trial court confirmed that he understood that the minimum sentence for sexual assault was 10 years. Thus, his jury waiver was valid. Defendant's sentence was within statutory limits. Because high school students were vulnerable to sexual assault by teachers, the sentencing range provided by the legislature, and the sentence imposed by the trial court, furthered accepted goals of punishment and deterrence, were not grossly disproportionate, and thus did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the trial court set a hearing on the second driver's motions for new trial and attorney fees, the first driver's attorney requested a continuance of 60 days due to several health issues. The trial court apparently notified counsel's office that the doctor's excuse was not satisfactory without more information about the illness and that the hearing would not be continued. The trial then court held the hearing without the first driver or his counsel and awarded fees and costs to the second driver pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 9-11-68 (2005) and 9-15-14. The appellate court found that because &sect; 9-11-68 became effective during the pendency of the litigation, it could not form the basis of the fee award. Further, the trial court failed to include specific findings of fact to support the award under &sect; 9-15-14. In addition, neither the first driver nor his attorney were not afforded an opportunity to be heard before the sanctions were imposed. Therefore, the trial court erred in awarding the second driver attorney fees and costs of litigation. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 5-6-39(b), the trial court properly dismissed the first driver's notice of appeal from the final judgment as untimely.</SPAN></P>

The court further found no error with regard to the admission of any evidence, including the admission of testimony from defendant's nephew regarding letters defendant sent him asking him to perjure himself. There was no question as to the contents of the letter, therefore, the best evidence rule was not violated.

Appellee, a county Department of Family and Children Services had filed a deprivation petition seeking temporary custody of then nine-year-old child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was adopted by the parents. For six months in 2006, an 11-year-old foster child lived in the home with the child and the parents and had testified that the father touched her privates in various ways too. On appeal, the father argued that there was no clear and convincing evidence that he molested the child or the foster child, particularly because the foster child was not credible and the child denied being molested. However, the court found that it was within the juvenile court's province to judge the credibility of the witnesses and that it was within its province to have found that the child was deprived as to the father. Likewise, evidence that the mother instructed the child to deny any questions regard the abuse and that the father would bring her a kitten if he was allowed back home supported the juvenile court's finding that the child was deprived by the mother. The court further found that the juvenile court properly excluded the testimony of a court-appointed special advocate (CASA) for the purpose of impeaching the foster as such testimony was inconsistent with the CASA program and because the parents had multiple witnesses to impeach the foster child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State also appealed the order granting a new trial on the kidnapping convictions, and the Supreme Court of Georgia vacated and reversed the trial court's rulings and remanded the case. The only issues in this case related to the aggravated assault conviction. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction based on evidence that he and the victim were engaged in mutual combat during the incident at issue. However, the appellate court found that the facts cited by defendant were of no consequence on appeal because the appellate court did not speculate as to which evidence the jury chose to believe. The evidence was sufficient. The victim testified that her right jawbone was broken during the assault. Contrary to defendant's argument, the trial court did not err in permitting this testimony. Defendant also claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to conduct a proper, thorough, and sifting cross-examination of the victim. However, defendant never asserted that trial counsel was ineffective on these grounds in his motion for new trial, amended motion for new trial, or the motion for new trial hearing, and thus waived them on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia) reversed the department's decision and ordered it to remit $ 1,826,333 to the hospital. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hospital argued that it was error for the department to apply a revision to its services manual retroactively to its review of the cost reports at issue. The trial court found that the department's use of the manual revision for prior years was an unconstitutional retroactive application. The department argued that the trial court erred in allowing the hospital to advance arguments not urged in the administrative proceeding. The appellate court disagreed. Although the hospital changed the legal theory advanced, the claim before the trial court, that an administrative rule was being applied retroactively and thus illegally, was also raised in the administrative proceeding. Thus, the hospital did not fail to exhaust administrative remedies or waive the constitutional challenge by failing to raise it in the administrative proceeding. A department representative acknowledged that its overpayment claim was based on the revision to the manual. Yet it was undisputed that the statement of participation required the hospital to be reimbursed for services in accordance with terms of the manual in effect on the date services were rendered. The trial court's judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a juvenile, was convicted of conspiracy to commit armed robbery. The Georgia superior court denied defendant's motion to transfer her case to juvenile court and sentenced her as an adult to 10 years' confinement. She appealed, contending that O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-11-28 required her to be adjudicated as a juvenile delinquent, and that her sentence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, then 15, was an accomplice to an armed robbery in which two people were shot, one of whom died. Defendant was charged with murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, and other crimes. The appellate court noted that O.C.G.A. &sect; 15-11-28(b)(2)(A)(i) gave the superior court exclusive jurisdiction over defendant's trial for murder; as the conspiracy charge arose from the same criminal transaction, the superior court also had jurisdiction over that offense. Under &sect; 15-11-28(b)(2)(D), the superior court could transfer a case to juvenile court if the juvenile was convicted only of a lesser included offense over which the superior court lacked exclusive jurisdiction, but the superior court also had the discretion to retain jurisdiction for sentencing. Sentencing defendant as an adult did not violate her due process and equal protection rights, as she had no constitutional right to be treated as a juvenile. As the 10-year sentence was within the limits set by O.C.G.A. &sect;&sect; 16-4-8 and 16-8-41(b), and there was no showing the sentence was overly severe or excessive in proportion to the offense, it did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found not guilty of aggravated child molestation and one count of child molestation. Defendant was sentenced to 10 years to serve, and he was granted an out-of-time appeal in 2005. Appointed counsel moved for a new trial, which was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was 17 years old at the time of trial and had asserted that defendant had violated her repeatedly since she was 12 or 13 years old. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the State to introduce the victim's videotaped interviews into evidence. The court found no error, however, since during cross-examination defense counsel placed the victim's veracity into place but questioning her about a key difference between her testimony at trial and her statements to a doctor. The court found that, despite defendant's contention to the contrary, defense counsel's questioning placed the victim's veracity at issue by implying that she had changed her story for trial. As such, it was proper for the trial court to allow the State to admit the evidence of the tape recording, which was a statement to the police. The court found the necessary elements of admission of the tape satisfied, namely that the videotape was consistent with the victim's trial testimony, the victim subsequently testified, and her credibility was eventually attacked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the results of his horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) field sobriety test and of his Intoxilyzer 5000 breath test. Specifically, defendant asserted that the arresting officer did not perform the HGN field sobriety test in accordance with the guidelines for performing the test, and therefore the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the results of the HGN test. The court disagreed, finding that the administrating officer testified to his experience and training as well as the testing and scoring method used. Defendant further asserted that the trial court should have suppressed the results of his Intoxilyzer 5000 breath test as there was a failure to comply with the mandate of O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-6-392(a)(1)(A) to provide requirements for properly operating it and that such failure allowed for ad hoc actions in testing, in violation of his constitutional rights under the Georgia and United States Constitutions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of child molestation (O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-4(a)). He appealed, challenging the trial court's admission of child hearsay on constitutional grounds. The Georgia Supreme Court held he failed to preserve the constitutional challenge, and transferred the case to the intermediate appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant began molesting his stepdaughter when she was seven; the abuse continued for years. The department of family and children services received a tip and questioned the victim, who confirmed that the molestation had occurred. Defendant fled; he was caught in Costa Rica. Defendant claimed the Georgia Child Hearsay Statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-16, was unconstitutional under Crawford. The instant court held that as he failed to raise this constitutional objection until his motion for new trial, he waived it on appeal. The trial court erred in admitting testimony concerning nine similar transactions involving other victims without making the Williams v. State findings. Although the State claimed a hearing was held under Ga. Unif. Super. Ct. R. 31.3(B) before such evidence was admitted, the record on appeal did not reflect this. Not holding a Rule 31.3 (B) hearing was not harmless error, as the only direct testimony came from the victim, there was no physical evidence of the abuse, and defendant did not testify. Under these circumstances, the instant court could not say that the extensive testimony of similar transactions did not measurably contribute to the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was vacated and the case was remanded with directions that the trial court determine whether a Rule 31.3 (B) hearing had been held and, if not, to hold such a hearing. If the similar transaction evidence did not meet the standards of Williams, or if its probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect, a new trial was required. Otherwise, the trial court could re-enter its judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued the trial court erred in admitting the child's videotaped interview because it improperly bolstered her testimony. The appellate court held the videotaped interview was admissible under O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-3-16 as a statement made by a child under the age of 14 years describing an act of sexual contact; whether it also bolstered her testimony was immaterial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions arose from forcing a 15-year-old girl from a bus stop with a gun and sexually assaulting her. In a separate incident, a 21-year-old woman was walking to a bus stop and defendant was identified as the man who tried to force her to go with him. The first victim had obtained the license plate of the vehicle involved, which was defendant's car. Her notebook was found in the car with her name on it. Both victims identified defendant as their respective assailant. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury on the issues of force and consent. The court agreed that the trial court erred by charging the jury that sexual acts directed towards children were presumed forcible and against the will of the child. However, because the evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming, and because his defense of mistaken identity did not place the element of force at issue, the error was deemed harmless. The trial court properly instructed the jury that a victim younger than 16 was legally incapable of consenting to intercourse. The court found no merit in defendant's contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs brought a medical malpractice suit alleging that the doctor negligently implanted radioactive seeds in the healthy lower part of the patient's prostrate while he underwent treatment for prostrate cancer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The doctor was a radiation oncologist for whom the patient sought treatment from regarding prostrate cancer. The trial court concluded that the patient alleged negligent treatment, that his injury occurred on December 28, 2001, and that the statute of limitation expired before he filed suit. The trial court rejected the patient's argument that he suffered a subsequent injury when his cancer metastasized or that there was a misdiagnosis. The trial court also granted the hospital summary judgment upon finding that the doctor was not the hospital's agent or employee. The court held that appellees failed to show, as a matter of law, that the patient manifested symptoms of an injury caused by the alleged negligence more than two years before his suit was filed. The court also found that the patient sufficiently alleged that the doctor covered up his mistake. Therefore, the court reversed the portion of the trial court's order granting summary judgment to the doctor and his practice group. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the hospital since the patient failed to argue the issue he enumerated as error in his brief regarding the hospital.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that rubbing a stomach area did not serve as the basis for a child molestation conviction. The appellate court disagreed. The evidence showed that, during the middle of the night, defendant entered the bedroom where the victim was staying, lay down beside and behind the victim, rubbed her back until his hand went down her pants, pulled up her pajama top, rubbed her stomach area until his hand went under her waistband and began toward her private area, and only stopped when the victim demanded he do so, at which time he admitted the wrongfulness of his actions. A jury could have found such actions immoral and indecent and done with the intent to sexually arouse himself. Contrary to defendant's argument, the factors set forth in O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-4(b)(2) describe an exception to the baseline felony punishment and mitigate or decrease that punishment to the lower level of a misdemeanor if these facts were found during the sentencing hearing, and there was no Apprendi violation.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to 220 years to serve, followed by 20 years of probation. The trial court also ordered that defendant undergo medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, or chemical castration, as a condition of his probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions were based upon his replication of sexually explicit images involving young children. The images were discovered after officers executed a search warrant of defendant's home after he had sent photographs of two young girls over the internet to someone in another country. On appeal from his guilty plea, defendant argued that the length of his sentence was unlawful and violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and that the imposition of chemical castration as a condition of his probation violated Georgia law. The court determined that defendant's sentence term did not shock its conscious in light of the crimes he committed and that it was within the statutorily mandated parameters allowed. The court noted that defendant was actually spared serving the maximum amount of prison time authorized by O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-12-100(g)(1). The court did find, however, that the trial court was not authorized to order defendant to undergo chemical castration as that authority was eliminated via an amendment to O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-6-4(d)(2). The court further found that defendant waived any ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</SPAN></P>

Defendant had been convicted of child molestation with regard to actions involving his three daughters. Defendant was sentenced to 10 years confinement and served three years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following the 10th anniversary of his release from prison, defendant filed the underlying petition. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to release him from the requirement to register under &sect; 42-1-12(g) because the State failed to meet its burden of showing that he posed a substantial risk of reoffense in opposition to his prima facie case to the contrary. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's petition since he characterized his previous criminal conduct toward his children as a mistake and he acknowledged that an open Department of Family and Children Services case existed as to one of his daughters and grandchildren wherein one condition barred his daughter from bringing children around him. Based on that evidence, the court held that defendant failed to present prima facie evidence demonstrating that he no longer posed a substantial risk of reoffending. The court also held that defendant's failure to abide by &sect; 42-1-12 would result in a new crime based on his status as a child molester and, therefore, the statute was not retrospective and, thus, not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction arose with regard to actions he took toward his daughter.

The court did find that by failing to raise an objection to the inadmissible hearsay evidence of the victim's statements made during the videotaped interview, defendant's trial counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under the first prong of the Strickland test. However, defendant failed to show that his trial court's error prejudiced his defense since the statements made by the victim during the videotaped interview were merely cumulative of the testimony she had offered at trial. The court did find that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant for the commission of a felony pursuant to the amended sexual battery statute despite the fact that it was unclear from the jury's verdict whether he was found guilty of pre-amendment misdemeanor or post-amendment felony conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges against defendant arose after he was involved in a two-car collision in which two people were killed and several others were injured. A state trooper who arrived on the scene did not find any signs that defendant was impaired. As defendant's wife was preparing to drive him away from the hospital, an officer approached them and asked defendant to take a blood test. Defendant was never given a consent form nor was advised of his constitutional rights at any time. Defendant took the test, and the test results showed the presence of marijuana. Defendant successfully obtained the suppression of the test results by asserting that he had not been advised of his implied consent rights. The court upheld the suppression, finding that if it condoned the conduct of the officer, the court would effectively eviscerate the implied consent statute,&nbsp;O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-5-55(a). The court held that it was the clear intent of the Georgia Legislature that an officer seeking to obtain a chemical test of a person's bodily substances following an accident involving serious injuries or fatalities must do so via the implied consent statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a bench trial in a Georgia court, defendant stood convicted of speeding. Thus, he appealed, acting pro se, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. Specifically, he contended that the arresting officer's in-court identification of him was tainted and that the trial court should have dismissed his case, as the traffic stop violated O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-14-6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon a review of the evidence in light of defendant's claims, the appeals court found no reason for reversal. First, the trooper's testimony, coupled with the readout of the laser speed detection device, which measured defendant's speed at 61 miles-per-hour, in excess of the posted speed limit of 45 miles-per-hour, was sufficient to support the speeding conviction. Second, defendant's identity as the perpetrator was not at issue. To the contrary, after the trooper made the stop, defendant produced his driver's license and when he was given a traffic citation, he signed it. This signature matched the one on his pro se pleadings. And, defendant presumably sat at defense table during trial, allowing the trooper to ascertain who was on trial for speeding. Third, the appeals court lacked original jurisdiction to address defendant's motions to suppress and for a mistrial. Finally, because the trooper was employed by the State, and not a county, municipality, college, or university, O.C.G.A. &sect; 40-14-6 did not apply to him.</SPAN></P>

Further, despite the fact that the trial court did not expressly rule upon the constitutionality of the statute, retroactive application was not improper, as the General Assembly intended that the law be applied to cases pending at the time it was passed. As to the issue relating to the two experts, the appeals court found that the patient failed to timely challenge the expert evidence via O.C.G.A. &sect; 24-9-67.1(d), by way of a pretrial hearing. Moreover, even assuming that the untimeliness of the patient's request for a hearing did not waive the particular grounds asserted in his motion to strike brought at the close of evidence, he nevertheless waived all remaining objections to the expert testimony by failing to object contemporaneously to the same.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury awarded a judgment to an offeree after his offer was deemed rejected when the offeree did not respond, the offeror moved for attorney's fees and expenses, under O.C.G.A. &sect;&nbsp;9-11-68, because the judgment obtained by the offeree was not at least 25 percent more favorable than the offer of judgment. After the offeree did not respond, the motion was granted. Thus, the offeree appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">For the first time on appeal, the offeree alleged that it was unconstitutional to apply O.C.G.A. &sect; 9-11-68 retroactively and that it violated the fundamental right of access to the courts, due process, and equal protection. But, because she never raised these constitutional issues in the trial court, they could not be considered when asserted for the first time on appeal but had to be clearly raised in the trial court and distinctly ruled upon there. Further, had the constitutional challenge been raised and ruled on in the trial court, and if it presented an unresolved question, jurisdiction would lie in the Supreme Court of Georgia. Second, the offeree argued that under the amended version of the statute, she would not have been required to pay any fees or costs. But, applying the current statute retroactively in would impair the offeror's rights to recover attorney's fees and costs under the statute in effect at the time the offer of settlement was made. Hence, there was no error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowner challenged the judgment of the trial court (Georgia), which resulted in the forfeiture of his real property where he grew marijuana. Appellee, the State of Georgia, had filed a complaint seeking forfeiture of the real property and the items listed in a request for condemnation after the landowner was found guilty of trafficking in and manufacturing marijuana in August 2006. The landowner's motion for a new trial was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On October 22, 2004, law enforcement officers executed a search warrant at real property owned, in part, by the landowner and, as a result, the criminal charges against him arose. The same day, the local sheriff's office filed a request for condemnation that listed personal property seized by it, but the real property was not included. On appeal, the landowner contended that the trial court erred in forfeiting the real property because the State failed to report the seizure of the real property within 20 days, in accordance with O.C.G.A. &sect; 16-13-49(h). The court held that the landowner was not entitled to a reversal of the forfeiture. The court determined that even if the 20 day reporting requirement was applicable, the landowner's remedy under the statute for a violation of the requirement would have been the release of the real property to him pending further forfeiture proceedings and not the dismissal of the entire action. Since the landowner remained in possession of the property until the resolution of the forfeiture proceeding, no error occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's forfeiture of the real property.</SPAN></P>
