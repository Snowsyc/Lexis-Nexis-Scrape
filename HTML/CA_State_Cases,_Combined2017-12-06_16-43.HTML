</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), appealed from orders of the San Diego County Superior Court, California, enjoining CDCR from enforcing the residency restriction of &quot;Jessica's Law,&quot; codified in Pen. Code, &sect; 3003.5, subd. (b), on the ground that the blanket restriction was unconstitutional as a parole condition as applied to registered sex offenders on parole in San Diego County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found the blanket residency restriction, as applied in San Diego County, excessive and unduly broad in relation to its purpose - namely, to establish predator free zones around schools and parks where children gather. The statute limited the housing choices of all sex offenders identically, without regard to the type of victim or the risk of reoffending. The blanket restriction effectively barred sex offender parolees from living in about 97 percent of the existing multifamily rental property that otherwise would be available to them, including in affordable housing located in downtown San Diego where the record showed they were more apt to receive other needed and vital services. The blanket restriction exceeded the scope of its stated objective - the protection of children - because as applied it eliminated nearly all existing affordable housing in the county for sex offender parolees, in essence banishing them from living within most if not all of the county, and because it treated all parolees the same regardless of whether the parolee's crime involved the victimization of children or adults (and thus the need for the residency restriction in the first place).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant juvenile, a serial sex offender, appealed an order of the Contra Costa County Superior Court, California, committing him to the California Division of Juvenile Facilities (DJF) after several failed alternative dispositions. At the time he was adjudicated a ward of the court, the juvenile was not eligible for a DJF commitment, and he was placed there under an amendment to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 731, enacted after his adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the amendment to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 731, was intended to be retroactive. The juvenile's criminal behavior took place before the enactment of the amendment, and those statutory changes were being applied to alter the legal consequences of his violation of Pen. Code, &sect; 288, subd. (a) by making him eligible for a DJF commitment. The court concluded that application of the amendment to &sect; 731 to permit commitment of wards like the juvenile in the DJF was not an ex post facto violation because there was nothing so punitive in the statute's purpose or effect in the juvenile's case that would warrant the court's disregard of the legislature's express intent in enacting it. The amendment did not affix culpability or seek retribution for criminal conduct. The juvenile had suffered a loss of liberty and the stigma of adjudication long before his commitment to DJF, and his confinement was not prolonged by &sect; 731.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the dispositional order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant probationer sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which revoked his probation for attempted possession of a controlled substance for sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The probationer was ordered to complete a drug court treatment program as a condition of probation. After he absconded from the program, the drug court summarily revoked his probation and issued a bench warrant for his arrest. Thereafter, the drug court held a hearing and revoked probation. At a subsequent evidentiary hearing, the probationer testified in mitigation. The court held that the use of an unsworn warrant to arrest the probationer pursuant to Pen. Code, &sect; 1203.2, did not violate the warrant clause of the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const., 4th Amend., because that clause was inapplicable to the arrest of a probationer. Thus, when a warrant was used to arrest a probationer, compliance with the oath or affirmation provision of the warrant clause was not required. Construing &sect; 1203.2 to impliedly require a probable cause hearing when there was any significant delay between a probationer's arrest and a final revocation hearing, the court held that the statute comported with federal due process requirements. Any inadequacy of notice at the first hearing was not prejudicial because the probationer knew the nature of the alleged violation; moreover, the second hearing was adequate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Orange County (California) of one count of sexual penetration with a foreign object on a nine-year-old boy, and one count of committing a forcible lewd act on an eight-year-old boy. Defendant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 15 years to life, for a total of 30 years to life. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was 16 years old when he committed the crimes, raped the nine-year-old victim with a toy light saber, broken at the tip, and forced the eight-year-old victim into participating in that rape. The court held that there was substantial evidence defendant used both force and intimidation against the eight-year-old, including forcibly grabbing him and pulling his pants down. Defendant's sentence was not a de facto life without parole sentence or a functional life without parole sentence, as he would be eligible for parole when he was 47. There was no rule of constitutional jurisprudence that required discretion to reduce penalties when minors were sentenced for adult crimes to periods that still left them a substantial life expectancy after release from prison. The court rejected defendant's claim that his sentence was grossly disproportionate to his offenses, concluding that the punishment fit the crimes, and the criminal. Defendant showed extreme callousness. He already had a substantial criminal record before the assault on the nine-year-old victim, and when first interviewed by police, defendant expressed no remorse, but asserted the nine-year-old victim &quot;liked it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The court found that it followed, also as a general rule, that requiring the parties' compliance with changes in the law made retroactive to them did not violate the terms of the plea agreement, nor did the failure of a plea agreement to reference the possibility the law might change translate into an implied promise the defendant would be unaffected by a change in the statutory consequences attending his or her conviction. To that extent, then, the terms of the plea agreement could be affected by changes in the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court accepted the request and provided a response to the question.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant union sought review of orders from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which, in a dispute concerning health benefits for county employees who were union members, denied mandate relief against respondent county agencies as to claims of failure to bargain in good faith and management interference.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During negotiations with the union, the county adhered to a firm policy enforcing an ordinance, Los Angeles County, Cal., Ord. No. 5.27.020(K). (L), which provided that only unrepresented employees could participate in two health benefit programs. A supervisor circulated a letter suggesting that employees could save their benefits by means of decertification. County management instructed him to refrain from any further decertification efforts. When negotiations concluded without agreement on the health benefits issue, the county unilaterally denied participation in the two plans to union members. The court held that the county's exclusion of union members from health benefit plans that were available to unrepresented county employees violated Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 3504.5(c), which prohibited local authorities from providing different health benefits to unionized employees than to non-unionized employees unless the union agreed. Although enacted after the negotiations took place, &sect; 3504.5(c) was retroactive to a date prior to the county's denial of participation to union members. The court concluded that the supervisor's letter did not significantly influence the negotiations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the denial of mandate relief as to the claim of failure to bargain in good faith and remanded with instructions to grant relief and direct the reinstatement of the union members' benefits.  The court affirmed the denial of mandate relief as to the claim of management interference.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner hotel petitioned for review of a decision of the California Workers' Compensation Appeals Board, which found that respondent employee was entitled to vocational rehabilitation benefits pursuant to Lab. Code, former &sect; 139.5, which was repealed effective January 1, 2009.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that because the Board's decision was not a final determination of the employee's right to vocational rehabilitation benefits and because former &sect; 139.5 had been repealed, the employee was not entitled to such benefits. There was no indication in any legislation passed in the same session in which former &sect; 139.5 was repealed that the legislature intended to save rehabilitation rights or remedies from and after January 1, 2009, or indefinitely. There was no newly enacted statute, nor was the effective sunset date extended before January 1, 2009, or thereafter. The legislature, in effect, preserved or saved vocational rehabilitation claims for nearly five years, but did not save nonfinal rehabilitation rights as of or past January 1, 2009. Although the legislature provided for the possibility of a later statute that would delete or extend the January 1, 2009 date, no such statute was ever enacted. The legislature repealed not only former &sect; 139.5, but also other statutes governing rehabilitation benefits and services, as well as the regulations to implement those benefits and services. Thus, there was no residual application of any repealed statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, several residents of defendant city, sought review of a judgment on the pleadings from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which, in an action challenging the city's plan to fluoridate its drinking water, ruled that the residents failed to state a cause of action for declaratory or injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The residents alleged that a particular chemical, hydrofluorosilicic acid (HFSA), exposed them to unnecessary health risks and violated their constitutional rights. The court, in affirming, held that Cal. Code Civ. Proc. &sect; 1008 did not preclude dismissal of the claims in response to motions in limine. Although directed at particular items of evidence, the motions in limine had the cumulative effect of an objection to all evidence on the ground of failure to state a cause of action. Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 116410 specifically authorized fluoridation of city water, HFSA was approved in accordance with Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 116550(a), and fluoridation was a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power in the interest of public health. Any challenge to the propriety of using HFSA should have been made at the administrative level. The court also rejected the residents' substantive due process claims under U.S. Const. amends. IX, XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. There was no fundamental constitutional right to fluoride-free water, the use of fluoride was not forced medication because the residents were not forced to drink the water, and the rational basis test was met.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court of San Diego County, California, sustained allegations that defendant juvenile was speeding and that she violated the San Diego curfew ordinance, San Diego Mun. Code, &sect; 58.0101 et seq., and therefore found that she was a person described in Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect;&sect; 601 and 602. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the San Diego curfew ordinance swept too broadly and included within its ambit otherwise innocent and legal conduct by minors even when they had the permission of their parents. It was therefore invalid under the United States and California Equal Protection Clauses. Although the ordinance exempted minors attending certain official school, religious, or other recreational activities, it did not permit a minor to travel to or from those activities after 10:00 p.m. (even with parental permission) without being accompanied by an adult. Further, although the ordinance protected a minor exercising First Amendment rights, the protection was hollow because it did not provide for the minor to travel to or from protected activities except when accompanied by an adult. Finally, the ordinance contained no going to or coming home from exemption to permit a minor safely to pass from one exempt location to another. Thus, the ordinance swept within its ambit entirely benign conduct. The People did not articulate of how circumscribing such benign conduct directly and materially furthered the underlying governmental interests of preventing crime and victimization.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the finding that the minor violated the San Diego curfew ordinance and in all other respects affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, farm workers and their union, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which dismissed their complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against respondents, the State of California and two state agencies, alleging that a heat illness prevention regulation was inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The complaint alleged that the State had a constitutional duty to create a workers' compensation system adequate to protect the workers' safety and that it had failed to satisfy its constitutional duty. The court held that the constitutional grant of authority in Cal. Const., art. XIV, &sect; 4, to create workers' compensation laws and occupational health and safety laws was not self-executing. Rather, the constitutional provision gave the Legislature the constitutional authority to create a complete system of workers' compensation, which included enacting appropriate legislation to secure safety in places of employment. The right to securing safety in employment therefore required legislative action to make the constitutional provision operative as a judicially enforceable right. Alternatively, the relief sought violated the separation of powers doctrine as set forth in Cal. Const., art. III, &sect; 3, because the manner of amending occupational safety and health standards was within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government. The court could not divest the legislative and executive branches of discretion to promulgate and enforce safety and health regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of sexual penetration of a victim unable to resist due to intoxication, anesthesia, or controlled substance and rape by intoxication, anesthesia, or controlled substance under Pen. Code &sect;&sect; 289, subd. (e), and 261. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, sentenced him to upper term sentences, with sentences on two rape counts to be served consecutively under Pen. Code, &sect; 667.6, subd. (d). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the imposition of the upper term sentences violated his right to a jury trial. The court agreed. Imposing upper term sentences based on the victim's vulnerability without submitting the question to the jury was Sixth Amendment error. Further, to the extent that the vulnerability finding reflected the jury's determination that the victim was incapable of resisting due to intoxication or controlled substance, there was an illegal dual use of facts. The element of prevention from resisting could not do double duty as an aggravating factor. The court also noted that the trial court appeared to have used the fact of the commission of the offense itself as an aggravating factor. The court found no Sixth Amendment error in imposing consecutive sentences under Pen. Code, &sect; 667.6, subd. (d), which required a finding that offenses were committed on separate occasions. The court reasoned that the trial court had the discretion under &sect; 667.6, subd. (c), to sentence defendant to full consecutive sentences based on the facts encompassed by the verdict alone; therefore, the finding under &sect; 667.6, subd. (d), did not increase the penalty beyond the statutory maximum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment to impose middle term sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district attorney filed a wardship petition against defendant juvenile, alleging a misdemeanor battery on school property (Pen. Code, &sect; 243.2, subd. (a)(1)). Defendant admitted to simple misdemeanor battery (Pen. Code, &sect; 242). The Superior Court of Fresno County, California, committed him to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Juvenile Justice, Division of Juvenile Facilities (DJF). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">More than a year earlier, the juvenile court had found true an allegation of first-degree burglary against defendant and had determined that the maximum period of confinement was six years. The juvenile court had then deferred entry of judgment pursuant to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 790. The court held that amendments to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect;&sect; 731 and 733, which took effect on September 1, 2007, and which stated that a juvenile court could commit a ward to DJF only if the petition upon which the ward was committed was for certain enumerated offenses, did not apply to a disposition that occurred before September 1, 2007. The common-law rule requiring application of statutes that mitigated punishment to all cases not yet final on their effective dates was inapplicable. The amendments did not mitigate punishment because they did not reduce the amount of time any juvenile offender was confined. Rather, they only limited the places in which juveniles committing certain offenses could be confined. Because the juvenile court committed defendant to the DJF before September 1, 2007, he was not entitled to reversal of the commitment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a citizens organization and two individuals, initiated a taxpayer lawsuit against governmental defendants, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to bar implementation of the California Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act of 2007. The Sacramento County Superior Court, California, sustained defendants' demurrers to the complaint without leave to amend and entered a judgment of dismissal. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act authorized the issuance of up to $ 7.4 billion in bonds for the construction and renovation of prisons. Plaintiffs alleged the proposed bonds would violate the state debt limit set forth in Cal. Const., art. XVI, &sect; 1. Because plaintiffs mounted a facial challenge to the Act, it had to be upheld if there was any way the Act could be implemented that would not violate the state debt limit. The court concluded that the Act could be implemented in such a way as to fall within the contingency exception to the state debt limit, inasmuch as payments from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to the California Public Works Board, and from the Board to bondholders, would be based on use or availability of the facilities constructed with the bond proceeds during the period in which future payments would be made. The state did not undertake an obligation that offended the pay-as-you-go principle underlying the state debt limit. Defendants' demurrers to the complaint were properly sustained. It was mere speculation whether the bonds and leases would violate the state debt limit. Plaintiffs were not entitled to leave to amend based solely on speculation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a suit filed by the real party in interest, the son of a singer, against petitioner, who had kidnapped the singer's son, the kidnapper sought review of a judgment of the California Court of Appeal denying his motion for a writ of mandate and holding that California's &quot;Son of Sam&quot; law, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 2225, did not unconstitutionally infringe the right of free speech. The kidnapper sought further review, which the instant court granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue in this case was whether the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; law facially violated constitutional protections of speech by appropriating, as compensation for crime victims, all monies due to a convicted felon from expressive materials that included the story of the crime. The singer's son's complaint alleged, among other things, that the kidnapper and one or both accomplices arranged with other party defendants for the kidnapper to be interviewed about the crime. The singer's son's claimed that all monies due to the kidnappers or to their representatives for preparation for sale of the kidnapping story were &quot;proceeds&quot; and &quot;profits&quot; as defined by the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; law and were subject to an involuntary trust in favor of the singer's son as a statutory &quot;beneficiary.&quot; The instant court held that the &quot;Son of Sam&quot; law was facially invalid under both the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the liberty of speech clause under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2(a). The &quot;Son of Sam&quot; law was overinclusive, as it penalized the content of speech to an extent far beyond that necessary to transfer the fruits of crime from criminals to their uncompensated victims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the appellate court was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed in the instant court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two 17-year-old defendants were convicted in separate cases of special circumstance murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole under Pen. Code, &sect; 190.5, subd. (b). As to one defendant, the California Court of Appeal concluded remanding for resentencing would be futile. As to the other defendant, the California Court of Appeal vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. Defendants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that Pen. Code, &sect; 190.5, subd. (b), properly construed, conferred discretion on a trial court to sentence a 16- or 17-year-old juvenile convicted of special circumstance murder to life without parole or to 25 years to life, with no presumption in favor of life without parole. A trial court, in exercising its sentencing discretion, was required to consider the distinctive attributes of youth and how those attributes diminished the penological justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders before imposing life without parole on a juvenile offender. Because the sentencing regime created by &sect; 190.5, subd. (b), authorized and indeed required consideration of the distinctive attributes of youth highlighted by the United States Supreme Court, no constitutional infirmity was found with &sect; 190.5, subd. (b), once it was understood not to impose a presumption in favor of life without parole. The court concluded that neither trial court in the instant cases made its sentencing decision with awareness of the full scope of discretion conferred by &sect; 190.5, subd. (b), or with proper guidance for the proper exercise of its discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Cross-appeals were taken from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which, in two consolidated cases, declared that plaintiff counties were entitled to reimbursement under Cal. Const., art. XIII B, &sect; 6, for state-mandated costs and granted mandate relief under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1085, requiring defendant, the State of California, to pay the counties over a 15-year period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The counties sought payment from numerous state agencies. The court held that the writ of mandate violated the separation of powers doctrine in Cal. Const., art. III, &sect; 3 because the power to make appropriations as set forth in Cal. Const., art. XVI, &sect; 7, and Cal. Const., art. IV, &sect;&sect; 10, 12, was not a judicial power. The Legislature could not be judicially compelled to appropriate sufficient funds to satisfy the State's reimbursement obligations to the counties. Moreover, the counties had an adequate remedy under Gov. Code, &sect; 17617. Although it could be said that the State generally had a ministerial duty to reimburse local agencies for state-mandated programs and services, the trial court reasonably exercised its discretion when it declined to order prompt payment because of the complexity of the claims. Section 17617 did not impair a contractual right to reimbursement because Cal. Const., art. XIII B, &sect; 6, did not create such a right. A monetary award was improper as declaratory relief under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1060, because there was no actual controversy as to the State's obligation to pay, and monetary damages were not available for a violation of Cal. Const., art. XIII B, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded with directions to the superior court to vacate the peremptory writ of mandate and to enter a judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division One (California), which reversed her convictions for the offenses of battery on a custodial officer under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was belligerent during booking and resisted a pat-search. She grabbed a custodial officer's arm and later charged at an officer. The court held that a rational basis existed for the statutory scheme pertaining to battery on a custodial officer. The legislature reasonably could have concluded that reduction of the Cal. Penal Code &sect; 243.1 offense was not appropriate in cases of a battery on a custodial officer that was deemed serious enough by the prosecutor to warrant felony prosecution. The court of appeal erred by remanding for a Kelly/Frye hearing regarding the admissibility of polygraph evidence to support defendant's claim that her commission of the charged offenses resulted from her unknowing and involuntary ingestion of drugs. The court of appeal should have addressed whether the categorical exclusion in Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 351.1 of polygraph evidence would be unconstitutional in the event defendant was able to satisfy the Kelly/Frye test. In light of the continuing division of opinion regarding the reliability of polygraph evidence, the California legislature did not act arbitrarily or disproportionately in promulgating and retaining the per se rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff construction companies challenged San Francisco's Minority/Women/Local Business Utilization Ordinance, which called for race- and gender-conscious remedies to ameliorate the effects of past discrimination in awarding contracts. The Superior Court of San Francisco County, California, granted summary judgment for the companies, rejecting the arguments of defendants, the city and associated individuals and entities. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court struck down the ordinance as violative of Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 31. The court agreed that &sect; 31 was not preempted by the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which did not mandate race-conscious special measures. Therefore, &sect; 31 could be reconciled with it. Section 31 also did not offend the Hunter/Seattle restructuring arm of equal protection jurisprudence. The dual prohibition against discrimination and preferential treatment, coupled with its savings clause, propelled &sect; 31 into neutral territory that brooked no impermissible racial classification. The court also held that there was insufficient evidence to rouse the federal funding exception to &sect; 31. The ordinance was not required to maintain the city's eligibility for such funds. However, it was error not to determine whether the ordinance was mandated by the United States Constitution as a narrowly tailored program to remedy ongoing, pervasive discrimination in public contracting. A prior version of the ordinance had survived a Croson challenge in the federal courts, and the city argued vigorously that the record supported the same result as to the current version.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded the matter for the trial court to determine whether the ordinance was mandated by the Constitution. In all other respects, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff chiropractors appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Francisco County (California), which dismissed their action against defendant, the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners (California), following the trial court's grant of the Board's motion for summary judgment in the chiropractors' action challenging Cal. Code Regs. tit. 16, &sect; 302, which defined the scope of chiropractic practice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board promulgated &sect; 302 to implement Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 1000-7 of the Chiropractic Initiative Act of 1922, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 1000-1 et seq.&nbsp;Cal. Code Regs. tit. 16, &sect; 302(a)(4)(E) explicitly did not allow chiropractors to practice surgery or penetrate tissues of human beings. The court held that Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 1000-7 limited authorized chiropractic healing practices to those taught in chiropractic schools at the time of the enactment of the initiative measure (1922). Chiropractors were thus confined to the established measures of adjusting the joints by hand and to incidental mechanical and hygienic measures. The scope of practice as fixed by &sect; 1000-7 was unaffected by the 1978 amendment to the Chiropractic Act. The laws regulating chiropractic and drugless practitioners differently were rationally related to the public interest of protecting the public from individuals the lawmakers deemed should be confined to healing arts within the traditional scope of that practice. The 1978 amendment did not violate the express language of Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 12 because it did not confer a special privilege or advantage on the Council on Chiropractic Education.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff insureds sued defendants, the California Department of Managed Health Care and its director, for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that their approval of mandatory binding arbitration clauses in health care service plans violated the right to a jury trial. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, sustained defendants' demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action. The insureds appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the Knox-Keene Act, Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 1340 et seq., the department approved mandatory, binding arbitration clauses in health benefit plans. Insured employees and an employer argued that the department had to disapprove any plan that required resolution of disputes through binding arbitration. The court disagreed, finding no statutory or constitutional violation. The federal and state constitutions did not support a claim of a constitutional right to choose between arbitration and jury trial. U.S. Const. amend. VII did not apply to the state court issue. The fundamental problem with the argument under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 was that the California Supreme Court recognized that an employer entering into a health care plan on behalf of its employees had the authority to waive the right to jury trial through agreement to binding arbitration. Under the precedent, adhesion contract principles were not a basis to find the clauses unenforceable. Further, when the legislature later enacted requirements for disclosure of arbitration agreements, it showed an intent to allow binding arbitration in health care service plans negotiated by employers acting as employees' agents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Deciding whether grandparents should have visitation with their grandchildren over the objection of a parent was the type of case that tugged at the hearts of most trial judges, evoking memories of personal experiences with their own families--both good and bad.  Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 3102 permitted a grandparent to visit a minor child if either parent of an unemancipated minor child was deceased. The mother of a minor contended &sect; 3102 was unconstitutional. The reviewing court agreed. Application of &sect; 3102 to the mother unconstitutionally infringed upon her fundamental parenting rights protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The officer and appellant employee organization sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hearing officer found that good cause existed for the production of the requested records and ordered the department to produce the requested records for his in camera review. The court found that the trial court had jurisdiction to grant administrative mandamus. Because the hearing officer's authority to rule on a Pitchess motion was the issue before the court, the irreparable harm exception to the finality rule permitted the department to seek judicial intervention. The court held that the hearing officer had the authority to rule on the Pitchess motion. Case law did not hold that Pitchess discovery was unavailable in all administrative proceedings as a matter of law. Rather, an administrative hearing officer could rule on a Pitchess motion where Pitchess discovery was relevant. An interpretation of Evid. Code, &sect;&sect; 1043 and 1045, that excluded administrative bodies as venues for Pitchess motions, conflicted with the due process rights afforded to peace officers in disciplinary hearings by Gov. Code, &sect; 3304, subd. (b). The court concluded that remand for a ruling on the merits was not required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the order granting the writ petition and directed the trial court to deny the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Governor of California challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of the County of Alameda (California), which found that the two-day-a-month unpaid furlough program for state employees instituted by the Governor and the subsequently expanded three-day-a-month unpaid furlough program put in place by the Governor on July 1, 2009, were invalid because they violated certain statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the trial court interpreted the applicable statutes incorrectly. The provisions of Gov. Code, &sect; 19851, were not intended to apply to the type of unpaid furloughs at issue. Moreover, the trial court's analysis under Gov. Code, &sect; 16310, assumed that furloughing state employees necessarily resulted in the transfer of funds, and implicitly that it was the transfer of funds that caused a less efficiently functioning agency. But there was no evidence to support the conclusion that upon furloughing the represented employees a transfer of funds took place. Section 16310, subd. (a), stated that the transfer of funds could not interfere. The trial court thus erred when it ruled that a statute that prohibited one act, the transfer of funds, was ipso facto violated by a different act, the furloughing of state employees. The Governor could validly furlough state employees paid by the federal government. The third furlough day was valid. The legislature did not change the rules and violate vested rights when it enacted the 2009 revisions to the 2008 Budget Act. Rather, it maintained the status quo by ratifying and giving legal force to a furlough program already in place.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment invalidating the furlough programs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Consolidated appeals were taken from judgments of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which invalidated state legislation transferring tax increment funds from redevelopment agencies; awarded Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1021.5, attorney fees to plaintiffs, an association of redevelopment agencies and others; and found valid Assem. Bill No. 4X 26 (Stats. 2009, 4th Ex. Sess., ch. 21), allowing defendant officials to transfer the funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When the first judgment invalidated the transfers, the association's members recovered a large amount of funds. The court held that the association was not entitled to attorney fees because it had a financial stake in pursuing the litigation to the same extent as its members; thus, no disproportionate financial burden was shown. The association could not recover fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988 because it did not prevail on a federal civil rights claim or any claim factually related thereto. Although the redevelopment agencies had been dissolved, the appeals were not moot because successor agencies existed. Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 16, did not preclude reallocation of tax increment funds from redevelopment agencies to other state purposes. The reallocation prohibition in Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 25.5, subd. (a)(1)(A), did not apply to redevelopment agencies. Impairment of contract and takings claims were premature. No equal protection violations were shown as to school funding, nor was Proposition 98 (approved 1988) violated. Cal. Const., art. XIII A, &sect; 1, subd. (a), expressly authorized apportionment among local entities. No gift of public funds occurred under Cal. Const., art. XVI, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgments and reversed the award of attorney fees to the association.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant school district expelled plaintiff student from its schools. The student sought injunctive and declaratory relief, asserting a facial challenge to the district's administrative regulations. The student claimed that the regulations violated state law and were unconstitutional. The Superior Court of San Diego County (California) agreed and entered a judgment enjoining the district from enforcing the regulations. The district appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A middle school vice-principal recommended that the student be expelled because she was involved in repeated acts of fighting. After a series of hearings, the district expelled the student. Under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 48915(a), (e), this type of offense could lead to an expulsion, but a school principal had the discretion to decide not to refer the matter for an expulsion hearing. Under the district's &quot;zero tolerance&quot; regulations, a school principal had no such discretion and referral was mandatory. The trial court enjoined the district from enforcing the regulations, finding that they violated state law and were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court stated that there were no provisions in the California Education Code requiring a school district to provide a principal with the authority to dismiss an expulsion charge, if the principal found the student committed an expulsion offense. Additionally, eliminating a principal's discretion to unilaterally reject an expulsion remedy at the outset of the process did not affect a student's entitlement to the district's expansive procedural protections or diminish a student's rights to fully challenge the expulsion charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that defendant could not be committed to an indeterminate term of commitment retroactive to the first order committing him as a sexually violent predator. Amendments to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect;&sect; 6604 &amp; 6604.1, providing for an indeterminate term applied prospectively. Defendant, who had already been committed as a sexually violent predator before the amendments to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect;&sect; 6604 &amp; 6604.1, took effect was entitled to an extension proceeding at which there would be a new determination of his status as a sexually violent predator. The amended SVPA contemplated subsequent proceedings regarding release or discharge after the initial commitment proceeding and initial commitment order. The continued reference to an &quot;initial&quot; commitment order in Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 6604.1, subd. (a), after it was amended reflected a distinction between the various SVPA proceedings, rather than a clear indication that the electorate intended to retroactively impose an indeterminate term on those already committed under the SVPA. The court also concluded that a pending petition to extend defendant's commitment should not be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The unsuccessful bidder had an existing maintenance services contract with the state. After a new maintenance contract was awarded to the successful bidder, a hearing on a bid protest was scheduled for a date after the expiration of the existing contract. An interim sole source contract was awarded to the successful bidder for the period of the protest, under the authority of Cal. State Contracting Manual &sect; 6.05. The unsuccessful bidder argued that the regulation was invalid, as the enactment of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 14615.1, which purported to exempt the California Department of General Services from the requirements of the California Administrative Procedure Act, violated the single-subject rule of Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9. The court found no merit in that argument, observing that, although Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 14615.1 was enacted as part of S.B. 1645 (Cal. 1998), a bill concerning the disposal of surplus property, the subject of the bill could be viewed as the operation and administration of the California Department of General Services with respect to state property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Separate juries of the San Diego County Superior Court, California, convicted two defendants of selling or possessing counterfeit marks, Pen. Code, &sect; 350, subd. (a)(2), and found true allegations defendants sold or possessed 1,000 or more articles, or articles valued at more than $400, displaying or containing a counterfeit mark. The trial court ordered defendants to pay almost $43,000 in victim restitution. Both defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendants' convictions. The evidence showed the female defendant, as a principal, and the male defendant, as an aider and abettor, sold counterfeit items to numerous people at various venues. The items bore the word marks of several companies. The evidence also showed law enforcement officers seized over 13,000 of these items from defendants' store. The trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury the prosecutor had to prove the male defendant possessed or sold a counterfeit mark with the intent to defraud the mark holder or an innocent purchaser, as intent to defraud is not an element of a &sect; 350 violation. The appellate court rejected defendants' contention that &sect; 350 was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court was obliged to order defendants to pay restitution to the trademark holders regardless of whether they were direct victims. The trial court did not act irrationally or arbitrarily in waiting to grant the female defendant's motion to reduce her conviction to a misdemeanor until after it ensured she complied with her probation and did not resume her unlawful business operations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which convicted defendant of drunk driving under Veh. Code, &sect; 23152, and sentenced him pursuant to Veh. Code, &sect; 23550, for having had a fourth drunk driving conviction within a 10-year period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The oldest of defendant's four offenses was more than seven but less than 10 years old at the time Veh. Code, &sect; 23550, was amended to extend the look-back period pertaining to prior convictions from the seven-year period formerly in effect to a 10-year period. The court held that the use of the oldest offense for enhancement purposes did not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws in U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1. Defendant was not being punished for the prior offense but for the current offense. His conviction for the prior offense was not based on a quantum of evidence that would have been insufficient before &sect; 23550 was amended. When defendant committed the current offense, he was on notice of the law and of the fact that, if he committed a new crime, all of his prior convictions within 10 years would be counted for the purposes of enhancement under &sect; 23550. Enhancing the sentence in a new criminal prosecution stemming from new criminal conduct was not equivalent to the ex post facto violation of reviving a prosecution in its entirety after the statute of limitations had run.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which convicted him of second-degree robbery, in violation of Pen. Code, &sect; 211.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court's imposition of a $ 20 security fee upon him pursuant to Pen. Code, &sect; 1465.8, violated ex post facto laws. Section 1465.8 did not become effective until two months after defendant's robbery was committed. The court held that the court security fee was valid. The fee could be imposed upon a defendant who committed his crime before the effective date of the statute without offending ex post facto principles. The legislature imposed the fee for a nonpunitive purpose, and the fee did not enhance defendant's punishment for conduct previously committed. Although the robbery offense was committed before the law was enacted, the proceedings for which the fee was collected took place almost exclusively after the effective date of the statute. Thus, the change in the law to collect a $ 20 fee for court security did not carry with it a propensity for unfairness disfavoring retroactive application. Defendant also did not incur additional punishment from imposition of the fee. Unless the consequences were penal in nature, defendants could not rely on statutes in existence at the time of the crime, or otherwise complain of oppressive retroactive treatment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which rejected their challenge to the validity of a measure that imposed a qualified special tax on taxable residential, commercial, and industrial property within defendant school district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The measure taxed non-exempt residential parcels and small commercial/industrial parcels at the same rate, while imposing a higher rate on large commercial/industrial parcels. Exemptions were provided for senior and disabled homeowner residents. The complaint alleged that the measure exceeded the taxing authority of school districts under Gov. Code, &sect; 50079, because the tax did not apply uniformly to all parcels in the district. The trial court applied an equal protection analysis in finding the measure rationally based and thus valid. The court found the school district's equal protection argument misplaced, noting that the measure had not been challenged on equal protection grounds. The court held that the definitional language in &sect; 50079, subd. (b)(2), was language of limitation and did not empower school districts to create tax classifications and impose different tax rates. Thus, the measure was invalid to the extent it imposed a higher tax on some properties. The invalid portion could be severed because its absence left a coherent, functioning tax measure that accomplished the voters' intent to a substantial extent. The exemptions did not exceed the district's authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed as to the property classification and differential tax rate provisions, affirmed as to the limited exemptions provided for senior and disabled homeowner residents, and remanded with directions to the trial court to enter judgment accordingly and to determine whether any further remedies would be appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, Department of Personnel Administration and public employee unions, appealed a judgment of the Court of Appeal of California, Third Appellate District, holding that, in allowing employees to challenge a disciplinary action through a grievance/arbitration process instead of seeking review before plaintiff State Personnel Board, memoranda of understanding and the implementing legislation violated Cal. Const., art. VII, &sect; 3, subd. (a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The memoranda of understanding (MOU's) of four state employee bargaining units allowed covered employees to challenge disciplinary actions either by seeking review before the Board or by pursuing an alternative grievance/arbitration procedure that bypassed the Board. The court held that the bypass of the Board violated Cal. Const., art. VII, &sect; 3, subd. (a), which provided that the Board was to review disciplinary actions taken against state civil service employees. It would be inimical to California's constitutionally mandated merit-based system of civil service, which was administered by the Board, to wholly divest that board of authority to review employee disciplinary actions in favor of an MOU-created review board. By vesting in the nonpartisan Board the sole authority to administer the state civil service system, pursuant to Cal. Const., art. VII, &sect; 2, the state constitution recognized that the task had to be entrusted to a single agency, the constitutionally created Board. Because employee discipline was an integral part of the civil service system, the Board's exclusive authority to review disciplinary decisions was a critical component of the civil service system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant home equity purchaser appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Riverside, California, which declared the deed to plaintiff's seller's home void and ruled that the seller was entitled to title to the home based on the purchaser's violation of Civ. Code, &sect; 1695.17, a provision of California's Home Equity Sales Contracts Act (HESC), Civ. Code, &sect; 1695 et seq. The trial court awarded attorney fees to the seller in a posttrial motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By cross-appeal, the seller challenged orders denying him leave to amend his complaint and granting the purchaser's motion in limine precluding him from raising a Civ. Code, &sect; 1695.16, issue. The trial court ruled that because the purchaser's representative was not bonded (and the purchaser concomitantly failed to provide proof of the bond) the purchase contract was voidable and the seller was entitled to reclaim title to the home from the purchaser. The court found that persons of ordinary intelligence had to necessarily guess at what &sect; 1695.17 required for them to comply with its obligations. Accordingly, the bond requirement of &sect; 1695.17 was void for vagueness under the Due Process Clause and could not be enforced. Although the bond requirement could not be enforced, the remainder of the statutory scheme remained valid because the clauses containing the bond requirement were grammatically, functionally, and volitionally severable from the remaining provisions of the HESC. Because there was no allegation that the contract violated &sect; 1695.16, the court concluded that any evidence on that issue was outside of the scope of the complaint and was properly excluded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment, except insofar as the trial court denied the seller's motion for leave to amend and granted the purchaser's motion in limine on the &sect; 1695.16 claim. The court vacated the order awarding attorney fees. On remand, the trial court was to enter judgment in favor of the purchaser.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners demurred to the complaint, contending that &sect; 707(d) was unconstitutional. The superior court overruled the demurrers, but the court of appeal held that &sect; 707(d) violated the separation of powers doctrine by allowing the prosecutor to interfere with the court's authority to choose a juvenile court disposition for minors found to have committed criminal offenses. On review, the state supreme court disagreed. In light of prior case authority considering prosecutorial charging discretion, the state supreme court concluded that &sect; 707(d) did not deprive petitioners of their constitutional rights. The prosecutor's exercise of discretion, pursuant to &sect; 707(d), whether to file an accusatory pleading in criminal court was within the scope of the executive power and did not violate the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent guardians filed a petition under Prob. Code, &sect; 1516.5, to terminate the parental rights of appellant mother, who had agreed to permanent guardianship of her child in 2001. A trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that adoption by the guardians would be in the child's best interest and terminated the mother's parental rights. The Court of Appeal, Third Appellate District, California, affirmed. The mother sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that &sect; 1516.5 was facially constitutional. A showing of current unfitness was not always necessary when a court terminated parental rights. Section 1516.5 applied to parents whose custody rights had been suspended during a probate guardianship. A termination proceeding under the statute occurred only when the parent had failed to exercise any custodial responsibility for a two-year period, with the possible exception of visitation. In that context, it made little sense to require a showing that the parent was currently unfit. As guardianship continued for an extended period, the child developed an interest in a stable, continuing placement, and the guardian acquired a recognized interest in the care and custody of the child. Section 1516.5 appropriately required a court to balance all the familial interests in deciding what was best for the child. The &quot;least detrimental alternative&quot; standard invoked by the mother was effectively included in the determination of the child's best interest. The trial court's retroactive application of &sect; 1516.5 in the mother's case was consistent with due process and with the transitional provisions of Prob. Code, &sect; 3, subd. (h).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner challenged the judgment and order of the Contra Costa County Superior Court (California) denying his writ of mandate, affirming the administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision that petitioner violated the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act, Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 12275-12290, and upholding the ALJ's decision not to renew his permit to sell assault weapons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">For many years, petitioner possessed permits and licenses from respondent, the Department of Justice, authorizing the possession, transportation, or sale of assault weapons. Subsequently, respondent revoked petitioner's permit and stated that upon the expiration of his existing permit, he would be prohibited from selling, transporting, or otherwise possessing assault weapons. The administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that by acquiring, possessing, and selling unregistered assault weapons, petitioner violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12280. The ALJ also determined that he violated &sect; 12285(b)(1) by selling assault weapons on consignment. Petitioner claimed that respondent misinterpreted the applicable provisions of the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 (AWCA), Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 12275-12290. The court found that no provision of the AWCA authorized holders of an assault weapon permit or licensed gun dealers to possess and sell unregistered weapons. The court found that consignment sales were not consistent with the AWCA. Thus, the trial court properly ruled that petitioner violated the AWCA, and that respondent's refusal to renew his permit was justified.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect; 31, added by the adoption of Proposition 209, plaintiff, as a taxpayer litigant, appealed a judgment of the Sacramento County Superior Court (California), which rejected plaintiff's constitutional challenge to the statutory schemes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff challenged the statutory schemes at issue on the ground that they impermissibly established classifications and preferences based on race, ethnicity, and gender. The real parties in interest asserted that the data collection and reporting requirements applicable to state contracting could be severed from the remainder of the statutory schemes and upheld. One of the parties challenged plaintiff's standing. The instant court held that: (1) plaintiff had standing to maintain this litigation; (2) the statutory scheme applicable to the state lottery was invalid; (3) the statutory scheme applicable to the sale of state bonds was invalid, but a portion of the data collection and reporting requirements of the scheme could be severed and upheld; (4) the statutory scheme applicable to the state civil service was partially invalid, but the remainder of the scheme could be severed and upheld; (5) the statutory scheme applicable to the community colleges was invalid in toto; and (6) a portion of the data collection and reporting requirements of the statutory scheme applicable to state contracting could be severed from the invalid portions of the scheme and upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, an assignee of a lottery prize winner, challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, dismissing its action against respondent California State Lottery Commission. The assignee had sought declaratory relief, contending that the Commission was required by law to recognize and accommodate an assignment of the last three years of the prize winner's lottery winnings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prize winner had entered into a written agreement whereby she sold and assigned her right, title, and interest in the final three jackpot prize payments. The court held that the application of California law governing the interpretation of conflicting statutes compelled the conclusion that the provisions of the California State Lottery Act, Gov. Code, &sect; 8880 et seq., prevailed over the conflicting provisions of Cal. U. Com. Code, &sect; 9406, subd. (f). The legislature did not express a specific intent to override the Lottery Act. The California Uniform Commercial Code could and should be harmonized with Gov. Code, &sect; 8880.325. Section 8880.325, subd. (b), did not permit the assignment at issue. The assignee's position that the assignment was an involuntary assignment, made &quot;in the context&quot; of a marital dispute, was belied by its own allegations and judicially noticed facts regarding another state's judgment. Regardless of whether &sect; 8880.325, subd. (h)'s specific ban on assignment of the last three years of prize payments applied, the assignee had failed to raise any specific applicable exception to &sect; 8880.325's general prohibition on assignment of lottery prizes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The university, affiliated with the Church of Christ, fired two professors because of the perception that they had had an affair while one professor's divorce was still pending. The professors sued the university. The trial court denied the university's motion for summary judgment and, citing Cal. R. Ct. 313(a), refused to even consider summary adjudication because the university had not organized its points and authorities by cause of action. The university petitioned for writ relief. The court held that the trial court erred in refusing to consider summary adjudication. Nothing in the governing rules required points and authorities to be organized by each cause of action. However, the court denied the petition, stating that it could not say as a matter of law that the ministerial exception applied. The professors were nonordained and they taught a subject, marriage and family counseling, that was not necessarily religious. Additionally, there were triable issues of fact as to whether the university discriminated against the professors to the degree that it chose not to renew one contract due to a rule against two married people making up the full-time faculty in one department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, previously appointed judges of the State Bar Court, contended the amendments to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;6079.1(a) and &sect;6086.65(a) violated the separation of powers provision of Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. The amendments provided that some of the hearing judges would be appointed by the executive and legislative branches and that the lay judge of the review department was replaced with a judge who was a member of the State Bar. The court concluded its inherent authority over attorney admission and discipline included the power to appoint judges of the State Bar Court and to specify their qualifications. However, other appointment mechanisms specified by the legislature were permissible. The court held the legislation did not defeat or materially impair the supreme court's authority over the practice of law, and thus did not violate the separation of powers provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petition denied. Legislation permitting executive and legislative branches to appoint some judges in State Bar Court, pursuant to procedures court prescribed, and requiring them to be lawyers, did not violate separation of powers since it was not material impairment of court's inherent power over attorney discipline.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant pharmacy sued respondent drug claims processors alleging that the processors violated Civ. Code, &sect; 2527, subd. (c), by failing to provide required fee studies. The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, found that the reporting requirement violated free speech under Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 2, and therefore granted judgment on the pleadings and a special motion to strike and awarded attorney's fees. The pharmacy appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Civ. Code, &sect; 2527, required processors to obtain and transmit drug processing cost reports to its clients. In affirming the judgment for the processors, the court held that &sect; 2527 and related enforcement provisions violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2. The statute was properly classified as true compelled speech, and the fact that the speech concerned statistical information did not make it less entitled to First Amendment scrutiny. Civ. Code, &sect; 2527, was a content-based regulation of non-commercial speech and therefore was subject to strict scrutiny. Under that standard, the regulation was not narrowly tailored to achieve the governmental interest of encouraging insurers to pay pharmacists a fair rate for drug dispensing services because the pharmacies could publish the dispensing fee studies and transmit them to insurers. The court also held that the refusal to comply with the statute was an act in furtherance of the processors' right of free speech, within the meaning of Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 425.16, the anti-strategic lawsuit against public participation (anti-SLAPP) statute. The trial court had no choice but to grant an anti-SLAPP motion and to award fees to the processors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the California Building Standards Commission and five other state agencies, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted a peremptory writ of mandate in favor of respondent trade association. The writ of mandate compelled the Commission and the agencies to adopt certain provisions of the Uniform Plumbing Code as part of the California Plumbing Code without environmental review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The disputed provisions involved the use of cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) pipes. The Commission and the agencies adopted other provisions of the Uniform Plumbing Code but, citing safety and environmental concerns, chose not to adopt provisions allowing the use of PEX. The court concluded that the evidence in the administrative record, which included a letter from an environmental consultant, supported the conclusions that the use of PEX could present an unreasonable risk of harm and that environmental review was necessary. Thus, the Commission and the agencies properly exercised their discretion under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 18930(a)(3), (7). Evidentiary findings in support of the administrative decision were not required. Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 17922(a), (b), 18931(a) did not result in the automatic adoption of model code provisions after expiration of the time limits set forth in those statutes; such delegation of legislative authority would violate Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The regulations could be a &quot;project&quot; for purposes of environmental review under Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 21065 even if they did not cause an immediate environmental impact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed with directions to the superior court to vacate the peremptory writ of mandate and to enter a judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought an injunction and writ of mandate to compel respondent California appellate courts and judicial council to publish all appellate court opinions and to permanently enjoin them from enforcing rules governing the publication of opinions. The trial court granted respondents' demurrer, primarily on the ground the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and dismissed the case. On appeal, the court found appellant's complaint did not identify any specific injury appellant or those he purported to represent had suffered or would suffer due to the non-publication of an appellate opinion. Absent such an allegation, appellant lacked standing to bring his action. Even if appellant had alleged a specific situation where non-publication harmed or would harm him, he would have been unable to state a viable cause of action. The court reasoned that the California Legislature and the electorate had clearly disclosed an intent that the decisional law of the state did not require publication of every opinion of the intermediate appellate courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution appealed a judgment from the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Three (California), which affirmed the superior court's dismissal of an information charging defendant with cruelty to an animal, making a criminal threat, and willful cruelty to a child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant killed a cat, dangled a child over a balcony, and threatened a neighbor who called police. Defendant was placed in custody. The prosecutor sought and obtained a continuance of the preliminary examination. The magistrate denied defendant's request for own recognizance (OR) release. Subsequently, the superior court dismissed the information pursuant to Pen. Code, &sect; 995, based on the magistrate's erroneous denial of OR release in violation of Pen. Code, &sect; 859b. The court stated that OR release was required after the prosecution secured a continuance for good cause pursuant to &sect; 859b. Pen. Code, &sect; 1318, which governed the terms of an OR release agreement, did not give the magistrate discretion in granting OR release. Neither the terms of Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 12, regarding OR release nor the separation-of-powers doctrine rendered Pen. Code, &sect; 859b, unconstitutional on its face. The superior court erred, however, in setting aside the information on the basis of the magistrate's error in the absence of a determination that the error reasonably might have affected the outcome of the preliminary examination. The failure to grant OR release was not inherently prejudicial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeal and remanded to that court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the protestors contended that the actual notice provision of the prior injunction was unconstitutional and invalid. The appellate court agreed, holding that the intensity of the abortion debate did not somehow entitle the agency to broader relief than parties seeking equitable relief in other contexts. If anything, the opposite was true. Because the actual notice provision purported to enjoin all demonstrators in addition to the enjoined parties, the restriction was overbroad on its face. Absent evidence that the protestors acted together with or on behalf of parties enjoined by the prior injunction, the controversy between the protestors and the agency did not involve the same parties, subject matter, or facts which supported the judgment pursuant to which the prior injunction was entered. Thus, the appellate court held that the actual notice provision did not bind the protestors to the prior injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant county board of supervisors appealed a stipulated judgment of the Ventura County Superior Court, California, in favor of plaintiffs, county officials of public safety agencies. The judgment upheld the validity of sections 4 and 5 of initiative Ordinance No. 4088, prescribing minimum future annual budgets for county public safety agencies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that sections 4 and 5 of the ordinance seriously impaired the exercise of the board's essential governmental function of managing the county's financial affairs. The sections usurped the board's exclusive statutory power to adopt a budget by depriving it of the discretion to provide a lower level of funding. The court noted that county budgets for public safety agencies were a matter of statewide concern, as such budgets involved use of state funds. The board would have no discretion to decrease public safety funding if the crime rate plummeted, if improved efficiency or innovations reduced public safety costs, or if the required level of public safety funding prevented the county from adequately funding state mandated programs unrelated to public safety. In enacting Gov. Code, &sect;&sect; 29000- 29093, the legislature intended that the authority to adopt budgets for county public safety agencies be exercised specifically and exclusively by the board of supervisors, barring use of the local initiative power. Therefore, sections 4 and 5 of the ordinance exceeded the initiative power of the electorate and were constitutionally invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed that portion of the judgment upholding the validity of sections 4 and 5 of the ordinance, but affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

Reg. 4400, on the basis of extensive construction in common areas. Thereafter, the agency administrator filed a rent decrease petition purporting to act on behalf of all tenants in the building. The trial court rejected the landlord's challenge to the validity of the regulation as applied. On appeal, the court found that the agency exceeded its authority under the governing ordinance, Santa Monica, Cal., City Charter, art. XVIII, Rent Control, &sect; 1800 et seq., by filing on behalf of tenants who had not initiated a complaint on their own. The ordinance did not give the agency the power to initiate individual petitions. As to petitions filed by individual tenants, the court held that the agency, in enacting the challenged regulation, did not intrude upon judicial power in violation of Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1. The agency reasonably sought to enforce the ordinance by preventing landlords from depriving tenants of common area facilities. Because common areas were left in a dilapidated, unsafe, and unusable condition for lengthy periods while no work was performed, the rent decreases were justified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed with respect to the petition initiated by the agency and directed the trial court to issue a writ compelling the agency to set aside its order adopting the hearing officer's decision with regard to that petition and to enter a new and different order reversing the hearing officer's decision with regard to that petition only. The court affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff construction company brought suit against defendant city and county, challenging the constitutionality of the city's Minority/Women/Local Business Utilization Ordinance. The Superior Court of San Francisco County, California, granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The construction company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The construction company's primary work involved the installation of road and freeway signage, and in other public works. The company bid to install additional signage at the airport. In rejecting the construction company's bid, the project manager wrote that the company failed to list minority or women subcontractors in the bid. The company had since submitted other bids for projects that were cancelled. The company was currently awaiting further opportunities to submit bids. The company alleged that the ordinance's provisions violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 31. The appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in concluding that the company did not face a concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent, invasion of a legally protected interest. Moreover, the controversy was sufficiently concrete and definite for a judicial determination. The company was not required to identify a contract on which it intended to bid in the near future to demonstrate standing. Finally, the company's challenges were not purely facial, and the company had alleged an ongoing constitutional violation; therefore, the claims were not barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court reversed the judgment, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff challengers sued defendants, the California Governor, Secretary of State, Assembly, and Senate, alleging that the 2001 reapportionment of Santa Clara's assembly districts violated the California Constitution. The Superior Court of Sacramento County, California, held that the reapportionment plan enacted by the legislature was entitled to judicial deference and that the challengers failed to establish constitutional invalidity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs claimed that the division of Santa Clara into two districts violated Cal. Const., art. XXI, &sect; 1, subd. (e). The court disagreed, explaining that art. XXI, &sect; 1, subd. (e), provided great discretion to the legislature and plainly did not prohibit division of a city into different legislative districts. A reapportionment plan enacted by the legislature and approved by the Governor was entitled to significant judicial deference, and plaintiffs did not meet their burden of demonstrating a total and fatal conflict between the plan and art. XXI, &sect; 1. The fact that Santa Clara was not divided in a draft plan did not condemn the plan that was enacted. The legislature could adopt a reapportionment plan that minimized the chance of a challenge based on the Voting Rights Act without proving that the alternative necessarily would violate the Act. The court also held that: (1) the issue was justiciable; (2) the challengers were not entitled to depose the senior consultant to the Assembly's office of majority services because court inquiry into the subjective motivations of members of the legislature was precluded; and (3) the trial court's statement of decision was not inadequate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the loans were made, the state reduced processing payments and handling fees to the recycling center operators.

Refund values and processor administrative fees under former Pub. Resources Code, &sect; 14580, subd. (a)(1), were not impacted by the loans. Processing fee revenue from manufacturers under former Pub. Resources Code, &sect; 14581, subd. (a)(7)(B), also continued to be appropriated to processing payments. The budget bill loans did not convert the regulatory processing fees imposed under Pub. Resources Code, &sect;&sect; 14518.5, 14573, subd. (a)(3), 14573.5, subd. (a)(3), 14575, subd.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner employee challenged respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Board's (WCAB) reliance upon the medical-legal report of her employer's psychologist in denying petitioner's claim for workers' compensation benefits for an alleged psychiatric injury (stress), as not constituting substantial evidence, and further challenged Cal. Lab. Code &sect;3208.3(b)(1) as violative of equal protection. The court affirmed, holding that even though petitioner's psychiatrist opined petitioner was able to continue working despite her personal problems prior to a shift in management at her work; the opinion of the employer's psychologist, that work stress was not responsible for at least 51 percent of petitioner's psychiatric injury, constituted substantial evidence in support of respondent's decision. The court further hold that Cal. Lab. Code &sect;3208.3(b)(1), establishing the test of predominance for psychiatric injury claim, was a permissible exercise of legislative power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed, holding respondent Workers' Compensation Appeals Board's (WCAB) finding that the predominant cause of petitioner's psychiatric injury was nonindustrial in nature was based upon solid, credible evidence, and that requiring petitioner to meet a higher threshold of compensability for entitlement was rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county fair ejected respondent patron for refusing to remove his vest bearing a motorcycle club insignia. His Government Claims Act claim got rejected. He sued under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 51(b), and Cal. Const. art. 1, &sect; 2, enforceable through a Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 52.1(b) action for damages. The Sonoma County Superior Court (California) awarded him damages and attorney fees. Appellant county sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The fair had a dress code against provocative apparel and &quot;gang insignia.&quot; The trial court dismissed the city as a party, as it had not adopted the dress code. The appellate court found that, as the &sect; 51(b) claim derived from common law principles, and as the &sect; 52.1(b) claim sounded in tort, they were subject to the Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 340 one-year statute of limitations. But the Government Claims Act extended the limitations beyond the one-year. Enforcement of the dress code did not deprive the patron of full and equal access to accommodations in violation of the Unruh Act. The legislature intended to confine the scope of the Unruh Act to types of discrimination it listed. Any judicial expansion of coverage was to be done carefully, subject to a three-step inquiry. The dress code was, however, void for vagueness and facially overbroad, and its enforcement against the patron deprived him of his Due Process Clause liberty interest in personal dress and appearance. The definition of &quot;gang,&quot; in general, was notoriously imprecise. The dress code did not contain ascertainable standards. There was no showing that wearing of such insignia would lead to violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The portion of the judgment finding that the patron was denied free and equal access to the fair, in violation of the Unruh Act, was reversed. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On a petition by plaintiff, the People, the Superior Court of Alameda County, California, recommitted defendant as a mentally retarded person who was a danger to herself and others to a locked facility for one year. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal held that it did not violate Fourteenth Amendment equal protection principles to extend defendant's commitment for one year, even though, if her first commitment hearing had been held on or after July 1, 2012, rather than in 2008, she could only have been committed for six months, and only if she were found to be both dangerous and in acute crisis. No constitutional violation arose from the new statutory scheme envisioned by the prospective 2012 revisions to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 6500. Equal protection considerations will not preclude the legislative branch from prescribing experimental programs. The Legislature has a rational interest in limiting the potential costs of its experiment, and prospective application is reasonably related to that goal. It was neither irrational nor unconstitutional for the Legislature to proceed cautiously with respect to the release of developmentally disabled persons who had already been adjudicated to be dangerous to themselves or others and judicially placed in regional center facilities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A recommitment trial was delayed until the two-year period had almost expired, and the People were allowed to consolidate petitions to extend the SVP commitment for two successive two-year terms. A mistrial occurred. The trial court denied motions to dismiss on the ground of excessive pretrial delay. The court stated that the trial court failed to engage in a nuanced balancing process necessary to resolve the procedural due process claim. The court determined that the liberty interest involved was very significant, that the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used was considerable, and that the state had an interest in confining SVPs only when a person was actually determined under Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 6604, to be an SVP. Lengthy delays in SVP proceedings, such as a year in custody after a mistrial, could not be excused by systemic problems. The court further held that the trial court's retroactive order of indeterminate commitment was improper because Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect;&sect; 6604, 6604.1, did not authorize an order imposing an indeterminate term of commitment retroactive to the date of a first commitment as an SVP under previous law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss the consolidated recommitment petitions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners were four registered sex offender parolees subject to Pen. Code, &sect; 3003.5, subd. (b), a provision setting forth restrictions on where certain sex offenders subject to lifetime registration requirements may reside. Petitioners filed unified petitions for habeas corpus seeking to temporarily and permanently enjoin enforcement of the statute against them as a condition of parole. The court issued orders to show cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that petitioners' retroactivity and ex post facto claims, common to all four petitioners, could be addressed on the record before it, and that they lacked merit. Enforcing &sect; 3003.5, subd. (b)'s residency restrictions against petitioners was a prospective, not a retrospective, application of that law. Petitioners' remaining constitutional claims - that the statute was an unreasonable, vague and overbroad parole condition that infringed on a number of their fundamental constitutional rights - presented more complex &quot;as applied&quot; challenges to the enforcement of the new residency restrictions in the respective jurisdictions to which each petitioner had been paroled. Petitioners were not all similarly situated with regard to their paroles. Petitioners had been paroled to different cities and counties within the state, and the extent of housing in compliance with &sect; 3003.5, subd. (b), available to them during their terms of parole - a matter critical to deciding the merits of their as applied constitutional challenges - was not factually established. Evidentiary hearings would have to be conducted to establish the relevant facts necessary to decide each claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition for writ of habeas corpus and orders to show cause previously issued with regard to each petitioner's remaining constitutional claims were transferred to the appropriate appellate courts with directions that each matter be transferred to the trial court in the county to which each petitioner had been paroled for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) (California), and defendants, a provider of parking services and related individuals, appealed from a judgment of the San Francisco County Superior Court (California) in CCSF's enforcement action to collect parking tax arrearages. The trial court held that the parking tax violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(a) and reduced the provider's arrearages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court agreed with the provider that the parking tax violated the state's guarantee of equal protection. The court disagreed, finding rational bases for the exemptions for long-term parking by members of the military and for parking by registered hotel guests and apartment residents. The trial court properly reduced the provider's arrearages to eliminate amounts derived from the provider's valet parking activities where no fee was paid by the provider for space used to park vehicles. Under the express provisions of the ordinance, the provider was not liable for any tax unless, with respect to each transaction sought to be taxed, CCSF proved that rent was paid. The parking tax did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(a), or amount to an improper double tax on real estate in violation of Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1. The court agreed with the trial court that the portion of the parking tax earmarked for senior citizens' activities was void as a special tax that did not receive the requisite two-thirds approval by the voters as required by Cal. Const. art. XIIIA, &sect; 4. The offending clause was severable under the ordinance's savings clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court to enter a new judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner city sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeal of California, Second Appellate District, Division Three, which agreed with respondent superior court that real party in interest defendant was entitled to information in certain police officers' personnel files. The city contended that the information was not subject to discovery, because it fell outside the scope of Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1045, subd. (b)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was charged with molesting a minor, he sought the discovery of information in the police officers' records. The superior court reviewed the materials in chambers and held that defendant was entitled to obtain this information. The appellate court upheld the order, and found that is was necessary to protect defendant's right to a fair trial. On appeal, the court reversed. The court rejected the argument that Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1045(b)(1) violated defendant's right to due process. The five-year limitation on court-ordered discovery did not, on its face, violate due process. The court found no principle of justice that was offended by the statute's prohibition against disclosing citizen complaints of officer misconduct that were filed more than five years before the proceeding. The material at issue was not subject to disclosure, as it fell short of the constitutionally materiality standard. Furthermore, the material was not discoverable under &sect; 1045(b)(1), as the material was more than five years old. The superior court's order directing the police agency to disclose all relevant files was improper, and the appellate court erred in affirming the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The measure provided exemptions for some senior and disabled taxpayers. It also imposed different tax rates on residential and commercial/industrial properties, as well as different rates on commercial/industrial properties of different sizes. The court concluded that the property classifications and differential tax burdens exceeded the district's taxing authority under Gov. Code, &sect; 50079, to impose qualified special taxes as provided in Cal. Const., art. XIII A, &sect; 4, and Gov. Code, &sect;&sect; 50075, 53722. Section 50079 did not authorize school districts to impose special taxes that classified and differentially taxed property within the district. Thus, the property classifications and differential tax burdens were unauthorized under Gov. Code, &sect; 53727, subd. (a), and were invalid. The court determined that the invalid provisions could be severed because their absence left a coherent, functioning tax measure that substantially reflected voter expectations. The exemptions for senior and disabled taxpayers, although available only to taxpayers who owned and resided in single family units, were valid exceptions to the uniformity requirement of &sect; 50079.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed as to the property classifications and differential tax burdens, affirmed with regard to the exemptions for senior and disabled taxpayers, and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In coordinated cases, appellants, three counties, two boards of retirement, and numerous individual plan members, sought review of a judgment from the San Francisco County Superior Court (California), which ruled that the retirement boards had discretion to collect arrears beyond the limitations period and that all cash remuneration, but not all non-cash payments to employees, had to be included in calculating final compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court gave retroactive application to a state supreme court decision that overruled a court of appeal in holding that compensation paid in cash, even if not earned by all employees in the same grade or class, had to be included in the compensation earnable and final compensation on which an employee's pension under the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31450 et seq., was based. The court affirmed, finding that the retirement boards and counties had not relied on the ruling of a court of last resort, but on the construction of a statute by a court of appeal. Accordingly, a narrow exception to the general rule of retroactivity, based on the making of contracts in reliance on the interpretation of a statute by a court of last resort, did not apply. Until each retirement board exercised its discretion to correct miscalculations, the court could not determine whether it had abused its discretion. Termination pay received upon retirement was excludable in calculating pension benefits under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31462.1. Insurance premiums, as in-kind benefits, were not compensation under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 31460; neither were employer-paid contributions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner employees sought mandate relief from an order of respondent Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted summary adjudication to real party in interest employer on the employees' cause of action seeking damages under Lab. Code, &sect; 226.7, for failure to provide second meal periods under Lab. Code, &sect; 512, subd. (a), and &sect; 10(B) of Industrial Welfare Commission wage order No. 16-2001, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 8, &sect; 11160.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees alleged that they were covered by the wage order and that they were entitled to second meal periods because they worked at least 10 hours per day. Based on its understanding of case law prospectively invalidating &sect; 10(E) of the wage order, which had provided that there was an exemption from the second meal period requirement for employees covered by certain collective bargaining agreements, the superior court ruled that the employer could not be liable for damages under &sect; 226.7 because it was in compliance with the wage order as written. The court observed that &sect; 19 of the wage order contained a severability clause. Consequently, the invalid provision was not an operative part of the wage order at the time of the trial court's decision. Because it was void ab initio, the invalid provision did not immunize the employer from the consequences of its actions. In light of an amendment to Lab. Code, &sect; 514, and the limits imposed on wage orders by Lab. Code, &sect; 516, the employer was on notice that it was required to provide second meal periods, and there was nothing unfair about requiring the employer to provide compensation for its failure to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the petition and issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate the summary adjudication order, to enter a new order denying summary adjudication, and to conduct further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owner appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Sonoma County (California), which upheld a determination by respondent county's board of supervisors that a subdivision map submitted by the owner did not qualify as a valid map under Gov. Code, &sect; 66499.30, subd. (d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A previous owner of the property obtained approval of a subdivision map in 1915 and recorded the map, but the lots were never sold separately. The court concluded that the owner was not entitled to a certificate of compliance under Gov. Code, &sect; 66499.35, subd. (a), because the regulatory statutes in effect in 1915 did not regulate the design and improvement of subdivisions, within the meaning of &sect; 66499.30, subd. (d). Although the 1915 statutes regulated the location and width of roads, they did not address other aspects of design as set forth in Gov. Code, &sect; 66418. Because there was no mention of any infrastructure other than roads in the 1915 statutes, they did not regulate improvement as defined in Gov. Code, &sect; 66419. The court further held that the owner's claims of due process violations lacked merit because the denial of a certificate of compliance was a ministerial action, not a legislative act; there was no substantial evidence that ex parte communications occurred; and a deputy county counsel who advised both the county's permit and resources agency and the county's board of supervisors was not also acting as an advocate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action against defendant university regents to establish his eligibility for pension fund benefits, plaintiff professor moved for an award of attorney fees and costs pursuant to Lab. Code, &sect; 218.5. The San Diego County Superior Court, California, denied the motion, concluding that wage and benefit matters were internal university affairs not subject to state regulation. The professor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded the regents was constitutionally immune from the reach of &sect; 218.5, and that the American rule applied, under which each party bore its own attorney fees. The regents was an arm of the state, and there was no suggestion the California Legislature sought to impose the statute on the regents. This action against the regents arose out of its status as a public employer, and the subject matter of a suit giving rise to attorney fees under &sect; 218.5 pertained to the regents's internal affairs not subject to state regulation. It would have been incongruous to saddle the regents with the other side's attorney fees in an action arising from wages and benefits. Forcing the regents to use public funds in that manner was unwarranted under the state's police power. The determination of whether to pay the professor's fees was within the regents's broad constitutional grant of authority to manage its own internal affairs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which upheld Proposition E, a ballot initiative that the voters in the city approved by a majority vote and which invalidated as unconstitutional a key provision of a second ballot measure, Proposition F, that the voters also approved by a slimmer majority vote margin in the same election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Proposition E, the San Diego Taxpayer Protection Act of 2000, amended the city charter to require voter approval by a two-thirds super majority margin of any new general tax or any increase in an existing general tax to be levied by the city council. Proposition F sought to amend the charter by retroactively requiring that any amendment requiring a super majority vote would itself have to be adopted by a super majority vote. The court held that the provisions of Proposition F requiring a super majority vote of the electorate for approval of certain amendments to the charter were invalid because they conflicted with Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3(a), which provided that only a majority vote was required to amend a city charter in California. The provisions of Proposition F requiring a super majority vote for certain charter amendments were preempted by state law, despite the absence of a state statute. Proposition E was invalid and not reformable because its provisions requiring a super majority two-thirds vote for approval of any new general tax or any increase in an existing general tax conflicted with Cal. Const. art. XIII C, &sect; 2(b) and Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the portion of the judgment in favor of plaintiff taxpayers on their complaints challenging Proposition F and reversed the portion of the judgment in their favor on the city's cross-complaints challenging Proposition E. The court remanded the matter with instructions to vacate the judgment and enter a new judgment that was consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

Proc., &sect; 425.16, the anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) statute, the Superior Court of Monterey County, California, dismissed a claim against defendant city for misuse of public funds. The judgment was affirmed on appeal. The trial court denied plaintiffs' motion for attorney fees under the private attorney general statute and granted the city's motion for fees under &sect; 425.16. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court of appeal held that plaintiffs, supporters of a ballot measure that would have repealed the city's utility tax, were not entitled to attorney fees under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1021.5, the private attorney general statute, because they were not successful in their misuse-of-public-funds suit, given that they obtained no relief and that their lawsuit was found to have no merit. The fact that the court accepted part of their legal analysis did not change that result. The court also held that the award of fees to the city was proper under the anti-SLAPP statute.&nbsp;Section 425.16, subd. (c), was not an unconstitutional infringement of the right of petition when applied in cases against the government. The government had an interest in speaking out on issues of public concern and in being free of the costs of defending meritless lawsuits aimed at infringing the government's free-speech activities. Section 425.16, subd. (c), protected the government's interests by shifting the cost of defending such suits to the plaintiff. Any chill to legitimate petitioning activity was merely incidental to and outweighed by the significant governmental interests the statute was designed to protect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's order granting the city's motion for attorney fees and denying plaintiffs' motion for attorney fees was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant adult ward appealed an order of the Superior Court of Riverside County, California, for a two-year extension of his commitment to the California Youth Authority (CYA) under Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 1800 et seq., California's juvenile Extended Detention Act (EDA). Defendant's original commitment to the CYA began when he was 14 years old. In the commitment offense, defendant molested an eight-year-old victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court noted that a clinical psychologist with CYA who conducted the &sect; 1800 psychological evaluation of defendant stated her opinion that he was physically dangerous and would not be able to control his behavior. She also performed a risk analysis showing a well-founded risk defendant would reoffend and tied that risk to his diagnosed disorders. Moreover, defendant had an extensive history of acting on his fantasies while committed. Thus, the evidence amply supported the jury's findings, pursuant to Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, &sect; 1801.5, that defendant's mental disorder caused him serious difficulty in controlling his dangerous behavior and that the risk of reoffense was a result of a mental disorder. The trial court's admonition to the jury was sufficient to cure any prejudice from prosecutorial misconduct. With respect to the procedures by which extended commitments were initiated, wards of the CYA were not similarly situated to sexually violent predators or mentally disordered offenders. The EDA required continuing treatment for wards and therefore did not violate equal protection. Accordingly, defendant's extended detention under the EDA did not violate substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner brought an original mandate proceeding in the California Supreme Court seeking to stay a general election for the office of county district attorney and to direct respondent county officials to hold a special election pursuant to Elec. Code, &sect; 8026. The matter was transferred to the court of appeals for expedited review. A stay was denied. The election results were sealed pending adjudication of the writ proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The incumbent district attorney, who was a candidate in a two-person race for reelection, died less than 68 days before the scheduled general election. The court chose to exercise its discretion under Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 1085, to hear the petition instead of remanding the matter to the trial court for a hearing and initial adjudication because there were no relevant disputed factual issues and the petition raised a significant question of statewide importance. The court concluded that &sect; 8026 applied to all elections, including general elections, when a candidate in a two-person, nonpartisan, nonjudicial contest involving an incumbent died within 68 days of the date set for the election. Because &sect; 8026 referred to a more specific set of circumstances, it controlled over Elec. Code, &sect; 15402, which generally provided for elections to proceed despite the death of one of the candidates. It did not matter whether the election before which an incumbent candidate or challenger died was a primary or general election. Although voting officials in some counties had interpreted Elec.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The two actions underlying the consolidated appeals arose from the state budget impasses in 1997 and 1998. In the first action, an individual sought declaratory relief regarding the conduct of state officials during the budget impasse in 1997, and demurrers to the individual's complaint were sustained. In the second action, a taxpayers association sought injunctive relief barring the Controller for California from issuing warrants prior to the passage of a budget in 1998, and the trial court issued an injunction. On review, the appellate court concluded that, absent a budget act or emergency appropriation, the Controller could disburse funds pursuant to: (1) continuing appropriations found in statutes and other provisions of law; (2) Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 4, and Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 8.5 of the California Constitution; (3) the Federal Labor Standards Act; and (4) the federal Food Stamp program, Foster Care and Adoption programs, Child Support program, and the Child Welfare Services program.</SPAN></P>

Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 360.6, ordered the minor removed from his foster home, and placed in a pre-adoptive home on a Chippewa reservation. The appellant foster parents appealed. A petition for supersedeas was granted, and counsel for the minor was appointed, who filed a respondent's brief in favor of reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor and his foster parents had bonded, since he was three months old, and anticipated adoption. Although it received notice under &sect; 360.6 and ICWA, the minor's mother's tribe, with whom she had little contact, did not do anything until a year later, when it stated it would not intervene. Later, the tribe intervened and advocated placement with an extended family member, which was the basis of the trial court's decision. The appellate court held that ICWA violated the Fifth, Tenth, and Fourteenth Amendments as applied, but not on its face. Native-American ancestry, based upon a quantum of Indian blood, was a suspect ancestry classification. ICWA served a significant governmental interest in preserving tribal culture, which was not served by removing the assimilated minor from his de facto family. ICWA was not narrowly tailored to protect the best interests of this Indian child or to promote stability and security of Indian families where there was no Indian family to preserve. ICWA and &sect; 360.6 violated the Tenth Amendment. By its delay, and statement that it would not intervene, the tribe waived assertion of ICWA placement preferences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's placement order was reversed. The writ of supersedeas was dissolved, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury convicted defendant of two counts of voluntary manslaughter and one count of attempted voluntary manslaughter. The trial court sentenced defendant to an upper term of 11 years on one of the voluntary manslaughter counts. The California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Four, affirmed the trial court's imposition of the upper term sentence. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The People had charged defendant with two counts of premeditated murder and one count of attempted premeditated murder, but the jury rejected the prosecution's view of the evidence. The court held that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated by the imposition of the upper term sentence. The court noted that the trial court cited the following circumstances as aggravating factors: (1) the crime involved a great amount of violence; (2) defendant engaged in callous behavior; (3) defendant lacked any concern regarding the consequences of her actions; (4) the victims were particularly vulnerable because they were unarmed, inebriated, and ambushed from behind; (5) defendant was the motivating force behind the crimes; and (6) defendant's actions reflected planning and premeditation. However, all of the aggravating circumstances cited by the trial court were based upon the facts underlying the crime; none were admitted by defendant or established by the jury's verdict. The error was not harmless. The court was not convinced that each of the aggravating circumstances cited by the trial court would have been found true by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court insofar as it affirmed the imposition of the upper term sentence and remanded the matter to that court with directions to remand the case to the trial court for resentencing. Upon remand, the trial court could exercise its discretion to impose any of the three terms available for defendant's offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded no contest to six counts of lewd and lascivious acts involving 14- and 15-year old victims at least 10 years younger than defendant in violation of Pen. Code, &sect; 288, subd. (c)(1). The Santa Clara County Superior Court, California, concluded that imposition of mandatory sex offender registration would violate equal protection and denied the People's request for such registration pursuant to Pen. Code, &sect; 290. The People appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that mandatory registration based upon a conviction of committing a lewd act with a 14- or 15-year-old in violation of &sect; 288, subd. (c)(1), violated equal protection, because had he engaged in unlawful, nonforcible sexual intercourse with the same victim and been convicted under Pen. Code, &sect; 261.5, subd. (d), he would not have been subject to mandatory registration. The instant court concluded that defendant did not show that he was subjected to differential treatment because of his convictions under &sect; 288, subd. (c)(1), and mandatory registration under &sect; 290. Defendant was not similarly situated with another group of convicted persons who received different treatment under the sex offender registration statute. Persons of the same age as defendant convicted of similar sex crimes were, like defendant, required to register as sex offenders. Because defendant failed to make a showing that the state adopted a classification that affected two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner, the trial court erred in finding that defendant was not subject to mandatory sex offender registration as a consequence of his convictions under &sect; 288, subd. (c)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The order was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court with instructions that it direct defendant to register as a sex offender in compliance with &sect; 290.</SPAN></P>
