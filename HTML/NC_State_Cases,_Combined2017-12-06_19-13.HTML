Laws 1605, 1618, involuntarily transferring appellant city's water system to a metropolitan district, violated N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24 because it was a local law crafted to only apply to the city without explaining why every other city was exempt or why its benefits should not be available to every municipal water system's customers; [2]-The legislation related to the prohibited subject of health and sanitation, contrary to N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24(1)(a), because its stated purpose was to provide water and sewer services to affected customers, and the fact that it changed the governance of the city's water system did not remove it from N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24(1)(a)'s prohibition, as a local act shifting responsibility for enforcing health and safety regulations from one entity to another clearly related to health and sanitation.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 15A-1235 (2013) was plain error review; [2]-Defendant failed to establish that the trial court plainly erred in its jury instructions because, through the course of three separate instructions, the trial court repeatedly emphasized to the jurors the importance of their individual convictions, while giving instructions that substantially tracked the language of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1235(b) (2013); [3]-The trial court's instructions did not result in an unconstitutional coercion of a deadlocked jury under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 24.</SPAN></P>

Consequently, defendant could not have been prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel when a double jeopardy argument, under U.S. Const. amend. V and N.C. Const. art.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-2 (Supp. 1974)--mandated the conclusion that he remained lawfully incarcerated because defendant remained lawfully incarcerated and was not entitled to release where the nature and severity of his offenses warranting the life sentence remained the same, the DOC retained the same implicit discretion in governing him pursuant to N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court held that while the companies had separated the bet element from the game of chance feature by offering free sweepstakes entries, the North Carolina legislature considered the sweepstakes systems to be the functional equivalent of gambling. Section 14-306.4 primarily regulated non-communicative conduct rather than protected speech. Section 14-306.4(b) (2011) made it unlawful for any person to operate, or place into operation, an electronic machine or device to conduct a sweepstakes through the use of an entertaining display. There was no speaker- or content-based restriction related to the sweepstakes result. The announcement of the winner was not protected speech as it was an incidental part of the non-communicative activity of conducting the sweepstakes. The statute was not overbroad as it concerned only with the attachment of an announcement of a sweepstakes result to the game, which created the functional equivalent of a gambling environment and encouraged the ills the legislature sought to remedy. Even if &sect; 14-306.4 burdened some speech, the First Amendment did not prevent restrictions directed at conduct from imposing incidental burdens on speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer, seeing that the right brake light of a vehicle did not come on when the vehicle slowed, stopped the vehicle.

The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, finding that the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the vehicle and driver were violating a law requiring properly functioning brake lights and that the seizure was thus constitutionally valid. The intermediate appellate court held that former N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-129 (2009) required only one brake light; as the driver was not violating the law, the stop was objectively unreasonable and violated defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV. Assuming without deciding that this interpretation of &sect; 20-129 was correct, the high court held that under the totality of the circumstances, the officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that &sect; 20-129 was being violated, and his mistake of law was objectively reasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant County adopted an adequate public facilities ordinance (APFO) that effectively conditioned the approval of new residential construction projects on developers paying a fee to subsidize new school construction. Plaintiff developer filed a declaratory judgment action, challenging the validity of the APFO. The trial court held that the APFO was invalid. The Court of Appeals (North Carolina) affirmed. The County appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the APFO, the County's Planning and Zoning Commission reviewed all proposed residential developments, except those located within two territorial jurisdictions, to determine if the new homes would exacerbate overcrowding in the County's two public schools systems. The Commission denied preliminary approval applications for a number of proposed developments based upon insufficient public school capacity. However, the County Board of Commissioners ultimately approved the developments on appeal once developers executed consent agreements designed to mitigate the impact of their developments on public school capacity. The County lacked the statutory authority to adopt the APFO pursuant to its general zoning powers under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 153A-4, 153A-340, and 153A-341 because the APFO was not a zoning ordinance. Rather, it impermissibly placed the burden of funding public school construction on developers by using a revenue generating mechanism that was disguised as a zoning ordinance. Furthermore, 2004 N.C. Sess. Laws 39, which was intended to address APFO enforcement concerns involving municipalities located within the County, did not authorize the enactment of the APFO.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving while impaired and reckless driving. She filed a motion to suppress, contending that the Campus Police Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 74G-1 to -13 (2009), violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by a campus police officer after she was stopped driving near a college campus. The Court of Appeals held that the Campus Police Act granted an unconstitutional delegation of discretionary power to a religious institution. The court considered defendant's Establishment Clause challenge to the Act using the three-part test of Lemon v. Kurtzman and concluded that the Act had a secular legislative purpose, as stated in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 74G-2(a). The college, a private liberal arts college affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (PC), was not a church and its primary purpose of secular education was not religious in nature. The potential influence of the PC over the college was minimal, as the church did not run or control the college and had no role in management or policy decisions. Because the campus police agency benefited the college's secular rather than religious activities, the statute did not give rise to excessive entanglement or have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-96(a)(2) (2009) made the parties get two percent of the votes for governor in the last election or the signatures of that number of voters. The supreme court held these requirements were not subject to strict scrutiny because they did not severely burden associational rights, as (1) minority parties seeking recognition had over three and one-half years to get the required signatures, (2) the statute put few restrictions on signatories, since they did not have to register with or promise to vote for candidates of the party seeking recognition, and could vote in a major party's primary, (3) a few supporters could get the required signatures, and (4) the requirements were readily achievable. They did not violate due process, free speech and assembly, and equal protection provisions in N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 12, 14, and 19 because they imposed a reasonable hurdle to ballot access, as (1) signatories were not disqualified for voting in another party's primary, (2) they were more permissive than requirements upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, and (3) they did not discriminate against minor parties or operate to freeze the political status quo of a two-party system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder in the Superior Court for Wayne County (North Carolina) and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed as of right to the supreme court. The supreme court remanded the case for further hearings, findings of fact, and conclusions of law. Following entry of an order on remand, the supreme court allowed defendant's motion for supplemental briefing following the remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by granting his motion to discharge appointed counsel and proceed pro se because the undisputed facts showed that, as articulated in Indiana v. Edwards, he came within the category of &quot;gray area&quot; or &quot;borderline competent&quot; defendants who were competent to stand trial but nonetheless lacked the capacity to conduct trial proceedings without the assistance of counsel. The supreme court disagreed. Defendant was able to respond to the trial court's inquiries in a manner that indicated that he: (1) understood the charges and proceedings against him and the range of possible punishments; (2) had been clearly advised of his right to counsel; and (3) appreciated the consequences of his decision to waive that right. Defendant's technical legal knowledge was not relevant to an assessment of his knowing exercise of the right to defend himself. Defendant was well aware of his limitations, and the record established that he knew what he was doing and his choice was made with eyes open.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of eleven counts of possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-415.1. The trial court entered judgment on one count, sentencing defendant to 18 to 22 months of imprisonment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the 2004 amendment to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-415.1 was an unconstitutional ex post facto law or alternatively, a bill of attainder. The court held that the trial court's judgment against defendant was not for any prior act but was consistent with defendant's possession of a firearm in 2006, over two years after &sect; 14-415.1 was amended to prohibit such action. In the strictest sense, defendant's conviction was for an offense that he committed after his actions were deemed criminal, namely the possession of any firearm by a felon. The court found that the statute was rationally related to the legislature's nonpunitive intent to protect the public from future violent actions of those it had deemed to have a heightened disregard of the law. The scope of the 2004 amendment was not excessive when compared with the purpose of protecting public safety. Because the prohibition of possession of firearms by felons did not operate as punishment on a selected group of persons without a judicial trial, &sect; 14-415.1 was not a bill of attainder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on five counts of felony serious injury by vehicle, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-141.4(a3) (2009), and one count of misdemeanor hit and run, but was found not guilty of driving while impaired, in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-138.1. The Court of Appeals (North Carolina) vacated the judgments. The State sought discretionary review pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-31.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of the greater offense of felony serious injury by vehicle but acquitted of the lesser offense of driving while impaired. While the verdicts were certainly inconsistent, they were not mutually exclusive. Because the case presented nothing more than mere inconsistency, defendant was not entitled to relief. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-141.4(a3) did not require a conviction of driving while impaired under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 20-138.1 or -138.2, but only required a finding that the defendant was engaged in the conduct described under either of these offenses. There was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support defendant's convictions for felony serious injury by vehicle under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-141.4(a3). Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in vacating the convictions. Further, the Court of Appeals erred in vacating the portion of the judgment ordering defendant to pay restitution. While the mere presentation of a worksheet was not sufficient to support the award of restitution, any error in the determination of restitution was not prejudicial to defendant because defendant would pay the lesser of the actual amount owed or the amount ordered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of assignments of error not addressed in that court's initial opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants each pleaded guilty to multiple counts of taking indecent liberties with a child. All of the offenses occurred before the SBM statutes took effect. Defendants disputed their eligibility for SBM, arguing that their participation would have violated guarantees against ex post fact laws contained in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. However, the SBM program was enacted with the intent to create a civil, regulatory scheme to protect citizens of North Carolina from the threat posed by the recidivist tendencies of convicted sex offenders. In examining the relevant Mendoza-Martinez factors in detail, the appellate court concluded that neither the purpose nor effect of the SBM program negated the legislature's civil intent. Accordingly, the SBM program was not intended to be criminal punishment and was not punitive in purpose or effect, and subjecting defendants to the SBM program did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the state or federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

The school officials suspended the student for the remainder of the school year without offering her alternative education. The court determined that an intermediate scrutiny, rather than strict scrutiny or the rational basis test, should apply to disciplinary decisions involving denial of alternative education to a student on long-term suspension because exclusion from alternative education potentially infringed on the student's state constitutional right to equal educational access. Under the intermediate scrutiny, school administrators were required to articulate a reason when they excluded a long-term suspended student from alternative education.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of murder and was sentenced to death. The appellate court later vacated the death sentence and, on remand, petitioner was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. Over 30 years later, the trial court concluded that petitioner was entitled to be awarded good time, gain time, and merit time by the DOC, including calculation of his date of unconditional release. Further, the trial court found that petitioner had served the entirety of the sentence imposed and was entitled to release. However, the DOC's interpretation that petitioner's good time, gain time, and merit time credits were not awarded to him for purposes of unconditional release was statutorily and constitutionally permissible. The fact that petitioner was serving a sentence for first-degree murder reasonably suggested that he presented a greater threat to society than other prisoners. Thus, the DOC had a rational basis for denying petitioner good time, gain time, and merit time for the purposes of unconditional release, even though these same credits had been awarded for that purpose to other prisoners with determinate sentences convicted under statutes other than N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of, inter alia, felony murder, conspiracy to commit murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and felonious breaking or entering, larceny, and conspiracy to commit breaking or entering and larceny. The case was remanded for resentencing. The Superior Court, Halifax County (North Carolina) denied defendant's motion to bifurcate the sentencing proceeding. The supreme court granted defendant's petition for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2005(e) (2009) did not explicitly prohibit a trial court from submitting the special issue of mental retardation to the jury in a bifurcated, rather than unitary, capital sentencing proceeding, the supreme court held that such a determination was left to the sound discretion of the trial judges. The plain language of &sect; 15A-2005 indicated that the jury would make two separate determinations, at two distinct points during the sentencing proceeding: first, on the special issue of mental retardation, and next, only if defendant was found not to be mentally retarded, the sentence to be imposed. By mandating that a jury first consider and answer the special issue on mental retardation, the supreme court concluded that &sect; 15A-2005(c) does not preclude a bifurcated proceeding, but rather contemplated that only after completing and returning a &quot;not mentally retarded &quot;verdict on the first issue could a jury consider evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors. Before denying defendant's motion, the trial judge hear extensive argument from both sides. Nothing in the record indicated that trial court's decision was arbitrary or unsupported by reason.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The industrial commission awarded plaintiff employee workers' compensation. Defendant employer appealed. The Court of Appeals (North Carolina) vacated the award on the grounds that the commissioner was without authority because his successor had been appointed. The employee appealed, arguing that the commissioner was authorized under N.C. Const. art. VI, &sect; 10 and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 128-7 because the successor had not yet taken the oath of office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner, an appointed public officer, was notified that his service as a commissioner was at an end and that his successor had been appointed. After receiving the notification letter, but before the successor commissioner had taken the oath of office, the commissioner sat on a three-person panel, heard the employee's case, and awarded the benefits. Under N.C. Const. art. VI, &sect; 10, the commissioner held his position until his successor was chosen and qualified. Moreover, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 128-7, the commissioner was required to continue in his office until his successor was elected or appointed, and duly qualified. Pursuant to N.C. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7 and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 11-7, the newly appointed successor was required to take the oath of office before he was qualified to assume the commissioner's duties. The General Assembly expanded on the constitutional provisions to require that a public servant swear an oath before taking office, and to ensure that the office was not vacated during any delay between the appointment of a successor and his lawful entry into office upon becoming qualified by taking the oath.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the court of appeals' opinion and remanded the matter to that court for consideration of the substantive issues raised in the employer's appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery with a dangerous weapon and first-degree murder under the felony murder rule, a violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17. The trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment without parole for the felony murder and to a consecutive term of 103 to 133 months for the robbery. The Court of Appeals (North Carolina) affirmed. Defendant appealed, raising a violation of N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court informed jurors of two elements of felony murder and instructed them on the underlying felonies of burglary and robbery with a dangerous weapon. In its jury charge, the trial court only recited the first portion of the part of the North Carolina Pattern Jury Instruction that explained what the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction of felony murder. The trial court did not explicitly include a reference to the effect that defendant was the killer, or that defendant's acts were the proximate cause of the victim's death. While use of the pattern instructions was encouraged, it was not required. The trial court's instruction mirrored the definition of felony murder. The error was not structural, and the harmless error standard was applied. In light of the overwhelming evidence that defendant caused the victim's death, even if the trial court's instructions were erroneous, any error was harmless. Even if the jurors had received the complete pattern instruction for felony murder, there was no reasonable probability that outcome would have been different.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a county school board and superintendent, sought review of a decision from the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which reversed the dismissal of plaintiffs, students and parents, state constitutional claim against the board, the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim against the superintendent in her individual capacity, for alleged violations of his procedural due process rights, and the dismissal of the claim concerning the board's gang policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The students and parents alleged that the board and superintendent subjected minority students to more severe disciplinary measures for less serious offenses than white students including suspensions without due process of law and labeling minority students as gang affiliated. With regard to the state constitutional claims against the board, the court found that under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 115C-45(c) and 391(e), the students always had the statutory right to appeal; thus, the complaint's allegation that the students were never given that opportunity failed. Thus, an adequate remedy existed at state law to redress the alleged injury, and the direct constitutional claim was barred. As to the &sect; 1983 claim against the superintendent, the court held that the students could show no claim under &sect; 1983 for violation of procedural due process when their own allegations revealed that the students and the parents failed to avail themselves of the due process offered under state law. The allegations in the complaint did not demonstrate how a meeting between a student with his mother and school representatives violated the students' right to procedural due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the appeals court's decision and affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the single student's claims, and left undisturbed the appeals court's decision to reversed and remand for additional proceedings as to the issue of the gang policy, despite finding that discretionary review was improvidently allowed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder. Following the convictions, the trial court declared a mistrial as to the penalty proceedings. New counsel was appointed and a different jury returned a binding recommendation that defendant be sentenced to death. Appeal was taken as of right pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-27(a) from the judgments imposing a death sentence entered in Superior Court Cumberland County (North Carolina).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in not removing an attorney as his counsel or by not holding a hearing to determine whether there was a conflict of interest between defendant and the attorney. In the absence of a request for the appointment of substitute counsel, the trial court was not required to hold any hearing. Any potential conflict that existed between defendant and the attorney would not have been apparent to the trial court, such as to compel the trial court to ex mero motu conduct a hearing on the matter. Defendant was not entitled to file pro se motions while represented by counsel and the trial court did not err in refusing to rule on defendant's pro se speedy trial motion. The trial court did not lack jurisdiction to enter a judgment sentencing defendant to death. While N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(a) did envision the same trial judge presiding over a defendant's guilt phase and penalty proceeding, the statute also envisioned the proceeding being held immediately or soon after the defendant was found guilty of a capital offense. Such a scenario was impossible in the instant case because of defendant's unprovoked attack on one of his attorneys.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no error in defendant's convictions or sentences.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 115C-431(c) (2007), seeking funding for school operations. A jury found that the school board needed $ 10,200,000, and the trial court entered a judgment requiring the commission to appropriate that amount to the school board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission alleged that by allowing the court system to decide the level of funding for public education, &sect; 115C-431(c) impermissibly delegated the legislature's constitutional duty under N.C. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(1), to provide for a general and uniform system of free public schools. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 115C-431(c), finding that the legislature had merely delegated to the courts the fact-finding duty of determining the cost of the scheme exhaustively defined by the legislature, which was a proper role of the judiciary. However, the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the definition of &quot;needed&quot; in &sect; 115C-431(c). A restrictive definition was necessary to preserve the discretionary authority of county commissions under article IX, &sect; 2(2). The jury could consider the educational policies of the state, the budgetary request of the local board, the financial resources of the county, and the fiscal policies of the commissioners, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 115C-426(e) (2007). Anything beyond this measure of damages impermissibly infringed upon the discretionary authority of the county commission and could not be awarded by a jury.</SPAN></P>

The General Assembly gave residents in District 10C one-fifth, or 20 percent, of the voting power of residents in District 10A. Residents of Districts 10B and 10D had one-fourth, or 25 percent, of the voting power of residents in District 10A. The supreme court held that the Equal Protection Clause, N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, applied to the creation of an additional judgeship in District 10A. The right to vote in superior court elections on substantially equal terms was a quasi-fundamental right subject to a heightened level of scrutiny. Plaintiffs demonstrated gross disparity in voting power between similarly situated residents. Residents of District 10A had a voting power roughly five times greater than residents of District 10C, four and a half times greater than residents of District 10B, and four times greater than residents of District 10D. The trial court did not err in admitting an exhibit attached to an affidavit. It admitted the evidence in its discretion under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 803(8) (2007) and made findings of fact based on trustworthy information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause to the court of appeals for further remand to the trial court with orders to hold a new hearing and determine whether the State could meet its burden of demonstrating significant interests that justified the legislature's subdivisions within District 10 and to show that the disparity in voter strength was not substantially greater than necessary to accommodate those interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff gun owner challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which affirmed an order granting defendant State summary judgment in the owner's action alleging that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-415.1, as amended in 2004, violated his rights under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 30.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner pleaded guilty to felony possession with intent to sell and deliver a controlled substance in 1979. His civil rights were fully restored in 1987. In 2004, he General Assembly amended &sect; 14-415.1 to prohibit the possession of all firearms by an person convicted of any felon. The supreme court held that the application of &sect; 14-415.1, as amended in 2004, to the owner violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 30. Pursuant to &sect; 14-415.1, the State unreasonably divested the owner of his right to own a firearm, and such action violated his right to keep and bear arms. The State did not argue that any aspect of the owner's crime involved violence or the threat of violence. The owner completed his sentence without incident in 1982. His right to possess firearms was restored in 1987. No evidence was presented indicating that he was dangerous or had ever misused firearms. The owner affirmatively demonstrated that he was not among the class of citizens who posed a threat to public peace and safety. As applied to the owner, the 2004 version of &sect; 14-451.1 was an unreasonable regulation, not fairly related to the preservation of public peace and safety.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his capital conviction to the court, which allowed his motion to bypass the Court of Appeals as to his other convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce evidence that defendant killed another woman in 1997. The court found no error in the trial court's ruling that the evidence of the first death was admissible for purposes of showing defendant's knowledge, plan, opportunity, intent, modus operandi, and motive to kill the second woman. The court also rejected defendant's arguments as to the admissibility of other evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel. At sentencing, defense counsel unsuccessfully requested an instruction that, should the jurors find defendant mentally retarded, he would be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Remanding for sentencing, the court noted that defendant presented substantial evidence of mental retardation to the jury during the sentencing proceeding. The court determined that the requested instruction was proper under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2005 (2007). Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1443(a) (2007), the court further concluded that the error prejudiced defendant, noting that the jury found as mitigating circumstances many facts that would also tend to establish mental retardation on the part of defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that there was some inadmissible material in the exhibits. The court further held that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a mistrial, made when law enforcement officers approached the jury box to purportedly block the victim's mother from seeing autopsy photographs, as the trial court acted promptly and effectively to regain control of the courtroom and the court refused to second-guess the trial court to presume that the incident was fatally prejudicial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the North Carolina Department of Correction, its secretary, and a warden, sought an injunction prohibiting defendant North Caroline Medial Board from disciplining physicians for participating in an execution and a declaratory judgment delineating the parties' rights with regards to executions. The Medical Board challenged the ruling of the Superior Court, Wake County (North Carolina) that executions were  not medical procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The medical board issued a position statement, which prohibited physicians from participating in executions. Therefore, physicians declined to participate in executions in any manner, which resulted in a de facto moratorium on executions in North Carolina. The supreme court held that plaintiffs had standing to litigate the issue because they could not carry out their statutory duty to execute condemned inmates under the Execution Protocol without subjecting a physician to discipline by the Medical Board. There was a genuine controversy between plaintiffs and the Medical Board arising out of conflicting contentions as to their respective legal rights and liabilities under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-190 (2007). Section 15-190, by its plain language, envisioned physician participation in executions in some professional capacity. The Medical Board's position statement exceeded its authority under Chapter 90 because the statement directly contravened the specific requirement of physician presence found in &sect; 15-190. The language of the Protocol did not overstep the statutory authority of the Governor and Council of State to determine and approve the exact means of execution.</SPAN></P>

Among other things, the supreme court held that the exclusion of jurors who raised questions about their ability to follow the law on the death penalty was proper. A letter from defendant to his mother was properly admitted, as it constituted defendant's admission to the crime in his own words, was not needlessly cumulative, and was not unfairly prejudicial. Because defendant only raised a specific concern regarding the ability of codefendants to hear one another's testimony, it was not error to sequester only codefendants and not other witnesses. With regard to the penalty phase, the supreme court concluded, inter alia, that any error in submitting kidnapping charges to the jury was harmless in light of the robbery conviction also submitted, and because there was no reasonable possibility the sentencing recommendation would have differed since the jury also found the N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(5) and (9) aggravators. Finally, the court concluded that the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate, noting that defendant violated the victim's home and committed a brutal murder by strangulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 19 and 23, and federal due process rights were not violated; a failure to follow procedures in securing physical evidence was unintentional. The State's peremptory challenges to three African-American prospective jurors did not establish a pattern of discrimination. There was uncontroverted evidence from which the jury could infer that defendant formed the intent for first-degree murder. His admission that he fired three times in the victim's direction supported the premeditation and deliberation findings. The unanimity requirement was satisfied, even though alternate liability theories were submitted; defendant committed one of the N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17 felonies. Because the conviction was based on premeditation and deliberation and under the felony murder rule, neither a robbery with a dangerous weapon of the store owners or of a customer merged with the murder conviction. Any prosecutorial misstatement was cured by a jury instruction on its duty as to Issue Three of the Capital Sentencing form. Considering the crime and defendant, as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(d)(2), the case was similar to those in which the death sentence was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff child sued defendant health care providers for medical malpractice and recovery for injuries sustained at birth. The parties entered into confidential settlement agreements. The trial court determined that appellee, the North Carolina Division of Medical Assistance (DMA) had subrogation rights to the entire amount of the settlement. Appellant trustee appealed. The Court of Appeals of North Carolina affirmed. The trustee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into confidential settlement agreements and established a settlement account for the proceeds. Because the child was a North Carolina Medicaid recipient, the DMA sought to recover from the account the amount it paid for her medical expenses. The lower courts determined that the DMA had subrogation rights to the entire amount of the settlement, limited by the statutory provision of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 108A-57(a) (2005) that only one-third of a recovery was subject to subrogation. Because the amount expended by the DMA was less than one-third of the settlement, the courts ordered full reimbursement. The case thus presented the issue of whether the statutory framework governing the State of North Carolina's subrogation claim for medical expenses on a Medicaid recipient's tort claim settlement complied with federal Medicaid law under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396a(a)(25) (2000). The state supreme court found that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 108A-57(a) was a reasonable framework that comported with the requirements of federal Medicaid law. Therefore, the lower courts did not err in subrogating the child's settlement proceeds to the DMA, subject to the one-third statutory limitation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the traffic stop. Reasonable suspicion was the standard for traffic stops, regardless of whether a traffic violation was readily observed or merely suspected. To the extent language in State v. Ivey, 360 N.C. 562, 633 S.E.2d 459 (2006), might be interpreted as requiring probable cause, the supreme court specifically disavowed that interpretation. Defendant was stopped for violating N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-154(a) by failing to signal a lane change. The trial court found that at the time defendant's vehicle changed lanes without a signal, it was being operated by defendant immediately in front of the arresting officer's vehicle. That finding indicated that defendant's failure to signal violated &sect; 20-154(a) because it was clear that changing lanes immediately in front of another vehicle might affect the operation of the trailing vehicle. The officer's observation of the traffic violation gave him the required reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle. Thus, the trial court's findings of fact supported its conclusion of law that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by the stop.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's instructions on mitigating and aggravating factors were not improper, as the trial court submitted the mitigating factor of defendant's age to the jury and an instruction on pecuniary gain did not relieve the prosecution of its burden of proof. Finally, in denying defendant's motion to appropriate relief, the supreme court concluded that, inter alia, an allegedly perjured statement made by a witness for the State was in fact true and a jury instruction on accomplice testimony was not required.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 19 and 35. The North Carolina Court of Appeals (intermediate court) affirmed a summary judgment entered for the town. The sex offender appealed as of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state's highest court noted that &sect; 130.03 prohibited registered sex offenders from knowingly entering any public park owned, operated, or maintained by the town. The sex offender's alleged liberty interest to enter a park to have barbecues and enjoy nature along the riverbank was not protected by the right to intrastate travel as it was not a right of function upon which one would depend to carry out one's daily life activities. The sex offender's asserted liberty interest to freely roam in such parks was not a fundamental right as it was not so deeply rooted in the Nation's history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty that neither liberty nor justice would exist if it were sacrificed. The town had been delegated the authority to prohibit acts detrimental to its citizens' health, safety, or welfare by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-174 (2007). Protecting children and other visitors to parks owned and operated by the town from sexual attacks was a legitimate government interest. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.5 (2007) recognized that sex offenders posed a high risk of engaging in sex offenses. Section 130.03 was rationally related to a legitimate government interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, after his motion to suppress evidence was denied, was convicted by a jury in the trial court of two counts of possession of cocaine. Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of having achieved habitual felon status. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals of North Carolina found no error. Defendant appealed pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-30(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his constitutional rights were violated by the traffic stop that led to his convictions. In the traffic stop, a police officer, who was on patrol in a high crime area of a town where a number of bars were located, stopped his marked police car behind defendant's vehicle at a red traffic light. When the light turned green, defendant remained stopped for approximately 30 seconds before making a legal left turn. The officer then initiated the stop of the vehicle. The state supreme court reviewed defendant's challenge to the stop of his vehicle pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. IV and N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court found that, because defendant's 30-second delay at a green traffic light under the circumstances gave rise to a reasonable, articulable suspicion that he may have been driving while impaired, the stop of defendant's vehicle was constitutional and the evidence obtained as a result of the stop was properly admitted. It was irrelevant that part of the officer's motivation for stopping defendant may have been a perceived, though apparently nonexistent, statutory violation of impeding traffic.</SPAN></P>

Defendant raised various issues in his appeal, but the court found no reversible error.

The court found that the jury verdict form was not improper or misleading and there was no indication that the jury was confused. The admission of detention center incident reports during the penalty phase of the trial did not violate defendant's Confrontation Clause rights since the statements therein were not testimonial and were admissible under N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A custodial interrogation took place when defendant was 16 years old. Defendant argued that his juvenile rights were violated during the interrogation because the detectives did not cease questioning him when he requested to phone his aunt.

In order to prevent manifest injustice, the appellate court decided to review the issue despite the fact that defendant failed to properly preserve the issue for review. An &quot;aunt&quot; was not an enumerated relation in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7B-2101, and an interpretation of the term &quot;guardian&quot; to encompass anything other than a relationship established by legal process would have unjustifiably expanded the plain and unambiguous meaning of the word.

Stat. &sect; 7A-27(a), appealed the judgment imposing a sentence of death upon him by the Superior Court, New Hanover County (North Carolina), following a jury verdict finding defendant guilty of first degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence arose from the stabbing death of his neighbor with a paring knife. Defendant stole the victim's bank card and withdrew money from her account. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court committed error with regard to denying his challenge for cause with regard to a juror who was a chief of detectives for a police department. The court found no error, concluding that the trial court record supported the trial court's conclusion that the juror performed his duties consistent with the trial court's instructions as to considering mitigating evidence and, further, the juror never indicated that he would automatically give more weight to any particular testimony. Likewise, the trial court did not err by refusing defendant's challenge for cause regarding a juror who defendant asserted would vote automatically for the death penalty since the trial court made extensive inquiry into the issue. In applying a plain error analysis to certain other asserted errors, the court found no reason to disturb the conviction or sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that defendant received a fair trial and sentencing proceeding and found no error in his convictions or his sentences. The court also concluded that defendant's sentence of death was not disproportionate to the crime he committed and, therefore, affirmed defendant's conviction and death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county commissioners brought an action against defendant state officials in which plaintiffs argued that a redistricting plan violated the Whole County Provision (WCP), N.C. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 3(3), 5(3). A three-judge panel of the Superior Court, Wake County (North Carolina), issued a summary judgment order holding that the plan was required by &sect; 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">According to the United States Supreme Court, a minority group had to be sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district before a legislature was required to draw a legislative district under &sect; 1973. The court held that the proper statistic for deciding whether a minority group met the precondition was voting age population as refined by citizenship. Furthermore, a bright line rule was appropriate: thus, if a minority group lacked a numerical majority of citizens of voting age, the precondition had not been satisfied and it was not necessary to create a &sect; 1973 legislative district. The district in question here did not meet this bright line test. Thus, because the district was not required by &sect; 1973, it had to be drawn in accordance with the WCP and the requirements set forth by the court in Stephenson I. The district here did not comply with these criteria. One of the counties in question lacked sufficient population to support a non-VRA house district; thus, a voting district which included that county had to add population across a county line, but only to the extent necessary to comply with the one-person, one vote standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for armed robbery and first-degree murder. Defendant's conviction for first-degree murder was based on a theory of malice, premeditation, and deliberation, and the felony murder rule. Following a capital sentencing proceeding, a jury recommended a sentence of death. The Superior Court, Randolph County (North Carolina) entered judgment accordingly and arrested judgment on the robbery conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to exclude evidence related to a prior killing. The supreme court concluded that the evidence satisfied both the similarity and temporal requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 404(b), as, inter alia, both crimes involved a fatal stab wound to an unarmed victim's neck with a folding pocketknife, which occurred during an argument in the victim's home. While the supreme court found it was error to admit the detective's testimony regarding the prior crime since defendant did not testify, the supreme court further found the error harmless in light of the myriad of evidence that defendant committed the prior crime. Any error that occurred when a bailiff told jurors not to discuss the case or read any media accounts was harmless as, inter alia, the communication did not related to defendant's guilt or innocence. The trial court's refusal to submit certain mitigating circumstances to the jury was not erroneous, as there was no evidence defendant suffered from any mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the crime. Finally, the supreme court concluded that the death penalty was proportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile sought review of a decision of a divided panel of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina) which found no error in juvenile adjudication and disposition orders entered by the trial court. The issue was whether appellant could be adjudicated delinquent based upon violating the crime against nature statute. Appellant argued he could not be adjudicated delinquent because he was not more than three years older than his girlfriend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who was 14, was dating a girl who was 12. During the relationship, the two juveniles had sexual intercourse and engaged in two separate incidents of fellatio. The Supreme Court of North Carolina noted that the statutes that contained age differentials did not constrain appellant's sexual activity in the present instance. However, the crime against nature statute,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-177, did. Accordingly, appellant's actions violated the crime against nature statute, which did not contain any age differential element. Besides the goal of promoting proper notions of morality among the State's youth, the government's desire for a healthy young citizenry underscored the legitimacy of the government's interest in prohibiting the commission of crimes against nature by minors. Like vaginal intercourse, non-vaginal sexual activity carried with it the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, the crime against nature statute did not run afoul of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and narcotics, was involved in an auto accident with one fatality and personal injuries. The trial court found as an aggravating factor that defendant committed each felony while he was on pretrial release for another charge. Defendant contended that the trial court's failure to submit the aggravating factor in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.16(d)(12) (2005) to the jury was not harmless under U.S. Const. amend. VI. On appeal, the court found that the trial court possessed the authority to submit the aggravating factor to the jury using a special verdict in compliance with the aforementioned constitutional limitations. Thus, defendant's argument that the trial court lacked a procedural mechanism by which to submit the challenged aggravating factor to the jury was without merit. Moreover, the evidence presented at defendant's trial, showing that he committed the underlying crime while on pretrial release, was both uncontroverted and overwhelming. Finally, the trial court's finding of the aggravating factor at defendant's trial was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and did not violate N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 24.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the case for lack of standing. The appellate court disagreed. The claim of illegal and unconstitutional diversion of funds derived from taxes paid by the taxpayers and others similarly situated was an actual controversy. A declaratory judgment would have served to clarify and settle the legal rights and responsibilities of the governor and the State, as well as the legal status of the taxpayer funds in the Highway Trust Fund. A declaratory judgment also would have terminated the uncertainty and controversy giving rise to the action. Accordingly, the taxpayers had standing to seek equitable relief and a declaratory judgment. Declaratory judgment remained an appropriate remedy here. A declaration as to the legality and constitutionality of the governor's and the State's diversions from the Trust Fund may well have been the most assured and effective remedy available.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped after making a right turn without using a signal. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the traffic stop leading to defendant's arrest, alleging that the officer lacked probable cause to believe defendant's operation of the vehicle violated any traffic laws. The supreme court held that a reasonable officer, under the circumstances presented, would not have had probable cause to believe that a traffic violation occurred and, thus, the seizure and subsequent search of defendant's vehicle were unreasonable and violated defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment and N.C. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;20. The supreme court noted that the record did not indicate that any other vehicles or pedestrians were, or might have been affected by defendant's turn. Thus, the only question was whether the officer's vehicle might have been affected by the turn, which the supreme court concluded it was not. Defendant turned right, the only legal movement possible at the intersection and the officer's only option was to stop at the intersection, where there was a stop sign. Thus, the firearm recovered as a result of the search should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the Court of Appeals was reversed and the case was remanded with instructions to vacate defendant's convictions and remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the trial court of first-degree arson. The trial court weighed one aggravating factor against three mitigating factors and sentenced defendant to imprisonment for 51 to 71 months. The Court of Appeals of North Carolina remanded the case for resentencing, with instructions to submit any aggravating factor to the jury. The State of North Carolina appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court weighed one aggravating factor, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.16(d)(8) (2005), against three mitigating factors, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.16(e), and sentenced defendant to a sentence within the presumptive range. Defendant argued that his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated by the trial court not submitting the aggravating factor to the jury. The majority of the intermediate appellate court ruled that the sentence was unconstitutional because the judge, not the jury, found the aggravating factor. The state supreme court found that it could hear the appeal because N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-30(2) (2005) provided the State of North Carolina with an appeal of right as there was a dissent in the intermediate appellate court. Further, nothing in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1422 prohibited the state supreme court from addressing the issues presented in defendant's brief to the intermediate appellate court. As to whether defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated, the court found that the trial court inflicted punishment within the presumptive range, and consequently, its finding of an aggravating factor did not implicate the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers filed a purported class action against appellees, the State of North Carolina and the North Carolina Secretary of Revenue, for a judgment declaring that 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 424, &sect; 34.18(b) violated N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The trial court denied the taxpayers' motion for summary judgment and allowed the State's and the Secretary's motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeals of North Carolina affirmed. The taxpayers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers contended that 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 424, &sect; 34.18(b) was retrospective because it taxed income-producing acts previously done before the date of enactment. The state supreme court found that the imposition of a tax on income was a tax on an &quot;other act&quot; under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. However, 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 424, as codified in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-134.2(a) (2005), did not tax the taxpayers retrospectively. The subject of the enacted tax was the North Carolina taxable income of an individual taxpayer, which was computed on the basis of the taxable year under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-134.4 (2005). Regardless of whether the taxable year was determined by a taxpayer's annual accounting period or by the calendar year, the taxable income and corresponding tax liability or overpayment were not fixed until the close of that year. Thus, because the taxpayers' taxable income was not fixed at the date of enactment, the midyear tax rate increase implemented by 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws 424 was not levied until the conclusion of the taxable year. Consequently, the tax operated prospectively from the date of enactment and did not violate N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>

He appealed his convictions and his three death sentences, claiming in part that the trial court violated his right of confrontation by admitting certain documentary evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State investigative reports were admitted even though the person who made the reports did not testify; they described DNA test results, and his supervisor testified. The court ruled in part that the reports were properly admitted as business records under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 803(6) (2005), as they were not testimonial but were neutral and were not prepared for trial. Further, they were admissible under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 803(8), as public records; they concerned routine matters and recorded only ministerial observations. His statements to the police were admissible and did not violate his rights because his response as to whether he wanted to be questioned was ambiguous. There was no error in failing to submit to the jury his background as a mitigating factor under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(f)(1); his record before the murders showed many prior convictions. Thus, while it was error to consider his history after the murders, the error was harmless. There was no prosecutorial error, even though the argument as to the couple's deaths was graphic; the prosecutor drew reasonable inferences from the facts. The death sentences were proportional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled defendant's assignments of error, but found no error in the guilt and innocence phase and no error in the capital sentencing proceeding.

Defendant filed a motion for appropriate relief from a judgment imposing a sentence of death, which was denied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained that a juror was more than 65 years old. The court on review ruled that under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-6.1 (2001), the juror was qualified and that excusing her was in a trial court's discretion. It was no error to refuse to allow defendant to question prospective jurors about their death penalty attitudes; the trial court had the discretion to deny the request, and he showed no prejudice. Further, a juror was not excluded because he or she had an opinion about the death penalty. The trial court also allowed him to ask the jurors if they would apply the law as given. There no error in restoring some peremptory challenges as the trial court did not add to them; an entire venire was dismissed after it was learned that they discussed how to be excused, and the challenges replaced those that were already used. There was no juror misconduct when two jurors prayed outside the jury room. Nothing showed pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1420(b) that they discussed the case when praying. Thus, defendant had no right to relief on his motion, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1420(c)(6). Giving the heinous or atrocious instruction was not error.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the prosecution violated his right to a fair trial by knowingly offering false statements of an eyewitness. The supreme court disagreed. The length of time it took the victim to die was not easily proved. Although the medical examiner testified that the victim would not have survived as long as the witness testified--seven to eight hours--that testimony was his medical opinion. It could not be said that the eyewitness's statement was knowingly false when elicited. In fact, during closing arguments, the prosecution admitted that the eyewitness's perception of time &quot;might not have been correct.&quot; Similarly, the testimony about the &quot;emptying&quot; of the victim's handgun, while unlikely to be accurate, could not be said to have been known as false by the State. The witness was a confessed drug addict and under the influence of drugs at the time of the murder. That, along with her prior convictions and other circumstances of her lifestyle revealed at defendant's trial, made her a witness with less-than-perfect credibility. The prosecution could have believed that the eyewitness was simply mistaken and did not hear as many shots as she thought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Superior Court, Randolph County (North Carolina) for first-degree murder both on the basis of malice, premeditation and deliberation and on the basis of felony murder, which resulted in the death penalty. Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to declare a mistrial after a prospective alternate juror brought a newspaper article about the trial into the jury room.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stated that he knew he was going to kill the victim the day before the murder. Defendant shot the victim three times with a shotgun. Defendant said that the victim had not provoked him and declined to give a reason for the shooting. The appellate court held the evidence supported the trial court's finding that none of the 12 jurors selected for the sitting panel were in the jury room by the time the article appeared there and that defendant had not shown the substantial and irreparable harm required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1061 for declaration of a mistrial. Moreover, none of the alternate jurors participated in the deliberations at defendant's trial. Thus, even if alternate jurors were exposed to the article, any resulting taint was immaterial and caused defendant no prejudice. No rational jury could find that defendant's criminal activity was insignificant.  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in deciding not to instruct pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(f)(1). The record demonstrated that his maturity was consistent with his chronological age. The trial court did not err in declining to submit the N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of common law robbery, possession of cocaine, and being an habitual felon. The trial court sentenced defendant to a prison term of 133 months to 169 months. Defendant appealed. The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's decision. Pursuant to N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the supreme court was whether a six-year delay in the preparation of a trial transcript for appellate review violated defendant's constitutional or statutory right to an appeal. The supreme court held that defendant's statutory and due process rights were not violated by the six-year delay in producing his trial transcript. The supreme court noted that defendant bore the burden of proceeding and of ensuring that the record on appeal and verbatim transcript were complete, properly settled, in correct form, and filed with the appropriate appellate court by the applicable deadlines. In addition, the supreme court noted that, contrary to defendant's assertion, the burden was on defendant to show that the delay resulted from intentional conduct by the State. The supreme court agreed with the court of appeals that the record was devoid of any indication as to why the delay took place. The record included, inter alia, evidence that defense counsel made approximately nine inquiries to the court reporter regarding the transcript during the first two years, but there was a noticeable gap of about three years during which no inquiries were made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury's finding that three aggravating circumstances existed beyond a reasonable doubt as to both murders was supported by the record and was not the result of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor. Defendant was previously convicted of a felony involving the use of violence to the person under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(3). The murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(9). The murders were part of a course of conduct in which defendant engaged and which included the commission by him of other crimes of violence against other persons under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(11). The trial court submitted the N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(f)(2), (f)(6) and 30 nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. No juror found either statutory mitigating circumstance as to either murder, but at least one juror found 11 nonstatutory mitigating circumstances as to each murder. The highest court did not disturb the jury's weighing of the mitigating and aggravating circumstances under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(c) and found the death sentences proportionate, emphasizing the heinous, atrocious, or cruel mitigator and the double murder.</SPAN></P>

A forensic psychiatrist was properly allowed to give his opinion as to defendant's state of mind based on the fact that the victim was found lying prone on the floor.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was granted discretionary review of additional issues after the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), vacated a superior court judgment that convicted defendant on charges of assault by pointing a gun, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, and attempted murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the appellate court, defendant argued that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-144 (2003), which authorized the use of a short-form murder indictment, did not support defendant's conviction for attempted murder. While the appellate court disagreed, it vacated the attempted murder conviction based on reasoning that the indictment charged the offense of attempted common law murder, which was not recognized by North Carolina's general statutes. The court reversed, rejecting in the first instance the finding that the indictment charged attempted common law murder. The indictment could only have been for attempted first-degree murder because it recited defendant's specific intent to commit murder. Construing &sect; 15-144 in conjunction with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-170 (2003), the court then ruled that use of the short-form indictment for attempted first-degree murder was appropriate. Section 15-170 permitted an indictment for first-degree murder to sustain a conviction for attempted first-degree murder, and thus, the State was implicitly authorized to utilize the short-form indictment to actually charge attempted first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, various State of North Carolina agencies and officials, appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part, a trial court's order of summary judgment that addressed whether monetary payments to the state agencies were being retained in violation of N.C. Const. art. IX, &sect;&nbsp;7. Plaintiffs, various county school boards, had commenced the declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main issue was whether certain monetary payments to the state agencies were being remitted to the State's General Fund or being retained by those agencies in violation of art. IX, &sect; 7. The boards argued that the precedents held that any civil penalties paid for violation of a penal law of the State and accruing to the State were necessarily punitive and had to be paid to the public schools. Defendants argued that any penalty paid to the State to compensate it for an injury, damage, or loss above normal operating costs fell outside the scope of art. IX, &sect; 7. The court agreed with the boards that any monies collected by the Department of Revenue for late filings or underpayments and for failing to comply with various tax provisions fell within the scope of art. IX, &sect; 7 and were payable to the boards. The court also found that payments for traffic and parking funds collected by universities and payments made by environmental offenders were subject to art. IX, &sect; 7. The excise tax on unauthorized substances was not a penalty subject to the provisions of art. IX, &sect; 7 but penalties and interest monies for the collection of the same were. Other monies collected were also addressed.</SPAN></P>

The lower appellate court found no error in the conviction but remanded for resentencing only. Defendant's petition for discretionary review was granted. The court found, first, that while N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1422(f) normally barred such review, N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12, cl. 1, gave the court power to issue a decision since the lower appellate court's decision was of constitutional magnitude and widespread effect. The court affirmed the decision and agreed that those parts of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.16 violated the rule of Blakely since U.S. Const. amend. VI required that the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating factor be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt and not merely found by a judge by the preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision to resentence defendant, and the court modified the holding to clarify that the statute under which defendant's sentence was aggravated was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed petitions for a writ of supersedeas and for discretionary review with regard to the decision of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which reversed a judgment of a trial court that had convicted defendant of failing to register as a sex offender pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-208.11 (2003). Defendant was also found to have been a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a convicted sex offender from the State of South Carolina and was registered in that state. Defendant did not dispute that he moved to North Carolina wherein he lived with a girlfriend. Defendant was arrested in North Carolina for failing to register as a convicted sex offender in North Carolina. He was convicted and was also found to have attained the status of a habitual felon. Defendant sought to have &sect; 14-208.11 declared unconstitutional based on allegedly insufficient notice of the existence of the criminal statute itself. The lower court had found that North Carolina's sex offender registration statute was unconstitutional as applied to an out-of-state offender who lacked notice of his duty to register upon moving to North Carolina. The court disagreed and held that &sect; 14-208.11 was facially constitutional as applied to a convicted sex offender from another jurisdiction who subsequently moved to North Carolina, such as defendant. The court found that defendant had actual notice of his lifelong duty to register with South Carolina, which led a reasonable individual to inquire of a duty to register in any state upon relocation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that (1) there was no error in the selection of the jurors pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1214(h) (2003); (2) the trial court properly applied N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder, robbery with a firearm, and burning of a building used in trade. The jury recommended a death sentence for the murder conviction. The Superior Court, Guilford County (North Carolina) sentenced defendant to death for the murder conviction, a term of 103 to 133 months for the robbery and 21 to 26 months for the burning conviction. Defendant appealed his death sentence to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that defendant received a fair trial and capital sentencing proceeding, free of reversible error. Among other things, the supreme court found that the testimony of a social worker that the victim's family did not respond to her inquiries with respect to defendant's remorse was not an inadmissible victim impact statement. In addition, there was no error in the submission of aggravating and mitigating circumstances to the jury. The failure to instruct on the mitigating circumstance of lack of a significant history of prior criminal activity was properly based on evidence of defendant's prior robbery convictions, as no rational jury could have concluded that defendant had no significant history of prior criminal activity. Nor did the supreme court find that defense counsel improperly conceded to jurors during voir dire that defendant was guilty, thus depriving defendant of his right to effective assistance of counsel. In addition, with regard to statements made during trial, the record reflected that defendant consented to the trial strategy employed by his defense counsel. Finally, the supreme court found no merit in defendant's proportionality challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a continuance as to a pretrial hearing where the record established that substitute second chair counsel was adequately prepared to proceed; counsel filed numerous motions on defendant's behalf, met several times with the prosecutors, and engaged in aggressive and informed cross-examination. The supreme court further found no error in the trial court's refusal to excuse two prospective jurors for cause where both indicated that they could set aside their personal opinions about the death penalty and reach a decision based on the law. Next, in addressing issues relating to the trial, the supreme court found that the time it took a witness to drive a half a mile did not require subsequent statements to be excluded as they were made sufficiently close to the event as to be admissible as present sense impressions. In addition, evidence of two prior assaults was properly admitted under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 403, 404(b), as such evidence demonstrated that defendant was aware that striking a person with a beer bottle was a reckless and dangerous act that could cause serious injury.</SPAN></P>

The jury found five aggravators: prior violent felony (robbery), avoiding arrest, first-degree kidnapping, pecuniary gain, and especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(3), (4), (5), (6), (9), and recommended the death penalty, which the trial court imposed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal bypassed the appeals court. Defendant, co-defendant, and the State's eyewitness, who pleaded guilty for a reduced sentence in exchange for his testimony, kidnapped an 89-year-old woman victim from her home, repeatedly beat her and placed in her car's trunk, where she was fighting to free herself, trapped for hours, helpless, in fear, and died when defendant set the car on fire, with her in it, from carbon monoxide poisoning. The jury found two statutory mitigators and six nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. The State had race-neutral reasons for exercising peremptory challenges. Defendant's and co-defendant's cases were properly joined, considering the same facts were involved. The State's analogies, references to jurors by name, and other closing arguments were not improper. There was sufficient evidence to submit kidnapping to the jury. The pecuniary gain aggravator was supported by taking a purse; the &quot;in course of a kidnapping&quot; aggravator by taking a car. There was no double counting. Since defendant's prior crimes could be construed as not violent, they had to be submitted as mitigators, although he argued they enforced the prior crime aggravator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The highest court affirmed the convictions, and, after conducting its independent proportionality review, concluded the case was more similar to cases in which it had found the sentence of death proportionate than disproportionate, and affirmed the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court imposed death sentences and prison terms to each defendant. Defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and a co-defendant were gang members. Three of the gang members, in carrying out an assignment, abducted a woman, put her in the trunk of her car, robbed her, and returned in the car to their leader's home. Defendant and other members then drove the woman to a remote area where one gang member shot her. However, the woman feigned death and survived her wounds. Because there was not enough room in the woman's car for all the gang members, defendant and other gang members then followed and stopped two women in their car. The women were placed in the trunk of the car, robbed, and driven to the leader's home. The gang members then drove the two cars to a secluded area where defendant shot and killed one woman and the co-defendant shot and killed the other woman. On appeal, the court found that (1) there was no error in the joint trial; (2) there was no error in the selection of jurors; and (3) there was no prejudicial error in the instructions. However, the trial court erred in denying the co-defendant's motion for mistrial because the jury poll was not timely and because intervening evidence the jury heard led to substantial and irreparable prejudice to the co-defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed; defendant's death sentence was affirmed; and the co-defendant's death sentence was vacated with a remand for a new capital sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Denial of suppression as to defendant's inculpatory statement was proper because defendant was not in custody, and errors in jury selection were not grounds for reversal. There was sufficient evidence of attempted rape to present to the jury, and admission of his statement to a holding cell officer was proper, as it was relevant. There was evidence of defendant's remorse, such that exclusion of other remorse evidence was harmless, and prosecutors' closing arguments were reasonable inferences based on the evidence. There was sufficient evidence to support the aggravating circumstance, and pursuant to the proportionality review, the sentence was not deemed excessive or disproportionate to others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's many claims on appeal related to jury selection, the guilt-innocence phase, the sentencing proceeding, preservation issues, and proportionality. The supreme court found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing two prospective jurors for cause, as both prospective jurors clearly demonstrated their inability to render a verdict in accordance with the state's laws. Defendant had shown no prejudice flowing from the fact that the State proceeded on two theories with regard to felony murder, namely &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; in connection with premeditation and deliberation, and &quot;acting in concert.&quot; The State properly used victim impact testimony to describe the specific harm caused by defendant's actions. Defendant demonstrated no compelling reason to depart from the supreme court's prior holdings in regard to preservation issues. After a review of the transcript, record on appeal, briefs, and oral arguments of counsel, the jury's finding of three distinct aggravating circumstances submitted was supported by the evidence, and nothing suggested that defendant's death sentences were imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

The action arose out of challenges to redistricting for House and Senate legislative elections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the first action, plaintiffs-A alleged that 2001 redistricting plans for the North Carolina House and Senate were flawed. The plan was found violative of N.C. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 3, 5, and a permanent injunction was issued against future legislative elections. 2002 redistricting plans were also unconstitutional, but interim plans were upheld on appeal. Thereafter, a new redistricting plan for 2003 was enacted, and plaintiffs-B sought a determination as to the constitutionality thereof. Plaintiffs-A alleged that the 2003 plans were unconstitutional. Parts of the 2003 plan were found unconstitutional, with the remaining parts of the plan upheld. The court found that as action-A was complete, a challenge to the 2003 plans therein was error. The trial court properly denied a motion to dismiss by defendants-B, as plaintiffs-B had standing and a declaratory judgment action was proper. The three-judge panel of superior court judges required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-267.1 was proper, the venue provisions and assignment of judges under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-81.1 and 1-267.1 were constitutional, and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 120-2.3 and -2.4 were not unconstitutional limits on the judicial branch.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On writ of certiorari, the State appealed from an order entered by the Superior Court, Durham County (North Carolina), declaring N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-455.1 (Supp. 2002) unconstitutional and enjoining the court clerk from collecting the appointment fee and entering civil judgments pursuant to &sect; 7A-455.1(b). The SUPREME COURT OF NORTH CAROLINA had issued a writ of supersedeas staying enforcement of the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appointment fee was assessed against indigent defendants who received appointed counsel regardless of the outcome of the criminal proceedings. The State's highest court held that the portion of the appointment fee that was allocated to the North Carolina Indigent Persons' Attorney Fee Fund was a cost of prosecution. The portion allocated to the North Carolina Court Information Technology Fund was a facilities fee. Under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, the appointment fee could not be imposed until defendant was convicted or pled guilty or nolo contendere. However, 2002 N.C. Sess. Laws 126, which enacted N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 7A, had a severability clause. Thus, the requirement that payment be made regardless of the outcome could be severed to allow the State to assess the fee against convicted defendants. The portion of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-455.1(a) (Supp. 2002) requiring payment &quot;at the time of appointment&quot; was also severed, as was &sect; 7A-455.1(b). The remaining provisions of &sect; 7A-455.1 could be enforced independently. As modified, &sect; 7A-455.1 did not have an unconstitutional chilling effect on a defendant's constitutional rights to counsel and notice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not stop at the checkpoint, but drove through it, nearly striking the officer. The officer pursued defendant, who finally stopped more than a mile beyond the checkpoint. Defendant argued that the checkpoint was unconstitutionally authorized. The intermediate appellate court ruled that the trial court erred by analyzing the stop and arrest in terms of the legality of the checkpoint. The appellate court held that the relevant issue was whether the officer had reasonable articulable suspicion to stop defendant after he drove through the checkpoint. The officer had reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant committed several crimes. The checkpoint stop was a minimal intrusion. The officer's standing permission to set up checkpoints pursuant oral guidelines and the officer's call to his supervisor before setting up the checkpoint were constitutionally sufficient restraints. The need for written guidelines or supervisory permission were not lynchpins for the constitutionality of a checkpoint.

On appeal, the court found that (1) the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable juror to find attempted sale of cocaine by defendant, a lesser-included offense of sale of cocaine, so the trial court's submission to the jury of sale of cocaine as a predicate felony to support defendant's felony murder conviction for one victim's death was not error; (2) the trial court did not err by trying defendant under the short form bills of indictment issued in the case; (3) the murder of the other victim was properly used to support submission of the N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(11) (2001) aggravating circumstance to the jury; (4) the trial court's submission of the N.C. Gen.

These findings of fact adequately supported the trial court's conclusion that the new redistricting plans failed to attain strict compliance with the legal requirements previously set forth by the supreme court and were unconstitutional. The new plan involved excessive division of counties, contrary to N.C. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 3(3) and 5(3), deficiencies in county groupings, and substantial failures in compactness, contiguity, and communities of interest. The revised senate plan cut across interior county boundaries more than necessary, clustered portions of counties to structure individual county groups, and violated the requirement that districts be compact. The revised house plan cut county lines more than necessary to comply with the federal &quot;one-person, one-vote&quot; requirement and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1971, and violated the mandate that districts be compact.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court concluded that the Fifth Amendment did not apply to state prosecutions. The supreme court noted that only possible constitutional implication that Ring and Apprendi could have had in relation to North Carolina capital defendants was that they must have received reasonable notice of aggravating circumstances, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment's notice requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Cleveland County, N.C., Department of Social Services (agency), received an anonymous call of an unsupervised two-year-old child, naked in the driveway of a house. Respondent parents refused to allow a caseworker to privately interview the child or his siblings. The trial court ordered the parents not to interfere with the investigation, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals (North Carolina). The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the hearing before the trial court, the father attempted to explain what happened. Objections were sustained, and the trial court instructed the father to confine his testimony to the events that transpired at the time the caseworker arrived at his home. All further evidence related solely to the effort of the caseworker to interview the children in private, and the parents' refusal to allow her to do so. The highest appellate court found that it was never determined whether there was sufficient evidence of neglect to trigger the investigative requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7B-302. An anonymous call, reporting a naked child, two years of age, unsupervised in a driveway, did not, standing alone, constitute a report of abuse, neglect, or dependency. There was no evidence of a pattern of a lack of supervision or other credible evidence that indicated a serious failing by the parents. Therefore, the investigative mandate of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7B-302 was not properly invoked. It followed that the trial court's order, based upon the petition filed pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7B-303, charging the parents with interference with or obstruction of an investigation, would have to fail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the lower appellate court was reversed, and the case was remanded to the lower appellate court for further remand to the trial court, for the entry of an order consistent with the instant opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sued appellee employer in the Superior Court, Orange County (North Carolina), for age and sex discrimination and retaliatory firing. The employer counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-492 (2001) and Orange County, N.C., Civil Rights Ordinance art. II, &sect; 2.1(a) (1995) violated N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24(1)(j). The trial court granted summary judgment to the employer. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee alleged that she was forced to resign from her employer because of her age and sex, and also that the employer retaliated against her for filing her discrimination claim. The employer counterclaimed that the employment provisions of the county ordinance, Orange County, N.C., Civil Rights Ordinance art. II, &sect; 2.1(a), under which the employee brought suit and the enabling act for that ordinance, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-492, were unconstitutional as they violated N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24(1)(j). The supreme court found that the employer's counterclaim was brought well within any limitations period. Further, there was no unreasonable delay in bringing the challenge so that the counterclaim was not barred by laches. Finally, neither the enabling legislation nor the employment provisions of the ordinance suggested any rational basis for justifying the treatment of Orange County differently from all other North Carolina counties as to employment rights. By seeking to curb unlawful discrimination by regulating covered employers, the enabling legislation and the ordinance had the practical effect of regulating labor, which was forbidden by N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24(1)(j).</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant turned himself in and admitted he shot another man to death. The evidence indicated defendant and the victim had a conflict over a woman. Defendant filed a handwritten, pro se speedy trial motion one year later. Nearly 21 months later, defendant's court-appointed attorneys filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. At a hearing, the State stipulated to statements made by two potential witnesses. One witness was in prison. The other witness, the woman, could not be located, but the State informed the court it was trying to find her. The State also presented defendant with a list of the large number of murder cases tried between his indictment and the hearing. The motion was denied. Defendant pled guilty to second-degree murder right before trial and shortly after the woman had been located. After the appellate court affirmed the denial of the motion, the state supreme court found that application of the four-factor Barker test showed that defendant's right to a speedy trial had not been violated despite a four-year delay between his indictment and plea bargain, especially since the court's crowded docket and not the State's inaction contributed to the delay.</SPAN></P>

During the trial, photographs of the two murdered victims were admitted into evidence. Later, during closing arguments, one of the prosecutors allegedly compared defendant to Adolph Hitler. The state supreme court held, inter alia, that pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 403, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting one photograph to identify a particular victim and to illustrate what a police officer observed. A second photograph was properly admitted to show the relative location of the victims. The closing argument consisted of a rambling, disjointed personal attack on defendant, filled with irrelevant historical references and name-calling. Although the argument was improper, given the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, she was not prejudiced thereby.</SPAN></P>

The state property tax commission confirmed the valuation assigned by the county. The Court of Appeals (North Carolina) reversed. The county appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer built a low income housing project pursuant to 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 42 (2000), which provided income tax credits for such construction. The county valued the property using the cost approach. The taxpayer wanted the property to be valued by the income approach, taking into account the market impact of 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 42 (2000) use and rent restrictions. The appellate court ruled that a taxpayer challenging an ad valorem tax assessment needed to show that the means used by the tax supervisor were illegal or arbitrary and also that the valuation was unreasonably high. The taxpayer failed to show that the assessed value of the property exceeded its fair market value. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-317 allowed the cost approach. Where the income approach was used, the valuation was to be based on market rents, not contractually restricted rents. Because 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 42 (2000) restrictions were freely entered contractual covenants, not governmental regulations, a taxpayer was not allowed to artificially alter the value of its property below fair market value. Since the evidence was known before the hearing, the tax commission considered the incorrect square footage of the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. The case was remanded to the property tax commission for the limited purpose of substituting in its final decision the correct square footage of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a wife, moved for a domestic violence protection order (DVPO) against defendant, her husband. The trial court dismissed the complaint and denied the husband's request for a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of the North Carolina Domestic Violence Act (DVA), N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 50B (2001). The husband appealed, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed and remanded in part. The wife appealed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that an actual controversy existed between the parties for purposes of the North Carolina Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act (NCUDJA), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-253 to 1-267 (2001), and that the husband was entitled to a ruling on the constitutionality of the DVA. The state supreme court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-257 permitted a trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, to decline a request for declaratory relief when (1) the requested declaration would serve no useful purpose in clarifying or settling the legal relations at issue, or (2) the requested declaration would not terminate or afford relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, or controversy giving rise to the proceeding. The state supreme court held that in the instant case, the trial court properly declined the husband's request for declaratory relief. Because the husband was not subject to the provisions of the DVA at the time the trial court addressed his counterclaim and because he made no showing that he was threatened with further litigation under the DVA, a declaration as to the constitutionality of the DVA could not have altered the husband's legal position.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted possession of cocaine, felonious possession of drug paraphernalia, and being a habitual felon.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sentenced defendant to serve 101 to 131 months' confinement for attempted possession of cocaine. Defendant filed a motion for appropriate relief asserting that his record level had been improperly calculated as a Level VI when in fact his criminal history resulted in a Level V for sentencing purposes. The trial court vacated and set aside the guilty plea and the judgment. Defendant argued that the felony drug paraphernalia indictment after his successful motion for appropriate relief was in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1335 (2001) and that the subsequent sentence for attempted possession of cocaine also violated &sect; 15A-1335. The supreme court held that the indictment for felonious possession of drug paraphernalia was invalid, as the charge was not supported by any statute. Thus, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to hear defendant's appeal. After defendant's plea and sentence were set aside pursuant to his motion for appropriate relief, a sentence of 135 to 175 months' imprisonment for attempted possession of cocaine was contrary to &sect; 15A-1335 when defendant's original sentence was only 101 to 131 months' imprisonment for the same offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for felonious possession of drug paraphernalia was vacated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attacked his live-in girlfriend with a machete, carried her to the bedroom, and then killed her by strangulation. The court found that use of the assault as an underlying felony for the felony murder conviction was appropriate because the assault was a separate offense from the murder and did not merge into the homicide. Further, testimony about the victim's statements the day before the murder, to the effect that she was tired of defendant taking her money to buy drugs, and that she had asked him to leave, indicated difficulties in the relationship prior to the murder. Thus, the statements were admissible to show the victim's state of mind, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 803(3). The court also found that a summary paragraph from a certified foreign judgment was properly admitted to support an aggravating circumstance under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(3). A court clerk testified that the documents were signed and certified in a manner verifying their authenticity, and a fingerprint expert testified without objection that the fingerprints from the foreign jurisdiction were those of defendant.

The jury recommended a sentence of death. The trial court entered judgment imposing a death sentence for the murder conviction while arresting judgment on the armed robbery conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police detective asked defendant to go to a police station for questioning about the murder of defendant's co-worker. Defendant was told that he was not under arrest and was free to leave. The detective asked for and received defendant's shoes because he thought he saw blood on the shoes. Days later, the detective again asked to speak with defendant about the murder at the station. Defendant again was told that he was not under arrest and was free to leave. Defendant gave a confession, left the station, and was arrested hours later. Defendant argued that his statements and the blood on his shoes, which belonged to the victim, were inadmissible because he was not read his Miranda rights before the questionings. On appeal, the supreme court found that the police were not required to give defendant Miranda warnings, as defendant was not in custody when he made the statements, and the statements were given voluntarily. Further, the blood on his shoes was admissible, as consent to search was given. However, the trial court's conclusion that defendant failed to present a prima facie showing to challenge the prosecutor's peremptory strikes of prospective minority jurors was in error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Stanly County (North Carolina), in a second jury trial, convicted defendant of first-degree murder (on theories of malice, premeditation, and deliberation, and the felony murder rule) and two counts of second-degree kidnapping (of the victim, who was his girlfriend but who was reuniting with her husband, and her son) and imposed the death sentence. Defendant appealed as of right pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-27(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered the victim's home, took her and her son to the bedroom, made them get on their knees, hit and kicked her, pointed the gun at the son's head and said if she did not shut up, he would shoot the son, brought her out of the house, with her hands bound behind her back, forced her into a car and back out of the car, struck her three to four times and slammed her head into the car, and shot her more than once when she tried to run away. The high court, in affirming, found the trial court did not abuse its discretion by changing venue to Stanly County; defendant had requested a change and the State had consented, and the trial court had inherent power to change venue in the interests of justice notwithstanding the apparent statutory limitation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-957 (2001). Defendant did not have a right to replace his counsel because he was dissatisfied with their tactics. Prosecutorial comments were reviewed and were not misconduct. A statement that the victim and her husband were reuniting was admitted under a hearsay exception. The supreme court exhaustively reviewed diminished capacity, insanity, aggravators, and statutory and nonstatutory mitigators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that defendant received a fair trial and capital sentencing proceeding, free from prejudicial error, that, after its proportionality review, the sentence of death was neither disproportionate nor excessive based upon the characteristics of defendant and the crimes committed, and affirmed the judgments and sentences, including the death sentence for first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two first-degree murders on the basis of premeditation and deliberation and under the felony murder rule, and of conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon. On the jury's recommendation, the Superior Court, Mecklenburg County (North Carolina), sentenced him to death for each murder conviction. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the same day, defendant fatally shot two men in two separate robberies. He confessed to both murders. He claimed error in a witness's reference to his prior experience with Miranda warnings. The supreme court held that, as he acknowledged shooting both victims, any error was harmless. The amended version of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(3) was unambiguous, and allowed consideration of his juvenile adjudication for what would have been felony armed robbery had he been an adult. A jury charge did not allow jurors to consider his juvenile crime as evidence to support the &quot;course of conduct&quot; aggravating circumstance. Use of the juvenile conviction did not implicate the ex post facto prohibition. His claims of error on six issues to permit the supreme court to reexamine its prior holdings and preserve them for review were rejected. The record supported the aggravating circumstances the jury found, and the death sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors. Finally, in light of the three statutory aggravators the jury found, and the egregious disregard for human life defendant showed, the death sentence was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The COURT OF APPEALS OF NORTH CAROLINA held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the suit and should have dismissed the action.

The individual spent $ 500,000 in capital improvements to his land to further the pigeon shoots and further claimed that the pigeon shoots provided approximately 50 percent of his net income. A district attorney notified the individual that the pigeon shoot violated N.C. Gen.

The appellate court held that the individual's action should have been dismissed, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). On appeal, the supreme court found that the case presented an actual controversy between parties with adverse interests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hit the victim with a bottle. Another man and teenage girl then tied up the victim. They placed the victim in the trunk of his car and drove him to a secluded area. When the victim was released from the trunk, he attempted to flee, but defendant and the other man shot and killed him. On appeal, the supreme court found that: (1) defendant did not hold a subjective expectation of privacy in an unsealed envelope he delivered to a prison deputy, and if he did, this expectation was not objectively reasonable; (2) the trial court did not err in excusing a juror for cause, because of the juror's death penalty views; (3) the trial court did not err by limiting defendant's questioning of prospective jurors; (4) defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel by counsel's admissions; (5) the State did not improperly vouch for witnesses; (6) there was no error in using defendant's juvenile adjudication as an aggravating circumstance; (7) defendant could prove no prejudice from an unrecorded charge conference; (8) the trial court did not err in failing to interrupt the State's closing argument; and (9) the sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant kidnapped, robbed, raped and murdered two victims. The supreme court held his whispered request for counsel, not overheard by police, and stating his father wanted him to have counsel, did not invoke his right to counsel. Counsel's request to see defendant was also insufficient. A common modus operandi and temporal proximity allowed the murders' trial joinder. Evidence of defendant's premeditation and deliberation, countered only by his denial, did not allow a second-degree murder instruction. Defendant's kidnap and robbery victim could testify under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 404(b). Testimony about a rape kit used when the crimes occurred but since lost was proper as it was unlikely defendant could have tested it, and no willful intent to lose it was shown. A prosecution witness with speech problems was competent. A victim's fear of defendant's knife proved lack of consent. Arrest of judgment on the felonies underlying defendant's felony murder convictions was not required due to his conviction based on premeditation and deliberation. Defendant could not substitute retained counsel for appointed counsel during trial. His death sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in denying a challenge for cause of a prospective juror who had been rehabilitated following initial answers making her vulnerable to a cause challenge. There was no error in the denial of individualized jury selection. A photo array was not improperly suggestive. The burden of persuasion was on defendant in making a Batson motion, and the trial court did not err in denying that motion. Other jurors were properly excused on the basis of age. The prosecutor's closing argument pointing out defendant's failure to answer the State's evidence was not an improper comment on defendant's failure to testify. However, the cumulative effect of the improprieties in the prosecutor's cross-examination of defendant's expert and his closing argument unfairly prejudiced defendant in the penalty phase of the trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, voters and others (voters), brought suit against defendants, state election board officials and others (board), alleging legislative redistricting plans violated the North Carolina Constitution. After federal removal and remand, the Superior Court, Johnston County (North Carolina), granted summary judgment to the voters. The board appealed, and expedited direct review was granted. A stay prohibiting plan implementation was entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board, attempting to justify the redistricting plan, argued that the whole-county provisions (WCP) of N.C. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 3(3), 5(3) were no longer enforceable, because of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1973 et seq. In rejecting the board's argument, the highest court found that the VRA did not require a state to adopt any particular reapportionment plan, only that it not dilute the voting strength of legally protected minority groups. In interpreting the North Carolina Constitution, the intentions of the people, as stated therein, would be accorded the fullest effect possible. County boundary lines were not respected in the redistricting plan. The highest court concluded that the legislature improperly divided counties in creating legislative districts, beyond the extent necessary to comply with federal law. Since the redistricting plans were in violation of the WCP, they were unconstitutional. As for the appropriate remedy, strict scrutiny analysis was applied. The highest court set forth restrictions as to what would be permissible, in crossing county boundary lines, in the adoption of a new redistricting plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The orders of the trial court were affirmed, as modified.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered a cashier. The supreme court held he was not entitled to a venue change for pretrial publicity, individual voir dire, or a challenge for cause. His voir dire was not unduly limited, and he could not examine the jury about life sentence parole eligibility. He showed no basis for his objection to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence. A photograph of him wearing a shirt found near the crime scene was relevant. His attempt to have lay witnesses vouch for another witness's veracity was improper questioning, as was his question seeking a hearsay response. The evidence of his premeditation and deliberation, as well as of his overt act in furtherance of robbery, was sufficient. The trial court did not have to intervene ex mero motu in the prosecutor's argument nor instruct the jury on a mitigating circumstance subsumed in another mitigating instruction. Common law robbery was inherently violent, so the aggravating instruction that he committed a violent crime did not err. As the evidence supported both premeditated and felony murder, the underlying felony could be an aggravating circumstance under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(5). His sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000 proceeding jury recommendation, entered the death penalty for the murder and prison sentences for the non-capital crimes. Defendant appealed under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-27(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's direct appeal of right to the supreme court under &sect; 7A-27(a) in the capital case bypassed the appeals court. Defendant was laid off work, asked a co-worker to explain his unemployment benefits, took the co-worker to his home and beat her, took her and her credit cards and withdrew money or made unauthorized charges, put the co-worker in the trunk of his car, drove to a secluded area, shot her, discarded her body, and cleaned up blood in his apartment, all with his wife's help. The superior court arrested the conviction of kidnapping as part of the murder. The supreme court found sufficient evidence for the jury to find defendant guilty of all charges and to find N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(5), (6), and (9) aggravating factors (during a robbery, for pecuniary gain, and especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel). The prosecutor's remarks were not beyond the fair comment scope. The jury, upon conviction, did not decide Edmund-Tison culpability, so collateral estoppel did not prevent that jury instruction during the sentencing phase. The death penalty was not disproportionate based upon comparison with other supreme court death penalty cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed that part of the judgment (1) convicting defendant of the crimes, and (2) sentencing defendant to death for first-degree murder. The supreme court reversed that part of the judgment sentencing defendant to prison for the two non-capital crimes, since there was insufficient evidence of the violation of trust or confidence aggravator, and remanded for re-sentencing for only the two non-capital crimes.</SPAN></P>

Taking the dead victim's car was robbery as the death and the taking were a continuous transaction. The kidnapping was separate enough from the murder to allow conviction of a separate crime. Absence of evidence defendant lacked premeditation foreclosed a lesser included offense instruction on second degree murder, and defendant was not entitled to such instruction because the jury could believe only some of the State's evidence. Defense counsel did not concede defendant's guilt without his permission. The trial court adequately investigated alleged improper juror contact. The evidence allowed submission of more than one aggravating circumstance, and did not require submission of no prior criminal activity, mental disturbance, capacity to appreciate, and age mitigating circumstances.

He was sentenced to death for the murder and to imprisonment for the assault. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant married and had children. He and his wife separated and he was violent towards her. She told others she feared him. She got an ex parte domestic violence protective order. She told her parents no longer to let him see the children before school. The day before the order hearing, he forced his way past her father to visit the children and became emotional. Later he got his shotgun, returned to her parents' place and shot her, then reloaded and shot her again as she pleaded for her life. He sped away, but later had someone drove him to police, to whom he confessed, and who found medication in his pocket. The supreme court held that defendant failed to show actual conflict of interest as to public defenders initially assigned to him who later joined the district attorney. His requests to rehabilitate jurors initially equivocal on the death penalty but later resolutely against it were properly denied. The victim's expressions of fear were &quot;existing mental condition&quot; hearsay exceptions; her expressions of concern for her children, while dying, were &quot;excited utterances.&quot; An officer's testimony that he had probable cause for arrest was not a forbidden &quot;interpretation of law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's trial and capital sentencing proceeding were free from prejudicial error and his sentence of death was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

Defendant could not try to commit a juror to a legal position before being instructed, and his ability to inquire into jurors' religious beliefs was limited. The prosecutor's leading questions on voir dire were not error, nor was individual and sequestered voir dire required. The trial court did not err by precluding defendant from arguing, at resentencing, that another person committed the murder, as this would have improperly attempted to present residual doubt as a mitigating circumstance. The evidence did not warrant submission of the duress mitigating circumstance, under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(f)(5), nor the minor participation in a capital felony mitigator under &sect; 15A-2000(f)(4). Because a jury found defendant guilty of murder after premeditation, without being instructed on acting in concert, an instruction on defendant's intent was not required at resentencing. Defense counsel's concession in closing was trial strategy, rather than ineffective assistance. The prosecutor's argument was not an improper general deterrence argument. Defendant's sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee legislator filed a declaratory judgment action in the Superior Court of Wake County, North Carolina, against appellant state officials and judges challenging the constitutionality of an amendment to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-16 increasing the number of judges on the court of appeals. The trial court held a portion of the statute unconstitutional and severed that portion from the remainder of the statute. The officials and judges appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state general assembly passed an amendment to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-16 in 2000 which purported to increase the size of the state court of appeals from 12 to 15 judges. The statute provided that each of the new judgeships would be created at the time of appointment of an individual to the particular position and that each judge would thereafter hold office until facing an initial retention election in 2005. The legislator argued that the provision allowing the new judges to serve for that period of time conflicted with the provisions of N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 19, which required a judge appointed to a vacancy to stand for election at the next general election. The appellate court held that the statute did in fact conflict with the state constitution and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-9 and was therefore unconstitutional. Despite the legislature's attempt to make the judgeships effective on appointment, the judgeships were created by the statute, and vacancies in those judgeships had to be filled according to law. The remaining portions of the statute could however stand alone and the trial court had properly given effect to a severance clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner developer proposed a subdivision opposed by neighboring residents. The parties negotiated a conditional use zoning permit providing a buffer between the developments including a fence. Some land which made up the buffer was included in the lots sold to the homeowners. As a result, the fence divided their property. They installed gates in the fence to allow access to their property on the opposite side of the fence and were notified this violated the conditional use permit. The permit conveyed a clear desire for privacy through a wide buffer including a fence restricting residential access, which was to be undisturbed, and did not provide for gates. The landowners argued they were liable for torts and taxes in connection with land to which they had no access, but there was no reasonable basis for tort liability absent willful action and the lack of access potentially reduced their tax liabilities. This was not an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; of the homeowners' private property as no new conditions on the homeowners' use were imposed and the permit was not imposed by a legislative or regulatory body, but was requested and negotiated by the developer.</SPAN></P>

The jury recommended a sentence of death for the first-degree murder conviction, and the trial court entered judgment in accordance with that recommendation. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence was sufficient to permit a jury to find defendant killed the victim with premeditation and deliberation. In addition, the supreme court found that the kidnapping and felony murder convictions were supported by sufficient evidence. Also, a rational jury could have concluded defendant had no significant history of prior criminal activity. Accordingly, the trial court properly submitted the N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(f)(1) (1999) mitigating circumstance to the jury. However, the supreme court found no indication that the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. Therefore, after concluding its proportionality review, based upon the characteristics of defendant and the crimes she committed, the supreme court was convinced that the sentence of death recommended by the jury and ordered by the trial court was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee airport authority filed an action in the Superior Court, Guilford County (North Carolina), to condemn appellant landowner's property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the authority's proposal, an air cargo company would construct a building on the condemned land, to expand its already existing facility, and pay rent to the airport authority. This action involved a reasonable connection with the convenience and necessity of the airport authority, which was publicly created, because it would locate an air cargo facility next to existing airport runways and facilities. The activity also had to benefit the public generally, as opposed to special interests or persons. The public expressed its desire in N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 13, to develop airports and seaports. This provision did not conflict with the requirement of N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(1), that taxation be exercised for a public purpose. The two provisions acted in concert so that any activity pursuant to art. V, &sect; 13(1)(a), could be fully realized insofar as it was for a public purpose or public use. The public's desire to develop airports included the physical expansion of the air cargo company's facilities on the airport authority's property. Therefore, the envisioned use of the condemned property was constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following affirmance of the dismissal of its federal claims, plaintiff estate filed suit in the state court against defendants, patrolman and state highway patrol. The trial court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. The North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed, in part, allowing the estate's unconstitutional detention and equal protection claims to proceed. The patrolman and state highway patrol appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claim was premised on events that occurred when the patrolman stopped and killed the decedent. That was when the statutes of limitation began to run. On appeal, the patrolman and the state highway patrol argued that the statute of limitations had run on the estate's claims. The supreme court agreed and held that if the estate sought recovery for state constitutional violations, it should have named the patrolman in his official capacity. The estate failed to name the patrolman in his official capacity until almost five years after the cause of action accrued, and almost two years after the statute of limitations had expired. Thus, the claim for unreasonable detention against the patrolman was barred by the statute of limitations. As to the state highway patrol, the estate failed to name it as a party until the amended complaint more than five years after the decedent was stopped and killed and more than two years after the statute of limitations expired. The addition of the highway patrol in the amended state complaint did not relate back to the original state complaint because the relation back doctrine did not apply to parties, only to claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the court of appeals on the two issues presented, thereby reinstating the trial court's order dismissing all claims against the state patrolman and the state highway patrol. The supreme court also held that it improvidently allowed discretionary review on any additional issues not specifically addressed in this opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court, Halifax County (North Carolina), upon a jury verdict, found defendant guilty of, among other things, first-degree felony murder. In a separate capital sentencing proceeding, one mitigating and three aggravating circumstances were found and he was sentenced to, among other things, death. The North Carolina Supreme Court allowed his motion to bypass the court of appeals as to his appeal of additional judgments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Codefendants with plea arrangements testified that defendant was told of a plan to steal from a residence, was interested, and recruited one of them. The three, with another, went to the house, but felt thwarted by the resident's presence. The recruit suggested they break in and subdue her. The original planner was concerned about being identified. Defendant suggested that a dead person could not talk. The recruit said he would kill her, and with defendant burst in and beat her. Defendant shot her twice and was arrested after he and his recruit tried to withdraw money from her account. The supreme court held that the prosecutor, in sentencing arguments, impermissibly commented on defendant's invocation of his right to silence, and the trial court wrongly failed to intervene ex mero motu. As voir dire was conducted individually, the prosecutor's remarks to 16 veniremembers about defendant's right to testify did not constitute improper &quot;extended comment.&quot; Although veniremembers were unable to articulate their bias against capital punishment clearly, they were properly challenged for cause because their answers contained strong reservations about capital punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction of first-degree murder was upheld. The death sentence was set aside and the case was remanded for a new capital sentencing proceeding on the first-degree murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

When defendant refused to allow the detective to examine his shoes, the detective left defendant waiting in an interrogation room with the door closed and an officer outside while he obtained a search warrant. When the detective returned, he seized defendant's shoes and left him in the same room with the door closed and the officer outside. After examining the shoes, the detective arrested defendant. Defendant then confessed to the murder. On appeal, the supreme court found the detective properly seized the shoes pursuant to the plain view doctrine and subject to a search incident to a lawful arrest because defendant was placed under &quot;arrest&quot; at the moment his shoes were seized. Further, defendant's arrest was supported by probable cause. Therefore, defendant's confession was not obtained through an illegal seizure or arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary and second-degree kidnapping as an aider and abettor for both, and possession of a weapon of mass destruction; acquitted of first-degree murder and conspiracy charges; and sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of 124 to 146, 85 to 99, and 16 to 20 months respectively. The North Carolina Court of Appeals ordered a new trial. The State's and defendant's petitions for review were allowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Given the rule that unless favorable to the State, defendant's evidence was not to be considered on sufficiency review, the record showed that defendant: spent the day with his friend, armed himself when he saw his friend arm himself, clad only in black accompanied his friend that night to a home, stood by holding his shotgun while his friend argued with the friend's ex-girlfriend and pointed his pistol at her, followed his friend into the home and stood inside armed while his friend shot a man numerous times, drove his friend and the abducted woman away remarking that his friend should have killed her too, hid the murder weapon, and returned to his friend's hotel room with clothes for the woman whom his friend raped. The North Carolina Supreme Court held that this showed that defendant had the requisite criminal intent to aid his friend. Because his indictment did not charge the statutory factors for an enhancement, nor were they submitted to the jury, the trial court improperly imposed a N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.16A enhanced sentence in violation of Apprendi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

On appeal, judgment on his larceny convictions was arrested and a new capital sentencing proceeding granted. The Superior Court, Polk County (North Carolina) jury found two N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several witnesses testified of defendant's plan to kill a rich man for money, and of defendant's admissions. Defendant admitted to telling his codefendant to lie and testified that he was remorseful and had not intended the killing. The jury found that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in first-degree burglary and armed robbery. Upon resentencing he was sentenced to death. The North Carolina Supreme Court held that although the jury selection procedure violated N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1214, defendant had been provided the chance to follow the procedure and chosen not to. Denial of a challenge for cause of a juror who said she could put out of her mind the previous sentence was proper. Certain defense question were improper attempts to pin down prospective jurors as to specific mitigators. Prospective jurors unwilling to consider the death penalty were properly excused. Previous testimony of a now-unavailable witness was admissible. An allegation of what the victim had told his attackers was within the State's opening statement's proper scope. The State could suggest prison life was not harsh enough, and tell the jury not to be numb to this crime's violence.</SPAN></P>

In 1988, defendant shot and killed his second wife, for which he was convicted and sentenced nine years later. The North Carolina Supreme Court held that defendant waived his right to a competency hearing by not asserting it. Evidence of past treatment alone was not substantial evidence that he was incompetent. State explanations for peremptory challenges were race-neutral. The victim's diary was admissible under the state-of-mind hearsay exception. Five days notice from the State to defendant, of its intent to introduce statements of four witnesses who had died, was adequate. The statements were reliable and probative. Defendant's argument that based on his desire to reconcile with the victim, it was possible that a conflict erupted between the two, was not sufficient to negate premeditation and deliberation evidence and warrant a second-degree murder instruction. Evidence including photos relating to the prior murder was properly admissible at sentencing. The jury was properly instructed as to unanimity. The sentence was proportional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for three counts of first-degree murder, and was tried capitally, in the Superior Court, Wake County (North Carolina), and found guilty on the basis of premeditation and deliberation and under the felony murder rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed two victims after searching a victim's home for weapons, and an accomplice killed a third victim. After defendant's arrest, he was given Miranda warnings, and confessed to an unrelated burglary three hours later. He was given lunch, and, six and one-half hours after the Miranda warnings, confessed to the murders. The Miranda warnings were not stale at the time of the murder confession. The short-form indictment used, and authorized by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15-144, was constitutional. During voir dire, defendant could not properly ask prospective jurors their verdict under a given set of facts, or inquire into all aspects of their private lives or religious beliefs. When defense counsel and defendant reached an impasse over rehabilitating a panel member who said she would base her decision on emotional sympathy for the victims, defendant's decision controlled. Trial court's failure to intervene ex mero motu in prosecutor's argument was not error, and, when prosecutor commented defendant had a right to testify, it was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.

There was sufficient evidence of aggravating circumstances because defendant's actions were calculated to torture the victim psychologically and to leave her aware that she was helpless to prevent impending death, and the method chosen by defendant to carry out the killing was conscienceless and pitiless, inflicting excessive fear and psychological torture. The trial court did not err in deferring its ruling on whether introduction of certain evidence by defendant would permit the State to introduce irrelevant and prejudicial evidence because defendant's decision not to introduce the evidence was purely tactical and did not implicate any of his rights.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no reasonable probability that any of the alleged errors of defense counsel affected the outcome of the trial. Thus, defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was denied. Defendant's pretrial motion to suppress and motion in limine were not sufficient to preserve questions for the appeal. In the absence of any evidence suggesting that defendant was incompetent, the trial court did not err in deciding not to order the mental health evaluation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the court on appeal from the trial court's order granting attorney's fees to counsel representing prevailing plaintiffs in a class action against the State. Appellant, as attorney general for the State, challenged the fees awarded to opposing counsel and whether such fees were excessive. The case commenced nearly a decade before as a certified class action involving approximately 200,000 class members who alleged that a tax imposed on their retirement benefits was illegal. The State agreed to a settlement which provided an award of attorney's fees to class counsel of $ 63,920,000. The agreement signed by the State also contained a waiver clause which stated attorney's fees would be determined by the court and the State, as represented by the attorney general, waiving any rights to be heard concerning these matters. The court found this language to bar appellant from any claim to the attorney's fee award, and despite his common law powers, he had no power to act to defend the people's interest. The court further found appellant had no power to intervene under N.C. R. Civ. P. 24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeal dismissed. Appellant lacked standing to challenge the fees awarded, based upon his waiver to contest the award signed as part of the settlement agreement. His service as state counsel did not grant him extraordinary power to take actions necessary for the protection of the public interest.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. Defendant was present when the proceeding in question took place. The trial court heard from counsel and responded in open court to each of the communications. The fair and accurate disclosure of the substantive content of the communications was sufficient to render counsel the full opportunity to effectively represent defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1987, defendant was convicted of first degree murder and he was sentenced to death. Three years later, upon the United States Supreme Court's remand of the case, the court vacated defendant's sentence of death and remanded for a new capital sentencing proceeding. The sentencing jury again recommended a sentence of death. Defendant appealed as of right. Concluding that defendant's capital resentencing proceeding was free of prejudicial error and that the death sentence was not disproportionate under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(d)(20) (1999), the court upheld defendant's sentence of death. The court specifically held that the State did not engage in prosecutorial misconduct in conducting discovery and defendant had no right to be present during the preliminary qualification of prospective jurors. Further, although defendant could not have received the death penalty for his 1966 plea of guilty to murder, such crime was still a &quot;capital felony&quot; for purposes of the aggravator, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(2) (1999).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; although defendant pled guilty to murder and, under the now repealed statute, his case was not a &quot;capital case,&quot; the crime was still a &quot;capital felony&quot; for purposes of the aggravating circumstance. Furthermore, nothing in the record suggested that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor or was other disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error in the sentences for the following reasons. First, the indictments based on N.C. Gen.

Second, plaintiff's articulated reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges did not appear to have been motivated by purposeful discrimination, but appeared both race-neutral and otherwise beyond reproach.

After a capital sentencing proceeding the jury recommended death and the trial court entered such judgment. Defendant appealed, arguing disproportionality; that the short-form murder indictment was constitutionally inadequate to charge him with first-degree murder; that statements by the court diluted the responsibility of the jury, and the court abused its discretion by allowing some voir dire questions from the state and preventing defendant from asking others; that the state excluded jurors based on race; and the state's closing argument was prejudicial based on its reference to Biblical law; among other arguments. After noting that defendant had failed to object during trial and thus preserve many of the issues for review, the court found that the short-form murder indictment was in compliance with the North Carolina and U.S. Constitutions, that defendant's death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate, and that defendant received a fair trial and capital sentencing proceeding free from prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court, Onslow County (North Carolina), imposing a sentence of death upon a jury verdict finding defendant guilty of first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder on the basis of premeditation and deliberation and under the felony-murder rule, first-degree burglary, and conspiracy to commit first-degree burglary, for killing a man in his home during an attempt to steal drugs. The trial court sentenced defendant to death for the murder. On appeal, the court determined that the trial court did not err in finding that defendant voluntarily confessed to police, or in denying defendant's motion for individual voir dire and sequestration of the jurors during voir dire. The trial court did not err in admitting photographs of the victim that depicted the large number of wounds and also corroborated defendant's confession. Submission of the aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed to avoid lawful arrest was proper because the evidence showed the victim was killed so he would not report the burglary. The death penalty was not disproportionate, given the finding of premeditation and deliberation and the fact that defendant killed the defenseless victim in his home.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was left undisturbed because defendant's trial and capital sentencing proceeding were free from prejudicial error and the death penalty was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the driving while impaired charge. The District Court, Craven County (North Carolina) denied defendant's motion to dismiss or to suppress, and defendant was found guilty. Defendant appealed the judgment of the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which found no error in defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it was constitutionally permissible for an officer to stop a vehicle which had made a legal turn away from a posted driving while impaired checkpoint. The officer observed a &quot;quick left turn&quot; away from the checkpoint at the precise point where the driver of the vehicle would have first become aware of its presence. However, the officer did not stop defendant's vehicle once it turned away from the checkpoint. In fact, the court could not conclude that the officer &quot;stopped&quot; defendant's vehicle at any point. Defendant voluntarily parked in a residential driveway and remained hidden in the car until the officer approached the vehicle. Therefore, defendant was not &quot;seized&quot; by the police officer until at least that point. Also, based upon that series of incriminating circumstances, the officer observed sufficient activity to raise a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity. Therefore, the court found no error in defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment modified and affirmed; it was constitutionally permissible for officer to make an investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle which had turned away, attempting to avoid a driving while impaired checkpoint. Based on the totality of the circumstances the officer had reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity. Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death on each of nine counts of first-degree murder. He had confessed to the murders. The supreme court found that the short-form indictments used for the murder charges and to charge other crimes were constitutional; U.S. Const. amend. XIV did not require an indictment to list all elements or facts which might increase the maximum punishment for a crime. The trial court acted properly in denying a change of venue and in denying defendant's motion to suppress his confession; the confession was not the result of a delay in taking defendant before a magistrate. Defendant was not prejudiced by references made during cross-examination of defense experts to additional murders to which defendant had confessed. The pattern instructions given on deliberation adequately covered the substance of defendant's requested instructions. There was no error in instructions given during the sentencing proceeding on mitigating and aggravating circumstances, nor did the prosecution's sentencing phase closing argument require a mistrial. The death sentences were not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed. The trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion for a peremptory instruction on mitigating circumstances.

However, the trial court did not conduct that inquiry; [3]-The imposition of satellite-based monitoring had to be vacated, and the case remanded for the trial court to conduct the necessary reasonableness inquiry described in the case law.</SPAN></P>
