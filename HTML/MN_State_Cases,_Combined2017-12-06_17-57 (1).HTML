</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the Washington County District Court (Minnesota) which denied his motion to suppress and convicted him of driving while intoxicated, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.121 (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered a restricted residential area that had been established by police after a damaging storm and was subsequently arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and driving with an alcohol concentration of .10 in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.121 (1996). Appellant challenged the lower court's denial of his suppression motion, arguing that the evidence was obtained in violation of his U.S. Const. amend IV rights because the restricted area was an illegal checkpoint. He further argued the city regulations establishing the restricted area were invalid, unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and violated his due process and equal protection rights. The affirming court found the facts of this case demonstrated the reasonableness of appellant's stop under either federal or state law. Arguably, the public interest in having a checkpoint-type stop to protect a damaged area following a storm was stronger than for the typical checkpoint. Even under the more stringent state standard, appellant's seizure was reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed; checkpoint stop passed constitutional muster because the public had a strong interest in protecting the storm-damaged residential area from criminal activity. Any privacy invasion was minimal to individuals stopped at the checkpoint who were merely asked for identification and warned to stay away if they were nonresidents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Litigation by respondent State and health insurers against appellant tobacco companies involved identification of many millions of documents for production in discovery. The trial court issued protective orders to encourage cooperation, but later determined that appellants had used these orders to evade their obligations to produce evidence. In the meantime, the United States Congress had obtained many documents covered by protective orders and posted them on the Internet. After entry of consent judgment, the trial court modified its protective orders to allow public access to many documents. The appellate court held that the issuing court had broad discretion in fashioning and modifying protective orders, that the materials to be released were simply databases not prepared with any strategic intent in contemplating litigation, that appellants' arguments were moot as to all documents on the Internet, that claims of attorney-client privilege were vitiated by the crime-fraud exception, and that the documents for which constitutional claims were made were not protected confidential information because respondents did not come by them in the normal course of business.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in lifting the protective orders and the disclosure order did not amount to an unconstitutional taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Crow Wing County District Court (Minnesota) dismissing appellant's complaint challenging the forfeiture of his vehicle following a DWI offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the dismissal of his complaint challenging the forfeiture of his vehicle. Appellant argued that respondent's procedural errors violated his right to due process or entitled him to relief from the forfeiture, and a DWI-related vehicle forfeiture under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.1217 violated the state constitution's double jeopardy clause. Applying a three-part balancing test that weighed the private and government interests and the availability of additional procedural safeguards, the court found appellant's due process argument without merit. Appellant argued that the forfeiture of his vehicle, after he had been convicted and sentenced for misdemeanor DWI, constituted double punishment. The state constitution referred to jeopardy of &quot;punishment,&quot; rather than &quot;life or limb.&quot; Appellant cited no authority that this was intended to extend double jeopardy protections to civil sanctions. The court declined to read the state double jeopardy clause more broadly than its federal counterpart. Judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed because appellant was not denied his right to procedural due process and the forfeiture of appellant's vehicle following his conviction and sentence for DWI did not violate the double jeopardy provision of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One evening, police were dispatched to appellant's motel room after a woman called and stated that a man in the room assaulted her. The police responded to the dispatch, entered the room, went straight to appellant, handcuffed him, and then pat searched him. One officer discovered cocaine in appellant's pocket and in his wallet. Appellant was charged with first-degree controlled substance crime. Appellant moved to suppress the evidence. The court denied appellant's motion. On appeal, the court reversed the decision. The court held a seizure occurred when a reasonable person did not believe he was free to leave. The court held the police had to have reasonable, articulable suspicions of criminal activity to make a limited stop or seizure for investigatory purposes. Here, the police did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion that appellant was armed and dangerous. Accordingly, the court determined the search was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Law-enforcement officers executed a warrant to search defendant's residence. The officers found 47.5 grams of cocaine in defendant's bedroom. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence, and the district court denied his motion. Defendant appealed his conviction of a controlled substance offense. Defendant argued that his constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures had been violated. The appellate court found that the officers executed a valid search warrant, knocked repeatedly, identified themselves as law enforcement, and waited a reasonable time before entry and; therefore, the search was not rendered unconstitutional by the fact that the officers failed to announce their authority and purpose until they were just across the threshold of the residence. The officers' actions did not seriously offend the purposes served by the announcement principal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, nude dancers and patrons of a nude-dancing bar, appealed their indecent conduct convictions by challenging Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.23(a)(3) (1996) as unconstitutionally applied to them and as overbroad by prohibiting protected forms of expression. Defendants argued that the statute required an intent to offend and that they had no reason to know that their conduct disobeyed the law. The court held that defendants' assertion relied on an erroneous interpretation of prior law, and that the court never suggested that consensual exposure was not prohibited when it constituted openly lewd or lascivious behavior. The court held that appellant's behavior was not constitutionally protected conduct. Because lewd and lascivious behavior was synonymous with obscene behavior, and obscene behavior, conduct, or speech was not protected under the First Amendment, U.S. Const. art. I, it could be regulated by Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.23.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to driving while intoxicated, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.121, subds. 1(a), 3(c)(1) (1996). After his probation from that conviction was revoked, defendant argued he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because the district court erred in denying his request for a public defender without first determining whether obtaining private counsel would constitute a substantial hardship to him and he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to counsel. The court found since defendant earned $ 500- $ 700 a week, hiring an attorney would not constitute substantial hardship, so the lower court's failure to properly inquire into whether an attorney would create a hardship was not an abuse of discretion. Since defendant was fully aware of the consequences of proceeding pro se and the record indicated he adequately understood the charges against him, the waiver was knowing and intelligent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State challenged the Nicollet County District Court's (Minnesota) pretrial order dismissing charges of felony nonsupport of a child and misdemeanor criminal contempt against respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was charged by appellant State with felony nonsupport of a child, and misdemeanor criminal contempt. The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of probable cause, concluding the charges could not be pursued because the supreme court had ruled that Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.5511 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that although the state supreme court had held that the administrative child-support process under Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.5511 was unconstitutional, the supreme court had also determined that the judgment should not be effective and the administrative child support process should remain in place until July 1, 1999. Respondent was ordered in September 1997 to provide child support pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.5511. Thus, the supreme court decision did not invalidate his child-support order or render the order unenforceable. Thus, the district court erred in dismissing the complaint against respondent on that basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pretrial order reversed and remanded; judgment that the administrative child-support process was unconstitutional was not effective until July 1, 1999, therefore, since respondent was ordered in September 1997 to provide child support, the judgment did not invalidate his child-support order or render the order unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">1996 Minn. Laws ch. 407, &sect; 32 created a recreation area on land near appellants' property. Appellants filed a complaint to enjoin respondent commissioner from establishing the recreation area. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Appellants failed to meet their burden of showing that the statute violated the title requirement of the Minnesota Constitution, because the title heading together with the specific statutory notations were sufficient to notify readers that the recreation area was established. The court determined that the statute met the &quot;mere filament&quot; test and did not violate the single-subject requirement of the Minnesota Constitution, because the statute was not overbroad and the areas of environment, natural resources, and agriculture were found to be closely related to one another and constituted one subject. The statute was not special legislation because the statute passed the rational-basis test.</SPAN></P>

The administrative law judge used a salary survey to determine appellant's income. Appellant contended on appeal that the use of a salary survey rather than the financial information he provided was an abuse of discretion and that the reviewing administrative law judge's order which required appellant to pay a small sum to the state as reimbursement for medical assistance was improper.

The amendment had been effective January 1, 1998. Respondent successfully moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that there was no longer an applicable gross misdemeanor DWI statute. The court held that: (1) because when a statutory amendment is held unconstitutional, the predecessor statute is revived in the form in which it existed before the amendment, respondent had been lawfully charged under the predecessor statute that had revived upon the supreme court's decision; and (2) the revival of the superceded statute did not interfere with due process of law.</SPAN></P>

In reversing and remanding district court's order rescinding respondent's driver's-license revocation, the court held that respondent lacked standing to bring constitutional challenge. The court found that although respondent argued that the statutory limits on discovery prohibited his ability to present his case at the implied-consent hearing, he did not attempt to conduct any discovery outside the parameters of the statute and existence of the statute alone did not necessarily mean that respondent was harmed, or would be harmed, by its application. The court found that contrary to respondent's contention, he was not precluded from making a good-faith attempt to obtain additional discovery; and respondent did not demonstrate the imminent harm necessary for standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutory discovery provisions.</SPAN></P>

It did so after finding that his petition was barred as untimely under Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.01, subds. 4(a)(1), (c) (2010). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of refusal to test. Less than a year later, he moved for a corrected sentence. The trial court denied that motion. Defendant did not directly appeal either his conviction or the denial of his motion for a corrected sentence. More than six years after he filed his motion for a corrected sentence, defendant petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief from his conviction. He alleged that his guilty plea was the result of constitutional violations. The trial court denied his postconviction petition upon finding that it was time barred under Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.01, subds. 4(a)(1), (c) (2010) setting forth the amount of time for filing a postconviction petition. The appellate court found that because a convicted defendant did not have a constitutional right to appeal under either the United States or the Minnesota Constitution, Minnesota's two-year time limitation to petition for postconviction relief in Minn. Stat. &sect; 590.01, subd. 4 (2010) was not unconstitutional, even if it precluded defendants from raising constitutional-violation claims that had not been reviewed on direct appeal or in a postconviction proceeding.</SPAN></P>

XIV. The court of appeals disagreed. The United States Supreme Court never held that the Due Process Clause required the appointment of counsel for a person who was the subject of a civil-commitment proceeding, nor has the Minnesota Supreme Court so held. Patient could not obtain habeas relief on the ground that his appellate attorney's failure to file a timely notice of appeal was a violation of the Due Process Clause. The petition for a writ of habeas corpus must have alleged a lack of jurisdiction or a constitutional violation and neither the United States Supreme Court nor the Minnesota Supreme Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment created a right to the effective assistance of counsel for a person who is the subject of a civil-commitment proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police executing a search warrant for defendants' residence found them at a table packaging a green leafy substance. When their mouths were examined, police found remnants of a leafy substance and noted that their tongues were green. They arrested both defendants. Chemical testing later determined that the leafy substance, &quot;khat,&quot; contained cathinone, a Schedule I controlled substance. Defendants were each charged with fifth-degree controlled substance crime. The trial court then found each of them guilty in a trial before it. The appellate court held that khat, whether it be a material under Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.02, subd. 2(6) (2008), or a mixture under Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.025, subd. 2(1) (2008) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.01, subd. 9a (2008), contained cathinone, a controlled substance classified in schedule I, the possession of which was prohibited by Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.025, subd. 2(1) (2008). As a result, it found that they were lawfully found guilty of a fifth-degree controlled substance crime and their crimes could not be excused under the Free Exercise of Religion or Equal Protection clauses of the United States Constitution since the state could lawfully regulate such possession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a matter of first impression, defendant argued, inter alia, that the district court erred by refusing to suppress evidence of his identity that was discovered during a limited search of his person. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant was a person found attempting to enter a night club with a cocked, loaded concealed handgun. That defendant was in possession of a loaded handgun gave police officers a basis to suspect criminal activity and make a lawful demand for identification under Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.714, subd. 1b. Defendant was suspected of possessing a firearm in public without a permit, a gross misdemeanor, but would not provide officers with identification. Thus, the only way officers could have issued a citation was to arrest defendant or conduct a limited search for identification. Officers could have arrested defendant, rendering any subsequent search incident to the arrest valid. Because defendant's possession of a handgun provided reasonable suspicion to detain defendant and make a demand for identification, and because defendant refused the officers' request for identification, police were justified in conducting a limited search for identification.</SPAN></P>

The statute criminalized communicating false information regarding police misconduct but did not also criminalize communicating false statements supportive of police conduct. The distinction between false critical information and false exonerating information discriminated based on the viewpoint of the speaker. Further, the statute did not fit under any recognized exception to content discrimination--(1) situations in which the viewpoint or content distinction was limited to and addressed the essence of why the speech was proscribable in the first place; (2) situations where secondary effects justified the regulation without reference to the content of speech; and (3) situations where the nature of the content discrimination was such that there was no realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas was afoot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a bridge designer's successor, challenged the denial by the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) of its motion to dismiss the cross-claims of respondent Minnesota Department of Transportation (the state) for contractual contribution and indemnity and for statutory reimbursement arising out of the collapse of an interstate highway bridge. The successor argued, in part, that Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051 (2008) barred the state's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the bridge-design contracts, the designer agreed to indemnify the state for any and all claims arising out of the bridge's performance. Construction of the bridge was substantially completed in 1967. In 2007, the bridge collapsed. Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3.7391-.7395 (2008) were passed to compensate survivors of the collapse, and the state sought reimbursement. On appeal, the court determined that the 2007 amendments to &sect; 541.051 applied retroactively to revive indemnity and contribution actions and therefore the state's claims for contractual contribution and indemnity and for statutory reimbursement were not time-barred. In addition, the successor had no vested right to repose, so the retroactive application of &sect; 541.051 did not violate the successor's due-process rights. Because the bridge-design contract provided that the designer would indemnify the state, the compensation statutes passed after the collapse of the bridge did not unconstitutionally impair the contract. In &sect; 3.7394, subd. 5(a), the legislature clearly stated its intent to supersede all statutes and the common law in allowing the state to pursue reimbursement of payments made under the compensation statutes.</SPAN></P>

The citizen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator was a nonprofit corporation that operated a residential treatment facility for juvenile sex offenders. It planned to build a new facility near its current location. The citizen, a nearby resident of the proposed new facility, opposed it in remarks she made at public hearings and on her two websites. She stated that a juvenile in its care died at the hands of one of its employees and that the operator was getting away with murder. The operator sued her for defamation. The trial court denied her motion to dismiss filed under Minnesota's anti-SLAPP statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 554.01 et seq. (2008). The appellate court found that the trial court, in concluding that the anti-SLAPP statute required it to determine by clear and convincing evidence whether she defamed the operator before full discovery could be had without submitting the case to the jury, erred in finding that the statute violated respondent's constitutional rights to due process and a jury trial. It so concluded because it found the law allowed citizen participation in government and only immunized citizens concerning limited, protected speech and found that further proceedings on the lawsuit were required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.117, subd. 1(2), as applied to a juvenile who was adjudicated delinquent of a misdemeanor arising from the same set of circumstances as a charged felony, did not authorize an unreasonable search. Accordingly, appellant failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute violated the protections against unreasonable searches and seizures established by the Fourth Amendment and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Appellant's equal protection challenge also failed because she did not identify the similarly situated persons to whom she compared herself. The juvenile was not similarly situated to those who had been adjudicated delinquent for a misdemeanor but were not also charged with a felony. In analyzing the equal protection claim, the court applied the rational relation test, finding that a juvenile who had been adjudicated delinquent for a misdemeanor arising from the same set of circumstances as a charged felony had a reduced expectation of privacy and did not have a fundamental right to be free from DNA collection for the purpose of identification.</SPAN></P>

The worker did not complain about the set-aside and did not argue that he had a statutory right to a hearing; he challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 245C.27, subd. 1(a), as applied to him, and argued that the failure to provide him a hearing to challenge the underlying disqualification violated his right to due process. The court agreed and concluded that the balance of the Mathews v. Eldridge factors favored the worker and that he therefore had a due-process right to a hearing to challenge his underlying disqualification. Employment in his chosen field was significant and weighed in his favor. Because the worker had no prior conviction, he had not had an opportunity to challenge the charges against him; therefore, an evidentiary hearing would have been highly valuable and written submissions an unsatisfactory basis for decision. Although the burden of an administrative proceeding weighed in favor of the Department, the overall balance of the factors weighed in favor of the worker.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At his first trial, defendant's counsel agreed to certain stipulated facts. Because of the stipulations, the State started its examination of the arresting officer at a point where the officer actually arrested defendant and took him to jail. At the end of the trial, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that there was no evidence that a breath-test result was produced within two hours of the time defendant was in physical control of the vehicle. The district court sua sponte declared a mistrial, indicating that the case was presented in an unacceptable format that smacked of trickery. The court overturned the convictions on retrial. When a district court declared a mistrial sua sponte without the defendant's consent and without considering less drastic alternatives, the Double-Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. V and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, prohibited retrial of the defendant.

The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. The jury could have inferred from the surreptitious manner of defendant's receipt and storage of the khat that he was distributing it secretly, taking careful steps to conceal both his possession and distribution. This supported a rational finding that defendant knew that his dried khat contained a controlled substance. Defendant did not ask the district court for a Frye-Mack hearing or object to the expert's testimony regarding the methods used to test the khat. Defendant could not establish plain error because the district court's alleged omission of not conducting a Frye-Mack hearing sua sponte did not affect his substantial rights. Additionally, defendant's argument that Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 152.025, subd. 2 and 152.02, subd. 2(6), which criminalized possession of cathinone, were unconstitutionally vague was rejected.

The district court sentenced defendant to serve 180 months in prison, an upward departure from the 98-month presumptive sentence, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that it exercised its jurisdiction to review defendant's Apprendi-Blakely argument in the interests of justice. Defendant argued that a determination that an out-of-state conviction was for a violent crime under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2, was similar to a determination that an offender's convictions constituted a pattern of criminal conduct under &sect; 609.1095, subd. 4. An imposition of an enhanced sentence based on a district court's finding of a pattern of criminal conduct violated a defendant's U.S. Const. amend. VI right to trial by jury. The appellate court concluded that a district court may determine that an out-of-state conviction for a violent crime without violating an offender's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. The district court's implicit reliance on an unproven statement in the presentence-investigation report (PSI) as a basis for aggravated sentencing under &sect; 609.1095, subd. 2, violated defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial on any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that although the stalking provision in &sect; 609.749, subd. 2(a)(2) was broad and in limited circumstances might extend to expression-related conduct, because it focused on wrongful conduct, protected rights of the victim, and was subject to limiting construction, the statute was not unconstitutionally void for facial overbreadth. Moreover, because the provision in &sect; 609.749, subd. 2(a)(2) provided sufficient notice that specific conduct was criminal, the statute was not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. Defendant's conviction was based on her driving conduct, not her words to the victim in a parking lot. Because the conduct underlying the conviction was not expressive conduct, the challenge to the statute as applied to defendant failed. The record supported the jury's conclusion that defendant was guilty of stalking under &sect; 609.749, subd. 2(a)(2). The testimony showed that defendant (1) followed the victim dangerously close for several blocks; (2) refused to pass when provided an opportunity; (3) continued to follow the victim into her workplace parking lot; (4) accosted the victim; and (5) made threatening statements to the victim based on her apparent religion.</SPAN></P>

The complaint primarily asserted that the per diem increases violated Minn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2007, committees in both houses of the Minnesota Legislature approved an increase to the maximum per diem allowance for their members' living expenses. The increases were effective immediately. The court found that there was subject-matter jurisdiction over appellants' claims and that the separation-of-powers doctrine did not preclude the exercise of that jurisdiction. The action fell within the narrow confines of taxpayer standing because appellants challenged a specific disbursement of money, alleging that it was wrongful. The association also had associational standing. Appellants' claims were not moot. The court held that the per diem increases did not violate the Minnesota Constitution because per diem payments, even when increased significantly, did not constitute increased compensation. The court agreed with courts from other jurisdictions that judicial intervention should be limited to cases in which the conclusion was inevitable without the aid of extrinsic facts and circumstances that the real intent and purpose of the appropriation was to increase the compensation of the legislators.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued that using his prior implied-consent license revocations to enhance a misdemeanor driving-while-impaired charge to a felony was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed, holding that because defendant had the opportunity for meaningful judicial review of the revocation of his driving privileges, use of the revocation as an aggravating factor did not violate his due-process rights. Defendant did not dispute that the three revocations occurred, and requiring the State to prove each underlying fact of the revocations would have essentially required a separate trial within a trial on each revocation in order to enhance a DWI charge: such an approach was both impractical and unnecessary. Moreover, Apprendi did not require that of the facts surrounding the license revocations to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The only fact that had to be proved was the existence of the revocation. As the officer had probable cause to believe defendant had been driving while impaired, and as he had an opportunity for judicial review of the revocation, which he waived, the use of his first license revocation to enhance the current offense was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judicial officer ruled that the noncompete and nonsolicitation provisions were unreasonable and could not be made reasonable using the blue-pencil doctrine. The judicial officer also ruled that the employer's client list, which the employee had used to notify his clients that he was leaving the employer, was not a trade secret. The appellate court ruled that permitting the judicial officer to determine the matter by granting summary judgment violated the constitutional mandate that the jurisdiction of judicial officers be inferior to the district court. By granting summary judgment, the judicial officer determined the action between the parties and rendered a final judgment that was appealable in the same manner as other final orders of the district court. When the judicial officer exercised jurisdiction over the matter by granting summary judgment, the jurisdiction that he exercised was not inferior to the jurisdiction of the district court, which violated the requirement in Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the proprietor of a bar and organized an event at which participants/ customers smoked cigarettes in his bar. Defendant argued that his customers' smoking was within the theatrical-performance exception to the Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act (the Act). The appellate court ruled that the district court did not clearly err in its findings of fact and did not err in its interpretation of the Act. The conduct of the customers was not within the theatrical-performance exception to the Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act's prohibition on smoking in bars. The district court succinctly described its ruling by stating that the Minnesota Legislature did not intend the theatrical production exception to Minn. Stat. &sect; 144.417 to become a blanket exception simply by having patrons in a bar put on name tags indicating the word actor. The customers of the bar were grouped up and socializing in the normal fashion of patronizing a bar. No one present indicated when the theatrical production started, and there were no other indicators that a play or theatrical production was taking place. There were no scripts or indicators setting the theatrical production apart from normal bar activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proposed patient was diagnosed with epilepsy, and his family noticed that he was experiencing auditory hallucinations. The proposed patient was taken to the hospital and discharged, and later charged with murder and attempted murder. The district court found that immunity under Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.23, subd. 4 (2008), applied to respondents' good-faith decision to not place a 72-hour emergency hold on the proposed patient, and that statutory immunity precluded a common-law claim of medical negligence. The appellate court ruled that statutory immunity barred claims that were related to the alleged failure to institute a hold on the proposed patient. The good-faith determination that the proposed patient did not meet the statutory criteria for an emergency hold qualified as an act pursuant to any provision of the Minnesota Commitment and Treatment Act (CTA). The CTA provided complete immunity from suit, not simply a defense to liability. Also, the claimants failed to show that common-law medical-negligence claims were separate and distinct from claims arising out of the CTA, and therefore the former could survive the application of statutory immunity.</SPAN></P>

Concluding that the district court was examining respondent's right to treatment, appellants contended that respondent's claim was not ripe. To the extent that respondent's argument involved his right to treatment, the court agreed that the issue was not ripe because the district court had not found that he met the commitment criteria. To the extent that the district court identified, separate from a right to treatment inquiry, a substantive due process standard that permitted a pre-commitment investigation of the purpose of the SDP/SPP statutes by examining past and present treatment standards, the court held that governing case law did not permit weighing a proposed patient's prospective treatment based on a substantive due process theory that measured treatment in practice by examining the experience of other patients.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a coalition of cities, brought a declaratory judgment action against respondent, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), challenging the adoption of Minn. R. 7053.0255, subp. 4, governing discharge of phosphorus. An administrative law judge (ALJ) conducted hearings on the proposed rules, made findings, and recommended that the rules be adopted, and the MPCA citizens' board adopted the rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that the coalition had standing to bring a declaratory judgment action because it was not raising a hypothetical situation or a speculative claim of potential harm, but instead was citing the effects that an overbroad application of Minn. R. 7053.0255, subp. 4, would have on its municipalities, namely, requiring them to expend funds to upgrade, operate, and maintain wastewater facilities to comply with the rule. The coalition therefore demonstrated that the application of the rule could interfere with the cities' interests in obtaining exemptions. The court held that the three exemptions in the rule contained specific criteria that would constitute a reasonably clear policy or standard of action for the MPCA's staff to follow in evaluating an application for an exemption. The rule did not give the MPCA &quot;unbridled discretion&quot; in granting exemptions as argued by the coalition. The manner in which the MPCA exercised its discretion in granting exemptions would evolve in the future. The court held that the MPCA more than adequately satisfied the notice requirements of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14.101, subd. 1 (2008) and 14.14, subds. 1, 1a (2008).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant's parental rights to her two children were involuntarily terminated in 1986 due to emotional problems that rendered her unable to parent. When the applicant sought employment at several facilities that provided foster-care services to mentally ill adults, she was investigated under the Department of Human Services Background Studies Act (BSA), Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 245C.01-.34 (2008), and was permanently disqualified from any position allowing direct contact with persons receiving human services, under Minn. Stat. &sect; 245C.15, subd. 1(a). The court held that, to the extent that the BSA barred the Commissioner from setting aside the disqualification of an individual whose parental rights were involuntarily terminated under circumstances where the Commissioner could set aside the disqualification if the individual's parental rights had been voluntarily terminated, the BSA denied equal protection of the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Dakota County District Court, Minnesota, convicted defendant of wrongfully obtaining public assistance. Defendant moved for reconsideration on the ground that Minn. Stat. &sect; 256J.20 (2004) was unconstitutionally vague. The district court denied the motion for reconsideration and imposed a sentence of, among other things, two days in jail and a restitution obligation in an amount to be determined. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the district court erred in its interpretation of the statute governing financial eligibility for public-assistance benefits, arguing that a 2007 amendment to Minn. Stat. &sect; 256J.20, subd. 3 (2004), should have been applied retroactively to the conduct for which she was convicted. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the plain meaning of the statute was not absurd. The legislature reasonably could have determined that using debt to acquire a motor vehicle, or using a motor vehicle as security for another type of loan, should not enhance a person's eligibility for public assistance. Thus, the district court did not err by applying the plain meaning of &sect; 256J.20, subd. 3. Because the legislature provided for a specific effective date for the 2007 amendment, the legislature did not intend for the amendment to apply to conduct occurring before the effective date. Thus, the 2007 amendment to &sect; 256J.20, subd. 3(1) did not apply retroactively to defendant's recertification application.</SPAN></P>

An administrative law judge concluded that the city had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that good cause existed for the city to impose conditions or restrictions against the business's license pursuant to Minneapolis, Minn., Code Ordinances 259.250(9) (2008).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the city's imposition of conditions on the business's liquor license based on the &quot;good cause&quot; standard in Minneapolis, Minn., Code Ordinances 259.250(9) violated the business's due process rights. The city had no basis to suspend or revoke the business's license and the good cause standard failed to provide adequate notice that the off-premises conduct of the business's patrons could result in adverse license action. The record indicated that the business took extensive security measures to protect its patrons. Moreover, it had not committed any violation of law or ordinance. The city also exceeded its express and implied legal authority by imposing conditions on the business's previously issued liquor license because no statute or ordinance authorized the city to condition a license when the city had no valid ground to suspend or revoke the license. Because the court's review on writ of certiorari was strictly limited to the city council's findings and decision, and because the business's additional constitutional and Minnesota Human Rights Act claims could be litigated in another forum, those additional claims were outside the scope of the court's review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer submitted a request to rezone property and for a permit to construct townhouses. The city planning and zoning commission recommended that the rezoning request be approved, subject to certain conditions, but the developer objected. The city council approved the rezoning request subject to the conditions and imposed additional conditions. The developer applied to the zoning board of appeals (ZBA) for a waiver of the conditions. The ZBA denied the requested relief, and the developer appealed to the city council, which affirmed the ZBA's decision in January 2001. In December 2006, the developer filed suit. On review of summary judgment entered in favor of the city, the court held that the developer's suit was timely commenced. Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.05, subd. 1 (2006), an action for compensation for a taking was subject to a six-year statute of limitations, and the statute of limitations commenced running only after the developer had exhausted all available avenues for relief through the local government. The statute of limitations began to run when the city council affirmed the ZBA's decision, and the developer's suit was filed within six years of that date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former inmate was arrested in Olmsted County and charged with three counts of aggravated robbery. He could not afford bail and was held in the Olmsted County Jail. After almost eight months, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison. The county charged him $ 25 for room and board for each day in the county jail, which amounted to $ 7,150. Minn. Stat. &sect; 641.12, subd. 3(a) (2008), provided that the county could require that an offender convicted of a crime pay the cost of his room and board. The inmate argued that the statute did not allow the county to charge him for costs of confinement that accrued before he was convicted. The court held that &sect; 641.12, subd. 3(a), was ambiguous because it could be interpreted as the inmate argued. However, reading &sect; 641.12 as a whole and interpreting subdivision 3(a) in light of subdivision 1, the court held that the county could require payment of costs before and after conviction. The court rejected the inmate's equal protection argument because the statute did not classify individuals based on indigence on its face. The court also rejected his due process argument because he did not identify any right that was deprived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator registered nurse worked for a program licensed by respondent Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). When the nurse was convicted of making terroristic threats and third-degree assault, the MDH disqualified him from employment that allowed direct contact with persons receiving services from programs licensed by the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) and the MDH. The nurse's request for reconsideration was denied, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the nurse contended he had a due process right to an evidentiary hearing to challenge his disqualification; the basis for his disqualification was arbitrary and capricious; and Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 245C.14-.15 (2006) was constitutionally overbroad. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the nurse did not assert that he had any evidence of his innocence, and because his convictions required proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he was afforded due process incident to a criminal proceeding. Thus, procedural due process did not require that the DHS provide the nurse an evidentiary hearing on his disqualification. As Minn. Stat. &sect; 245C.22, subd. 4 (2006) allowed a disqualified individual to show that he had been rehabilitated and could be trusted to have direct contact with patients, the statute did not arbitrarily and capriciously deny the nurse of his occupation. As the population served by nurses was largely composed of infirm or otherwise vulnerable people, the state had an interest in preventing professionals guilty of assaultive behavior from working with them. As such, the nurse's disqualification based on his convictions did not sweep unnecessarily broadly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From a prior decision, a mandamus order was issued compelling appellant Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) to allow annexation of certain land by respondent City. Respondent developers subsequently filed a claim for damages and interest against the OAH. The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, denied the OAH's motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. The OAH appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the OAH contended, inter alia, that the district court no longer had jurisdiction because: money damages were not sought in the initial pleadings and the issue of damages was not raised in the first appeal, and the filing of the first appeal deprived the district court of further jurisdiction over the matter. The appellate court agreed, finding that neither the verified pleading nor the statement of reasons for intervention by the developers set forth a claim for money damages or stated the amount of damages sought. Thus, the developers failed to establish that the provision authorizing damages in a mandamus proceeding under Minn. Stat. &sect; 586.09 (2006) relieved them of that obligation. Further, to the extent that parties sought to preserve &quot;alternative theories&quot; for relief, they had an obligation to assert their claims before the appellate decision finally determined the action; thus, any potential claim for money damages was extinguished by the prior appellate decision. The developers' claim for damages was not collateral to the mandamus claim, and the district court lost jurisdiction to consider any such claim after the first appeal was taken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for going to his estranged wife's place of employment, a high school, in violation of an OFP. On appeal, the court held that defendant could not collaterally attack the OFP on which his conviction was based because he voluntarily dismissed his appeal of the OFP, and therefore the OFP was a final judgment and its constitutional validity stood as law of the case. Defendant could not collaterally attack the constitutionality of Minn. Stat. &sect; 518B.01, subd. 2(a)(2) because he failed to raise the issue when the OFP was issued. The court rejected defendant's contention that subd. 14(b) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because he did not identify any specific language that was unconstitutional. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting the scope of defendant's closing arguments because there was no evidence in the record that defendant did not intend to violate the OFP. The trial court erred by ordering that defendant's firearms be forfeited to the state and destroyed because 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 922(g)(8) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 518B.01, subd. 14(m), (j), (l) did not authorize the district court to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Stearns County District Court (Minnesota) of terroristic threats under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.713, subd. 1 (2006), misdemeanor domestic assault under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.2242, subd. 1(2) (2006), and interference with an emergency call under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.78, subd. 2 (2006). He was sentenced to a stayed 21-month prison term on the terroristic threats conviction, which was executed at defendant's request. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised various issues on appeal. The court reversed and remanded. Although there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's terroristic threats conviction, the trial court committed plain error in issuing an erroneous jury instruction. The trial court advised the jury that assault was a crime of violence, not that only assault in the first, second, and third degree were crimes of violence under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 1(d) (2006). It was necessary to inform the jury that not every assault was a crime of violence. To convict a defendant on a charge of felony terroristic threats, a jury had to find that the defendant threatened a specific predicate crime of violence and the jury had to be informed of the elements of that essential predicate offense, which was not done in this case. The court could not conclude that the error had no significant impact on the verdict. The court's decision that the State presented sufficient evidence on the charged elements did not overcome the concern that the jury was not given the opportunity to consider the critical question of whether defendant's statements satisfied the definition of a crime of violence or whether they did not.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 169A.51 pursuant to the administering of a routine preliminary breath test (PBT) upon appellant's arrest and booking for second-degree assault under Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court affirmed the license revocation. There was probable cause for the arrest for second-degree assault under Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.222, subd. 1, and 609.02, subd. 10. The jailer properly administered the PBT because Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.41 did not prohibit the jailer from testing intoxication and did not prohibit the result of such a test from being communicated to an officer. Further, the administration of the PBT was not a violation of his right against unreasonable searches under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. Protecting the safety of inmates and reducing exposure to liability were clear and legitimate government interests that outweighed any privacy interest of appellant. Finally, appellant's right to counsel was not violated when a deputy required him to decide if he would submit to an Intoxilyzer test because the deputy informed appellant that he had a right to contact an attorney and provided him with a telephone and directories to allow him to contact an attorney if he wanted. Based on the totality of the circumstances, the record supported the finding that the deputy vindicated appellant's right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

The employee did not have &quot;terms and conditions of employment,&quot; as that term was used in &sect; 179A.25, because she did not have an enforceable contractual right to not be terminated except for cause.

The Rice County District Court (Minnesota) dismissed the charge for lack of probable cause on the basis that the water contained in the post-use by-product of a methamphetamine bong, or water pipe, was not a mixture under Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.01, subd. 9a (2006). The State sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While searching defendant's home, officers discovered a glass bong, or water pipe, and a small bag containing methamphetamine. Inside the bong, the officers found a pink liquid, which tested positive for methamphetamine. The liquid weighed 37.17 grams and had a volume of 36 milliliters. Based on possession of the bong water, defendant was charged with possession. In granting defendant's motion to dismiss the charge, the district court concluded that since the water was part of the bong, it was drug paraphernalia, and the weight of the water could not be used as a basis for the possession crime. On appeal, the court found that the post-use by-product of a methamphetamine bong was essentially an infusion, like tea. Applying established canons of statutory construction, the court concluded that a mixture under &sect; 152.01, subd. 9a (2006) was something that was prepared for a particular purpose. Thus, since the post-use by-product of a methamphetamine bong was not a deliberate, nonaccidental, and non-incidental combination, it was not a mixture for these purposes. Accordingly, the court concluded that the possession charge was properly dismissed for lack of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DNR seized the licenses because the businessman wantonly wasted and destroyed fish. On appeal, the court held that the procedural-due-process challenge to Minn. Stat. &sect; 97A.420 (2006) was properly raised before the district court and the court on appeal. Minn. Stat. &sect; 97A.420, subd. 4(c), did not limit the subject-matter jurisdiction of Minnesota courts to consider constitutional issues inherent to the actions pending before them. Furthermore, the appeal was not moot as a result of the businessman's criminal conviction because the businessman raised an important public issue of statewide significance. The businessman's commercial fishing licenses represent protected property interests under the due process clauses of the Minnesota and federal constitutions. Although commercial licenseholders were entitled to due process of law when state action deprived them of the licenses, the range of procedural safeguards and appeal provisions in Minn. Stat. &sect; 97A.420 (2006) afforded adequate due process following seizure. Thus, the prehearing seizure of the businessman's commercial fishing license and the proceedings that followed did not violate his right to procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

On April 16, 2007, she was given notice to vacate the premises no later than the end of the lease term, June 30, 2007. When relator did not vacate the premises, the lessor filed an eviction action pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 504B.321. The HRA notified relator of the termination of her Section 8 Rental Assistance effective July 31, 2007. Relator contested the termination of her rental assistance. On August 24, 2007, an informal hearing occurred before a hearing officer. The HRA met its burden of proving by substantial evidence that relator's failure to vacate the leased premises at the expiration of her lease constituted a serious lease violation under 24 C.F.R. &sect; 982.552(b)(2), mandating the termination of her Section 8 Rental Assistance. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota found no merit in relator's claims that her constitutional rights were violated by either a deficient notice or an inability to cross-examine witnesses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree burglary under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.582, subd. 1(c) (2006) and found that the burglary was committed as part of a pattern of criminal conduct for purposes of an aggravated sentence under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 4 (2006). The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, sentenced defendant to the statutory-maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court held that the district court did not violate Blakely principles by determining whether defendant's out-of-state convictions were felonies under Minnesota law. However, for purposes of aggravated sentencing under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 4, the record was insufficient to establish that, of the 11 prior convictions, seven of the out-of-state convictions were felonies under Minnesota law. As to out-of-state convictions for burglary of an automobile, it was not clear whether that offense was a felony under Minnesota law and the record contained no additional evidence regarding the offenses. As to a conviction for receiving/possessing stolen property, the record did not show the value of the stolen property. As to a conviction for unlawful possession of a weapon, the existence of specific penalty factors could not be determined based on the record. The court also held that a &quot;pattern of criminal conduct&quot; was sufficiently established because defendant's seven other burglary convictions, and one attempted burglary conviction, shared similar characteristics with the current conviction. Defendant did not meet his burden on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed as to the aggravated sentence and remanded for a determination of whether defendant had the requisite number of prior felony convictions to support an aggravated sentence. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a conviction of third-degree criminal sexual conduct, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was in a position of authority over the victim under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.341, subd. 10 (2004). The appellate court disagreed and affirmed, stating that there was no question that defendant held a position of authority over victim, a cook at a restaurant that defendant assistant managed. The issue was whether defendant was in a position of authority at the time of the act. Defendant was the victim's direct supervisor and had the power to enforce work rules and exact obedience. The act occurred after work hours at the home of another restaurant employee. Defendant gave the victim beer and engaged the victim in a discussion regarding ways in which he could improve his behavior at work. The victim testified that he went along with defendant's advances because he was worried that he would be terminated if he refused. Thus, at the time of the act, defendant was in a position of authority over the victim. The fact that the act occurred off the work premises did not relieve defendant from his position of authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent churches sued appellant State, alleging that several provisions of the Minnesota Citizens' Personal Protection Act of 2005 violated Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, the First Amendment, and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc. The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) found in favor of the churches and issued a permanent injunction. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court properly held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.714, subds. 17(a), (b), (c), and (e), and 18(c), violated Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, as the notice, parking area, and tenant provisions significantly burdened their sincerely held religious beliefs and the State failed to show that permitting the churches to ban guns on church property was inconsistent with the articulated state interests in public safety, travel, and providing uniform communication about where guns were prohibited. The State also failed to show that the Act used the least restrictive means to achieve the state interests. The federal constitutional issues were not addressed given the affirmance on independent and adequate state grounds. The permanent injunction did not constitute an establishment of religion under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16, or U.S. Const. amend. I, as the determination that the churches were entitled to an exemption already afforded to possessors of private residence placed them on equal footing; it did not improperly favor or advance religion. The Act did not violate the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000cc, as it was not a zoning law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grant of a permanent injunction was affirmed on state constitutional grounds as applied to the churches' property, including related parking areas used ofr religious activities.

The statute prohibited conduct that obstructed, resisted, or interfered with a peace officer while the officer was engaged in the performance of official duties. The court rejected defendant's argument, stating that the statute clearly defined the actions that were prohibited and did not encourage discriminatory enforcement. Additionally, the statute did not infringe on constitutionally protected speech and was limited to words and conduct that physically interfered with an officer performing official duties. The court also rejected defendant's claim that she was denied her right to a fair trial because an independent investigation was not conducted. The court stated that there was no minimum number as to how many people should be interviewed at a crime scene to make the investigation adequate. Defendant also argued that the district court erred when it denied her request for a discriminatory-enforcement hearing. The court held that the record supported the conclusion that defendant was singled out for arrest and prosecution based on her actions, not because of her race or ethnicity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mother, who had custody of her child, died and respondent, the child's half sister, petitioned for custody of the child. Appellant, father, opposed the petition. The St. Louis County District Court, Minnesota, awarded custody to the sister by applying Minn. Stat. &sect; 257C.03, subd. 7 (2002), and Minn. Stat. &sect; 257C.04, subd. 1(c) (Supp. 2003). The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that awarding custody to the father would significantly endanger the child's emotional health and well being, and to allow the father unsupervised, unlimited parenting time at the present time would endanger the child's emotional health. The appellate court ruled that these findings were supported by expert testimony and associated documents. The record contained clear and convincing evidence that it would endanger a special-needs child who was at risk for suicide to be put in the custody of a parent who was thought to have created some of those needs, and who was thought to lack the ability to adequately care for those needs. The child's psychotherapist stated that the child had post traumatic stress disorder and that the child's anxiety varied directly with the extent of the child's contact with the father. The child's psychological evaluation stated that a sudden move to live with the father would be deeply traumatic. The custody evaluation stated both that the child was already planning on how to leave the father should the decision be made for the child to live with the father and that the child would best be served remaining in the sister's custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant installed an automatic changeable sign outside his business. Defendant was cited for displaying the message &quot;walk in for better health,&quot; accompanied by flickering snowflakes, and later for displaying a waving American flag; defendant was also issued additional citations thereafter. Defendant argued that the city code prohibiting the use of motion signs was facially unconstitutional. The appellate court ruled that the city code was a valid time, place, or manner regulation. The city code only prohibited the manner in which signs could operate and did not prevent use of signs as a means of communication. Any message could be displayed as long as the sign did not revolve, rotate, use moving parts, or give the illusion of motion. The City determined that its legitimate goal of preventing traffic accidents would be served less effectively if motion signs were not prohibited, and the appellate court observed no reason to conclude such a common-sense determination was unreasonable. As the prohibition against motion signs applied throughout the City, a special use permit for an automatic changeable sign did not excuse defendant from the prohibition against motion signs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a commercial airline pilot, and his wife separated. He changed his residency to Alaska, but he continued to live in the family home in Minnesota. Defendant, in his dissolution petition, indicated that he resided in Minnesota. Later, defendant bought a townhouse in Minnesota. On appeal, defendant argued that the rule governing whether a person was domiciled in the state for income-tax purposes was too ill-defined. The appellate court disagreed. The fact that taxpayers were required to rely on common sense did not render the law unconstitutionally vague on its face. Defendant also argued that the rule was vague as applied to him. The number of days he spent in Minnesota, and his actions concerning his house and townhouse, confirmed his intention to make Minnesota his home. Defendant also claimed that the district court committed prejudicial error by refusing to instruct the jury that they had to agree unanimously on which theory of residency the state had proved. The appellate court disagreed. Finally, defendant claimed that the trial court erred by admitting a rule into evidence without redacting it. Any error, however, in admitting the rule was harmless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, found defendant guilty of failing to register as a sex offender pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166 (2000). Defendant appealed, asserting the statute violated the separation-of-powers doctrine. He also argued that, because he was homeless when he was charged with failing to register as a predatory offender, the registration requirement could not be applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had acknowledged his duty to register as a sex offender and agreed to register all changes of address at least five days prior to changing residences. In 2002, he was evicted, but he failed to inform the proper authorities of the eviction and of his new location. Thus, the instant charges were brought. The appellate court held that because the requirement to register as a predatory offender was not part of a defendant's sentence, and was imposed under a civil regulatory scheme, the separation-of-powers doctrine was not implicated. However, the Minnesota Supreme Court had recently held that the registration requirement in Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166 (2000) did not apply to homeless offenders who did not live somewhere where mail could be received and were unable to provide five days' notice of where they would be staying. A bald assertion that one was homeless would not necessarily preclude application of the statute. However, because the record did not indicate the degree of defendant's homelessness, specifically, whether he was living somewhere where he could receive mail, and whether he could provide five days' notice that he was staying there, a remand was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was remanded for a determination of whether defendant's living situation met the statutory requirements that he was able to receive mail and give five days' notice of intent to stay there. If his living situation did not meet those requirements, the district court was to vacate his conviction of failure to register as a predatory sex offender.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The base rate statistics such as those at issue in the psychological and actuarial tests were a factor that courts should use in determining whether a person should be committed as an SPP or SDP. Therefore, the trial court was obligated to consider the psychological and actuarial tests in its decision and any question of their reliability would only affect the weight that the trial court afforded them and not their admissibility. Because the reliability of the psychological and actuarial tests was sufficiently established in the hearing and the district court was obligated to consider the results of the psychological and actuarial tests in its decision, the patient was not prejudiced by the fact that the burden of proving the reliability of the psychological and actuarial tests was shifted to him.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, asserting the officer lacked reasonable, articulable suspicion to justify an investigatory stop, and performed a custodial interrogation without providing a Miranda warning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record established that a convenience store employee called the police department and made a conclusory report that &quot;her manager&quot; saw two men in a car &quot;looking like they were cutting something illegal.&quot; The officer, not having observed any criminal activity himself, arrived on the scene, immediately drew his gun, and ordered defendant to show his hands. The officer then performed a pat down search and threatened to call a canine unit if defendant did not &quot;speed the process up&quot; by telling him the location of the contraband. Defendant then admitted there was a &quot;pipe&quot; in the car. A further search revealed a small rock of methamphetamine. When an investigative stop was not based on the officer's observations, the informant's tip had to provide at least some specific and articulable facts to support the bare allegation of criminal activity. The appellate court held the employee's statement, which actually came from the employee's manager, satisfied that criteria. The appellate court held that because the officer put his gun back in its holster before questioning defendant, and because defendant was not handcuffed, defendant was not in custody and no Miranda warning was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order, denying defendant's motion to suppress, and defendant's conviction, were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that because the loan officer violated the Minnesota Residential Originator and Servicer Licensing Act (Act), Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 58.01-58.17 (2000), the department had jurisdiction over the loan officer, even though he was exempt from the Act's licensure requirement. Further, the department's order barring him from engaging in mortgage origination and servicing did not unconstitutionally infringe upon the loan officer's property interest in pursuing private employment. The department's actions in the proceedings did not prejudice him because any potential prejudice was remedied by a continuance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim met in a bar, exchanged business cards, and then went to two other bars together.

The victim escaped from the car, and defendant ran after her and tackled her to the ground, and tore open her blouse. Defendant left the victim when she threw up. The victim sustained an abrasion on her chin, complained of head pain, and had red marks on her chest and breast. The appellate court held the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of second-degree criminal assault as the victim's injuries were sufficient to establish personal injury under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.343, subd. 1(e)(i) (2002). The court also upheld the 66 month sentence imposed as it was consistent or less severe than convictions with similar injuries to the victim, and the district court articulated compelling circumstances warranting a downward departure consistent with the mitigating factors set forth in the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

On March 18, the school board adopted the recommendation to expel the student for 12 months. The student claimed that the 29-day delay between the fight and the start of the expulsion proceedings violated procedural due process rights. The appellate court held that, given that the delay in the expulsion proceedings was due to the initial statement that the student would proceed with an agreement in lieu of expulsion, the student's due process rights were not violated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court determined that the officer did not need to articulate a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in order to stop defendant for the purpose of issuing a ticket for failure to yield to an emergency vehicle.

The appellate court determined that the officer essentially created the emergency by attempting to stop defendant. The appellate court ruled that under the circumstances, the officer was required to articulate a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Defendant also argued that the district court erred in excluding testimony of an officer that defendant intended to call as an expert witness. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not abuse its broad discretion in determining the officer's anticipated testimony was irrelevant.

The officer never testified that he was mistaken or that no white light was actually emitting from the taillight, despite his observation of the old and faded tape on the taillight cover. Furthermore, concerning defendant's argument that he did not validly consent to a Lothenbach trial, the appellate court ruled that defendant's agreement was sufficiently personal, explicit, and in accordance with Minn. R. Crim. P. 26.01 to constitute valid consent to a Lothenbach trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner motorist was arrested for third-degree driving while impaired (DWI). His driving privileges were revoked by respondent, the Minnesota Commissioner of Public Safety, pursuant to the Minnesota Implied Consent Law, specifically Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.52, subd. 4 (2002). The Scott County District Court, Minnesota, upheld the Commissioner's decision, and the motorist appealed, asserting he was not in physical control of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trooper responded to the motorist's stalled car. After calling for a tow truck, the trooper found open beer bottles in the car. About the same time, the motorist came walking up with a gas can. The car still would not start, so the trooper asked the motorist to sit in the squad car until the tow truck arrived. The trooper then smelled alcohol on the motorist. A preliminary breath test revealed that the motorist had a blood alcohol content of .118. The Minnesota Implied Consent Law, specifically Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.52, subd. 4 (2002), provided that the Commissioner had a duty to revoke a motorist's license if the motorist was in physical control of a motor vehicle, and had a alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more. The appellate court noted the legislature intended the implied consent statute was to be given the &quot;broadest possible effect.&quot; Physical control did not only mean being behind the wheel or actually driving, but applied where one had the potential to take control and present a traffic hazard. The appellate court held the motorist was in physical control and rejected the motorist's argument that he was unlawfully seized by the trooper's request that he wait in the patrol car.</SPAN></P>

However, the appellate court ruled that, because the father offered no evidence that he had sustained, or was in danger of sustaining, a direct injury, he did not demonstrate that he had standing to make a constitutional challenge. Also, the appellate court ruled that there was no abuse of discretion in awarding the mother attorney fees, Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.14, subd. 1, when the district court concluded that the father had unreasonably added to the length and expense of the case by failing to comply with the parties' stipulated agreement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress on the stop issue and his Terry-frisk argument, deciding that the officers had articulable grounds to frisk defendant by feeling the apparent bulge in his pants pocket. Defendant argued that the officer lacked probable cause to reach into his pants after either seeing or feeling a bulge in his pocket. The appellate court noted that for the first time on appeal, defendant raised arguments regarding the seizure of his firearm that went beyond the topics of the police stop and the occurrence of a frisk. Defendant argued that the officer's frisk of the bulge in his pants pocket was actually a search, lacking in probable cause, because the officer reached inside defendant's pants pocket before feeling the weapon in a pat-down search. Defendant neither made this factual contention nor argued any probable-cause-for-search issue in the trial court. By failing to raise an issue below, he waived the argument on appeal. Defendant also disregarded the trial court's finding that the searching officer felt the bulge and thereby immediately identified it as a gun, and this occurred before the officer acted further to remove defendant.</SPAN></P>

The fact that the officer began an &quot;inventory&quot; search seemed indisputable on the record. He had a duty to impound the car, and he did so. He had a duty to perform an inventory search of the impounded vehicle. He filled out the first part of the inventory form. He started the search that he was duty-bound to perform. If the search became principally investigative thereafter, the inventory-basis was not nullified. Thus, the instant court answered the Holmes test question in the affirmative, that is, the inventory search would have happened no matter what police discovered because it was mandatory under police department standards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, his two minor children, his girlfriend, and another adult were all staying at a cabin. Another couple was in the process of buying the cabin, and they were not aware defendant and his friends had made arrangements to stay on the property. Law enforcement was called. The officers noticed marijuana plants in plain view. Inside a pair of pants, marijuana was found, as well as a needle, and a syringe with red liquid. The warrantless search of defendant's pockets exceeded an acceptable search conducted with consent and was unconstitutional, unless an exception applied. The officers had probable cause to arrest all adult occupants. That entitled them to conduct a search incident to arrest. Moreover, the search of the pants was within the scope of searches incident to a lawful arrest. The link to defendant was established when defendant later admitted that the pants were his. The jury correctly weighed the evidence, and it found that defendant was in exclusive control of the pants. The State proved constructive possession. Finally, the state agreed that defendant should not have been sentenced for both possession of a controlled substance and child endangerment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In July 2002, the driver was arrested in Wisconsin for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI).

Stat. &sect;&sect; 624.714, 609.66, subd. 1d (Supp. 2003) as applied to church parking lots, employees, and leased areas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenged law, which provided that citizens could obtain permits to carry concealed weapons, restricted the right of property owners to ban weapons from their property. The church challenged the constitutionality of the act, as applied to church property, and sought a declaration that the church did not have to allow the possession of firearms on church property, including parking lots and leased premises. The lower court found that the church had no standing because there was no justiciable controversy. The court, in reversing, concluded that although the statute lacked an enforcement provision, the church was in direct conflict with Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.714, subds. 17(c), (e), 18(c) because it had posted signs prohibiting the possession of firearms in its parking areas and leased areas. The issue of whether the statute infringed on the church's right to control its property presented a justiciable controversy. Moreover, the church raised an arguable free exercise of religion claim under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The trial court's failure to provide sufficient factual findings when determining whether a temporary injunction should be granted was also in error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued, inter alia, that the written motion to suppress was not specific enough to put it on notice of defendant's suppression claims and that it was prejudiced by the lack of notice of the claims. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant's omnibus motion advised that he wished to challenge all evidence obtained by searches and seizures on the ground that the evidence was obtained in violation of his constitutional or statutory rights. Most of the evidence used to convict defendant was obtained through the execution of search warrants subsequent to the pat-down search in the motel parking lot. Imprecise as it was, the motion was sufficient to give notice to the State that defendant wished to challenge the admission of the evidence obtained in those searches. Additionally, the record did not support the trial court's conclusion that defendant waived all suppression claims other than his claim for the suppression of the drugs found in the pat-down search and his comments. In the letter to the trial court, the State offered to stipulate that it would not introduce in its case-in-chief the drugs found during the pat-down search any statements regarding the drugs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by committing him because it made no findings on whether defendant had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. The court of appeals disagreed. Three of the eight complaints against defendant those that resulted in convictions for sex-related offenses. There was ample credible evidence to support the trial court's findings that defendant committed acts of harmful sexual conduct upon two other victims. Although defendant was never prosecuted for a 1979 incident, the record supported the trial court's finding that defendant's actions amounted to harmful sexual conduct. In describing the incident, defendant stated that he was &quot;unable to account for his own behavior,&quot; that &quot;something snapped&quot; inside of him, that he &quot;lost it,&quot; and that he had a sex problem. The trial court relied on that evidence and the expert testimony to support its decision that defendant was a sexually dangerous person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a state tax case, the parties brought cross-motions for summary judgment asking the tax court to determine whether appellant corporation was entitled to claim a dividend received deduction under Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.21, subd. 4, for dividends deemed to have been paid by its subsidiary for the tax years in issue. Appellee was the Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no dispute that the subsidiary was a foreign sales corporation (FSC). The issue was whether the corporation was entitled to the deduction for dividends received from the subsidiary. The Commissioner argued that the corporation was not entitled to the deduction as a matter of law because the subsidiary was an FSC. The corporation argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.21, subd. 4(e) denied the dividend received deduction only when the dividends were actually paid, rather than deemed to be paid, and for dividends paid by non-unitary FSCs, not a unitary FSC like the subsidiary. The tax court concluded that the corporation was not entitled to claim the dividend received deduction for the tax years in issue because Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.21, subd. 4(e) clearly stated that the dividend received deduction did not apply if the dividends were paid by an FSC, without distinguishing between unitary and non-unitary FSCs. Also, the statute made no distinction between deemed and actual dividends. In addition, denying the dividend received deduction to foreign operating corporations (FOCs) that were FSCs did not afford different treatment on its face or based upon where the FOC was incorporated.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 297A.01, subd. 16(a) (2000). Rather, telecommunications resulting from the purchase of the equipment constituted an intangible service. The taxpayer did not point to any new technical information that distinguished its case from recent decisions. The equipment was also not purchased to be sold ultimately at retail under Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.25 subd. 42 (2000). The court disagreed that the manufactured product was the physical telecommunications network, composed of the equipment, that was leased to the paying customers. The taxpayer sold access, not machinery or equipment, to its customers, and the purchases were not purchases for resale. The distinction between manufacturers of tangible personal property and telecommunications providers did not violate the Uniformity Clause, Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court determined that the 1995 letter did not bear the signature or facsimile signature of the commissioner or his delegate. It did not mention the banks' right to appeal to the tax court. Furthermore, it did not state that it was an order, notice or determination of the commissioner, nor did it state that a final decision had been made. Because the statutory signature requirement has not been met, the 1995 letter was not and never was an order.

The commissioner prepared tax returns for the years at issue on the taxpayer's behalf and assessed the taxpayer additional income tax, penalties, and interest as a result. The taxpayer commenced an administrative appeal, and the commissioner affirmed his earlier decision. On appeal, the taxpayer contended that his state taxable income was zero. Appellant's sole argument was that the federal income tax, and hence the state tax law derived from it, was unconstitutional, and not applicable to a United States citizen, because the tax was not apportioned according to the federal census. The court found that the cases cited by the taxpayer in support of his argument were decided prior to adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or otherwise did not support the taxpayer's position.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A parking lot was owned by the city, leased to petitioner parking company, and operated as public parking and the city's farmers market. The property was listed as exempt for taxes payable for some of the time the lease was in operation. Respondent county sent the company a notice of tax lien for personal property taxes payable for 1995 through 1999. The Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) ordered the parties to proceed to Tax Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case at bar concerned whether the subject property was exempt from property taxes due pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 272.01, subd. 2(b)(1), and the effect of failure to receive notice of taxes assessed. The case came before the tax court on the county's motion to dismiss and the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. The tax court held that although it did not dismiss the petition in its entirety, for failure to state a claim, it dismissed the years 1995-1999 from the petition, as a petition under Minn. Stat. Ch. 278 could not address more than one assessment year. However, it allowed the parking company to re-file separate petitions for those years as the county had failed to give the company proper notice by sending the assessments to an incorrect address. The tax court also found that, although the subject property was exempt as a municipal parking facility under Minn. Stat. &sect; 270.01, it was not exempt under Minn. Stat. &sect; 459.14. Section 459.14 required that a lease prohibited the sale of any merchandise or supplies on the property. The lease in question specifically recognized that the property would be run, in part, as a farmers market, thus, it was not exempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parking company's motion for partial summary judgment was granted and the county's motion for summary judgment was denied. The remaining issues were set for trial.</SPAN></P>

Also, the company and the affiliate were not of mutual benefit, dependent upon, or contributory to each other. The changes to the relevant statutes since a prior decision did not invalidate that finding. Because the company and the affiliate were separate businesses, and because the affiliate had no nexus to Minnesota, its income was neither able to be combined with that of the company, nor did Minnesota have jurisdiction to tax the affiliate separately. Therefore, the commissioner erred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation owned by the consultant entered into a sham employment arrangement with a taxpayer to hamper the ability of the commissioner of revenue to collect taxes owed by the taxpayer. The corporation failed to comply with a proper wage levy against the taxpayer. The tax court held that the consultant was personally liable for the corporation's failure to comply with the wage levy. The issue on remand was whether the commissioner of revenue's assessment under Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.92, subd. 23 (1994), violated the Excessive Fine Clauses of the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. The tax court found that: (1) Minn. Stat. &sect; 290.92, subd. 23 (1994), was remedial in nature when examined against the Kennedy test; (2) even if arguendo punitive, the levy statute was not excessive because it roughly approximated the taxes due plus the costs of collection; and (3) the assessment was not disproportionately harsh, nor was it so divorced from the reality of what the government suffered in damages and expenses as to constitute punishment.</SPAN></P>

Indeed, no such instructions were given for several years after the taxable year in which the contribution was made. Furthermore, the fund had no legal duty to carry out instructions of the donor. Therefore, in the taxable year of the contribution, there was no way to tell if the contribution would have ultimately benefited a Minnesota charity. Therefore, the commissioner did not err in disallowing the deductions.</SPAN></P>

On the wife's state income tax return, she claimed both daughters as dependents. Appellee Commissioner of Revenue for Minnesota ordered a reduction in the amount of the wife's claim under the Minnesota Property Tax Refund Act. The wife appealed, and both parties moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the issue was whether the wife could claim both of her daughters as dependents for purposes of the Minnesota Property Tax Refund. The wife also claimed that the Commissioner's application of the law was a violation of her constitutional right to equal protection and uniformity of taxation. The state tax court found that one of the minor children was a dependent of the husband for the tax year 1997 and not a dependent of the wife for Minnesota property tax refund purposes. In addition, the tax court did not find that the Commissioner singled out the wife or treated her differently than other taxpayers in her situation. Further, the Commissioner's interpretation of the relevant statutes was not a violation of the wife's constitutional guarantees of equal protection and uniformity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the commissioner erred in denying its refund because: (1) it was a mutual and property casualty company and should be taxed at a rate of 1.26 percent; and (2) Minn.

The tax court held that the commissioner did not err because: (1) the company was not a mutual property and casualty company within the meaning of &sect; 60A.15. because the plain meaning of the term mutual property and casualty company signified a company that sold property insurance, the company did not sell property insurance, so, therefore, it could not be a property and casualty company; and (2) the class of companies eligible for a lower rate in Minn. Stat. &sect; 60A.15, subd. 1(e) were town and farmers' mutual insurance companies and mutual property and casualty companies and the proceeds of the premium taxes on the companies in that class went for the funding of rural police and fire relief programs, therefore, Minn.

They failed to establish a lack of a reasonable basis for the statute. They provided no evidence the legislature could not have reasonably determined that market value of property gave some indication of the ability to pay and accordingly decided to tax homesteads to reflect market value. They also failed to establish that the legislature's purpose was not legitimate as well as failing to show the two-tier tax system violated the equal protection doctrine. Finally, they failed to meet their burden of proof because they did not offer any evidence or argument regarding relevance or connection between the purpose of the law, the needs peculiar to the class, and the prescribed remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a pipeline transmission company that shipped natural gas, used 3 percent of the gas it shipped to run its compressor engines, located at intervals along its pipeline and used to maintain gas pressure and to remove impurities from the gas. The shippers allowed appellant to use this gas without charge. Appellant sought a refund of the use taxes it paid on the gas burned in its compressors, arguing that its use of the gas was not a taxable event. Appellee, the Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue, denied a refund, and appellant sought review. The court held that appellee &quot;used&quot; the gas in Minnesota; and that while it paid no money for the gas, it &quot;purchased&quot; it because the right to use it was part of the consideration it received for shipping the gas. Therefore, the use of the gas was taxable under Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A. 14, subd. 1. However, since the gas was used in industrial production of an item - natural gas - to be sold ultimately at retail, it was exempt from the use tax under Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.25, subd. 9. The appellee's order was reversed, and appellant was granted a full refund of the use tax paid on compressor gas.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged the constitutionality, under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, of Minn. Stat. &sect; 273.13, subd. 24(a), otherwise known as the Contiguous Property Exception, which created tiers of values for tax purposes. Practical difficulty alone furnished a basis for this classification. Varying treatment of different groups or persons was not a constitutional defect. Simply because a statute produced unequal results in some cases did not render it unconstitutional. Seeking to prevent commercial property owners from subdividing their properties to receive the preferred rate on multiple portions was a legitimate purpose. A discriminatory purpose was not presumed. Petitioner failed to show clear and intentional discrimination. The court denied petitioner's motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of the respondent county.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2 (2014), did not violate the Fourth Amendment as applied because officers with probable cause arrested defendant and read the implied-consent advisory, and, after speaking with an attorney, defendant refused to provide a breath sample.</SPAN></P>

The city initiated one cause of action, which culminated in the administrative citation that the owner did not appeal; [3]-Dismissal of the related criminal charge did not preclude the city from considering the underlying facts in the license-application proceeding; [4]-Because the administrative-citation proceeding was fully and finally adjudicated, the city did not err by considering evidence that the owner violated the regulation prohibiting nudity and sexual contact with patrons in the licensing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 253B.001- 253B.24, was the exclusive remedy for patients committed as SDPs and SPPs seeking a transfer or discharge; [2]-The principle of comity was a valid reason for the district court to refrain from addressing the constitutionality of the Minnesota Sex Offender Program on a motion filed pursuant to Minn. R. Civ. P. 60.02; [3]-The district court did not err by ruling on appellant's motion before the time allowed for a reply memorandum, because the county did not raise new legal or factual matters in its responsive memorandum.</SPAN></P>
