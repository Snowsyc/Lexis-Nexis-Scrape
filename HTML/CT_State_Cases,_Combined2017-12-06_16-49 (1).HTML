</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee sued defendant employer for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, wrongful discharge, breach of implied covenant of good faith, unjust enrichment, sexual harassment, religious discrimination and invasion of privacy. The employer moved to strike several of those counts for failure to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A store supervisor and manager spoke &quot;badly&quot; about the employee to other employees, mocked her because she lacked fluency in English and denied her use of the bathroom on several occasions, on one occasion when the employee explained that she was undergoing her menstrual cycle. Shortly after that incident, the employee was removed from the work schedule. She initially did not receive any explanation. She was subsequently informed that she was terminated because her religious obligations were in conflict with the employer's needs. The court held that requiring the employee to beg for a bathroom key to the point where she bled through her clothing could lead an average member of the community to exclaim, &quot;Outrageous.&quot; Making her wait over 48 hours before telling her that she was fired&quot; was sufficiently wrongful and therefore, satisfied the pleading requirements for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-60(a)(8) made clear, without allegations of any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature, the employer could not have committed sexual harassment, as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers motion to strike was denied as to the counts for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance company brought an action against defendant widow, seeking a declaration that 2005 Conn. Acts 230 &sect; 2 was unconstitutional. Defendant law firm intervened. The insurance company moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company argued, inter alia, that 2005 Conn. Acts 230 &sect; 2, which allowed the widow to apply for workers' compensation survivor's benefits, was unconstitutional as a public emolument. The court agreed. Legislation seeking to remedy a procedural default for which the state was not responsible did not serve a public purpose and ran afoul of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. It was clear that 2005 Conn. Acts 230 &sect; 2 was designed to benefit the widow individually, even though it did not mention her by name. The class of persons benefitted were those dependents of a deceased employee seeking compensation arising out of the death of the deceased employee, whose date of injury was between June 1, 1991 and June 30, 1991 and whose death was between November 1, 1992 and November 30, 1992. This was indeed a thinly constricted category. The insurance company provided sufficient evidence to support its assertion that 2005 Conn. Acts 230 &sect; 2 was narrowly drawn and passed to provide a benefit to only a single person, the widow. It was highly unlikely that another individual would have benefitted. Cases cited by the widow in opposition benefitted classes of persons, not individuals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sexual assault in the second degree, risk of injury to a minor and delivery of alcohol to a minor. A jury failed to delivery a unanimous verdict and a mistrial was declared. Defendant moved to dismiss the information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of his motion, defendant argued that the State will not produce new evidence and, therefore, the information should be dismissed for insufficient evidence. The court disagreed, finding that defendant did not conclusively establish that the court had before it all the State's evidence. The court also found no overriding equitable considerations necessitating a dismissal of the information under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-56. Defendant also argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21 was void for vagueness as applied to the circumstances of the case. The court disagreed, finding that &sect; 53-21 required the State to establish that defendant had a general intent to engage in the proscribed act that resulted in the sexual assault of the victim. The court also found that a person of ordinary intelligence would know that sexual intercourse was likely to impair the morals of a minor child and thus, &sect; 53-21 was not void for vagueness on the &quot;morals&quot; provision. The court noted that defendant made no plausible argument that he acted in reliance on the belief that his conduct was lawful or that a person of ordinary intelligence would have no reason to know he was engaging in prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of capital felony, and the State sought a death sentence. Defendant provided notice that, during the penalty phase hearing, he intended to offer evidence in the nature of expert psychiatric testimony by certain mental health professionals. The State filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude such evidence. The State also requested that the court conduct a Porter hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wished to present the evidence at issue for the purpose of establishing a statutory mitigating factor pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-46a(h)(3). The State sought to preclude such evidence as, inter alia, unreliable. The court found, however, that the plain language of &sect; 53a-46a(c) drew a clear distinction between mitigation evidence and aggravation evidence offered in a capital felony penalty phase hearing. Mitigation evidence needed only to have been relevant in order to have been admissible, whereas aggravation evidence needed to have comported with the rules which governed the admission of evidence in criminal trials. On its face, the language of the statute authorized a judge presiding over a penalty hearing to exclude mitigating evidence only on the basis of a lack of relevancy. The Supreme Court of Connecticut had declined to read into the statute a foundational requirement of reliability for admissibility of mitigating evidence at a capital felony phase hearing. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-46a(c) should have been applied as written, and was not unconstitutional in allowing the State to rebut mitigation evidence under a &quot;relevancy only&quot; standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus seeking to challenge a determination of the Connecticut Board of Pardons and Paroles that he committed a parole violation and the resulting revocation of his parole. Respondent warden moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The habeas court held that any due process violations that might have occurred pertaining to a 2005 remand to custody and parole violation were supplanted by the inmate's release to parole on May 14, 2007 and the ensuing parole violations in December 2007. The December 2007 parole violations resulted in an April 2008 conviction. The inmate was not confined due to any due process violations that might have occurred between 2005 and 2007. The claim of fabricated reasons for the 2005 parole revocation failed to state a claim and was moot. The Board appeared to not have adhered to time frames specified by state regulations. However, these failures did not render the inmate's confinement illegal. The Board had several bases for revoking the inmate's parole. The delays in ultimately arriving at the parole revocation determination did not weaken, undermine, or render unlawful the parole revocation itself as based on the inmate's violations of the conditions of his release to parole. The due process claim failed to state a claim upon which habeas corpus relief could be granted and was moot. The petition was dismissed under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 23-29(3) and (4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss the petition in its entirety was granted. Judgment was entered dismissing the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

While DCF made reasonable efforts as to the mother and the mother complied with some of the steps ordered, the mother did not maintain suitable employment, was discharged from a supportive housing program, missed scheduled visitations, continued involvement with the criminal system, and did not follow through with counseling.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife filed an action for dissolution of marriage against defendant husband. The husband moved for DNA testing of the four children born during the marriage. The motion was granted and the youngest child was found not to be the husband's biological child. Before the court was the husband's motion for access with the youngest child. The youngest child's biological father was added as a party to the instant action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a deposition, the wife admitted having sexual relations with another man during the parties' marriage, prompting the husband's request for DNA testing. The youngest child, who was five years and three months old at the time of trial, believed that the husband was her father until she was there years and nine months old. Following the results of the DNA testing, the wife and the biological father refused to allow the child to visit with the husband. The child was made aware that the biological father was her father, not the husband. The court concluded that it would be in the child's best interest to have visitation with the husband. The court found that the sudden and total removal of the husband from the child's life, without a substantially valid reason, exposed the child to psychological harm. While the bond between the child and the husband diminished during the year the husband was not permitted access to the child, the child and the husband had a strong and appropriate parent-child attachment before that time. In addition, the court credited the guardian ad litem's testimony that the child wanted to visit the husband when her brothers visited him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband's motion for access was granted. The wife's motion to dismiss was denied. An evaluation of the child was ordered prior to the court entering a permanent visitation schedule for the husband.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner filed suit against defendant town, alleging inverse condemnation and seeking a judgment that its land be recognized not as a subdivision but as two adjacent lots and that zoning and building permits be issued for the same. The town filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the inverse condemnation claim did not meet the final decision requirement and that the declaratory judgment claim was not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner alleged that town official approved the dividing of the property into four lot, but the town refused to allow the development of the property and required subdivision approval. The owner contended that applying for zoning permits would be futile. The superior court held that the actions of the town did not amount to a confiscation of the owner's property. A final decision on the owner's plan had not been rendered. The owner's unsupported allegations were insufficient to show that applying for subdivision approval would have been futile. The complaint was devoid of any specifics as to how the town's actions rendered the property unusable for any practical purpose or resulted in the deprivation of value to the land. The superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment matter because the owner failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. It neither filed an application for subdivision approval, nor an application for zoning permits. Although the owner claimed that any action would have been futile, it failed to claim that the town would not hear its argument, review its application, or not be able to provide the relief requested.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-112(j)(3)(B). The children had been previously adjudicated as neglected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had a lengthy history of alcohol abuse and violence. After an episode of physical violence between the parents, wherein the police were called, the children were adjudicated as neglected and their temporary custody was granted to DCF. Specific steps were issued to each parent to facilitate possible reunification. Thereafter, DCF sought TPR pursuant to &sect; 17a-112(j)(3)(B). The court found that reasonable efforts to reunify the children with their parents were not successful because the parents had not completed their specific steps in a timely manner pursuant to &sect; 17a-112(j)(3)(B) and Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 35a-7A. Both parents minimized their problems and failed to obtain treatment for them, the mother was not consistent in her attempts at rehabilitation, and the father did not believe that he had any problems. Services were offered to each parent and to the children, and it was determined that reasonable efforts by DCF were made with respect to the mother. Such efforts were not required as to the father under &sect; 17a-112(j). Noting that the children were in stable non-relative foster placements, the court found that TPR was in the children's best interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted DCF's petition and terminated the parental rights of the mother and father. DCF was appointed as the statutory parent of the children.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent father moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction applicant maternal grandmother's application for visitation with the father's five-year-old child under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 46b-56 and -57, and the appointment of a guardian ad litem to represent the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's mother and the father shared joint legal custody, and exercised a shared parenting arrangement. The mother died. The trial court held that the grandmother did not plead sufficient facts to establish a parent-like relationship and that denial of visitation would cause harm to the child analogous to the harm contemplated in the abuse and neglect statutes, namely Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 46b-120 and -129. The application set forth an apparently delightful relationship between the grandmother and the child, but it did not meet the parent-like standard. Furthermore, there were no facts alleged that could be construed to meet the harm requirement. The trial court considered only the pleadings and did not consider the factual submissions proffered by the father's or the grandmother's affidavits. However, even if all of the affidavit entries had been included in the grandmother's initial pleadings, the Roth requirements were not met. The law had recognized the fundamental parental rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and had fashioned a method to preserve those rights, recognizing the enormous responsibilities and concomitant privileges of parenthood.</SPAN></P>

Pub. Acts 09-01, which the distributors alleged violated the 5th and 14th Amendments of the United States Constitution and Conn. Const. art 1, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The distributors opened and funded special accounts in the State. 2009 Conn. Pub. Acts 09-01 required them to pay revenue generated from beverage container deposits to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. The distributors asserted a vested property interest in the money they deposited in the accounts and sought to enjoin defendants from requiring them to pay, arguing that the payment constituted an unconstitutional taking of their property. The superior court held that the distributors had an adequate remedy at law and would not suffer irreparable harm if the temporary injunction was not granted. Any damages the distributors could suffer were reducible to monetary compensation. The distributors could seek to recover the amounts at issue by refusing to pay and defending against the attorney general's suit to recover the payments or by paying the amounts and seeking to recover them as just compensation. If the distributors paid the money to the State and were found to have had a vested interest in the money, they could be made whole with money damages. The equities favored the State because it was facing a massive financial crisis involving huge budget deficits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three people were residing in a house when bullets entered the house through the windows and the walls. A woman living next door to the victims' house observed a small fire burning on the side of the victims' house. Two other men saw two or three unidentified men near the victims' house and called the police. The unidentified men ran to a black Pontiac Grand Am car. After a car chase, the police eventually identified the prisoner as one of the occupants of the car. According to the prisoner, the State did not disclose the foregoing information regarding a witness's sentence modifications. The court concluded that the prisoner failed to show that the evidence allegedly suppressed was favorable to him, either because it was exculpatory or impeaching. There was no evidence that the State had an agreement with the witness and that he would derive some benefit in exchange for his testimony. The prisoner failed to show any specific instances that indicated there was such impairment or compromise of his interest for the benefit of another party. Thus, the prisoner failed to demonstrate that his attorney was operating under an actual or potential conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court held that the claims commissioner concluded that the claim accrued only when the harm was discovered by way of an expert opinion. This finding of fact satisfied the timeliness provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148(a). There had been no constitutional challenge with regard to the claims commissioner's decision as to the accrual date. The Connecticut general assembly had not passed a special act allowing the patient to sue the State, for which the Public Emoluments Clause, Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, would have allowed review. The reviewing court lacked jurisdiction to hear appeals from the claims commissioner because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-164a expressly exempted the claims commissioner from the operation of the Connecticut Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183, the provision of that permitted an appeal to the reviewing court. The State sought to accomplish such an appeal in its motion to dismiss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner filed two separate lawsuits relating to sewer assessments for new sewers built in his area of town. The first case, in which he was not the named plaintiff, was an appeal by property owners from the levy of sewer assessments. The second case, in which he was the named plaintiff, involved the filing of a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that certification of the sewer construction costs should not have occurred. The filing in both cases was based on Greenwich, Conn., Municipal Code &sect; 259(a) allowing aggrieved parties to appeal assessments to the trial court. The town and town condemnation commission sought dismissal of the declaratory judgment action. The trial court found dismissal unwarranted because (1) the appeal of the assessment was permitted pursuant to Greenwich, Conn., Municipal Code &sect; 259(a); (2) he could use a separate declaratory judgment to appeal despite the similar issue being considered in the first case; and (3) Conn. Gen.

Stat. &sect; 19a-642, plaintiff office of health care access (OHCA) sued defendant provider to enforce the certificate of need (CON) process to operate imaging equipment. The provider alleged special defenses under U.S. Const. amend. V and Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11; and that 2006 Conn. Pub. Acts 06-28 (the Act) was unconstitutional. The OHCA moved to strike the provider's special defenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The OHCA sought a permanent injunction, barring the use of the equipment until the provider complied with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-639. The trial referee found that the provider did not allege facts to support the defense that an injunction would be an unconstitutional taking. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-639a(c) was regulatory. The broad application of &sect; 19a-639a(c) to health care entities eliminated the possibility that the provider was unfairly singled out or deprived of economic use of its property in a way that implicated the takings clause of the federal or state constitution. The as-applied challenge failed for the same reason. The Act did not qualify as a bill of attainder; it did not impose punishment without a judicial trial, and it was not a historically recognized form of legislative punishment. No facts were alleged suggesting that the Act was penal in nature and therefore an ex post facto law, or that the Act was a validating act due to the OHCA's unlawful taking of the imaging equipment through legislative action. U.S. Const. amend. V's due process clause did not apply to the States. Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 19a-643-17 did not provide for discrimination claims.</SPAN></P>

The court found that DCF made reasonable efforts to achieve each of the plans under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-111b(a). Thereafter, DCF sought TPR. The mother was absent from Connecticut for a period of time, failed to visit or maintain contact, and had endured domestic violence from the father. Both parents had substance abuse issues and had failed to financially support the children. There was clear and convincing evidence that DCF offered services to the parents and made reasonable efforts towards reunification. The evidence supported the grounds for termination under &sect; 17a-112(j)(3)(B), (A), and (D), and that the best interests of the children were served by termination.

The mother had pervasive psychological problems that impeded the mother's ability to effectively parent the children, the mother's home was unsafe, and the mother did not cooperate with therapy for the children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, who shot and killed his estranged wife, alleged (1) that the trial court's plea canvass was deficient, rendering the inmate's pleas not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary; and (2) that he received ineffective assistance of his trial counsel in that counsel failed to file a motion to suppress the inmate's statement to the police, failed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the crime, and failed to apprise the inmate adequately of the advantages and disadvantages of going to trial. The court found that the majority of the inmate's claims could be decided on the unequivocal testimony of the inmate that he would not have proceeded to trial even if he knew he was going to be sentenced to the 25 years he ultimately received. He could not, therefore, hope to demonstrate prejudice resulting from his counsel's ineffective assistance because he could not prove that but for counsel's errors, the inmate would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. Furthermore, the inmate's claim that the plea canvass was inadequate was procedurally defaulted.

V and Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. The company moved for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' properties were encumbered by a utility transmission easement granted to the company. The easement had been included in an electric infrastructure project. As part of this project, the company performed work on the property encumbered by the easement. The owners contended that their use of their property had been harmed by the company's excessive use of the easement, including the cutting of trees and the construction of &quot;offensive&quot; towers and poles. They also claimed that the negative perceptions and stigma associated with newly installed high voltage power lines diminished the value of their properties. The company argued that the owners' inverse condemnation counts failed because the owners did not assert a constitutional taking. The superior court agreed, holding that the owners' allegations were insufficient to amount to a &quot;taking&quot; of their property in a constitutional sense. The owners did not allege or offer any evidence indicating that their use or enjoyment of their property had been abridged or destroyed to a substantial or sufficient degree to be confiscatory. The facts involved an alleged excessive or burdensome use of an existing easement.</SPAN></P>

Those regulations listed hazardous chemicals but did not include phosphorus. Thus, defendants claimed that phosphorus was not within the regulatory scheme and its use was therefore not unreasonable. The court found, however, that the absence of a comprehensive legislative and regulatory scheme did not mean an action under &sect; 22-16 was unavailable. Thus, count two stated a valid cause of action without alleging standards that constituted unreasonable pollution. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-16 was not unconstitutional by reason of vagueness. Finally, by alleging, as plaintiff did, that effluent negligently released from defendants' drainage system endangered the wetlands on plaintiff's property, plaintiff stated a valid cause of action of private nuisance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer submitted an application to the PZC for development of residential units on its property. After public hearings, the PZC conditionally voted to approve the application, and a resolution permitting it with certain changes was adopted. Plaintiffs sought review thereof. The court initially found that they were aggrieved and had standing to pursue the appeal, based on their ownership of property within the requisite distance of the development. The court found that the planned development district (PDD) complied with &sect; 34. There was no requirement that the PDD provide standards for setbacks and building locations. Adequate notice pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-3(a) was provided to plaintiffs, who appeared and participated in the hearings. The fact that the property was described by an address and referral to the assessor's map rather than by metes and bounds did not render the notice inadequate. Any claim that certain PZC members should have been disqualified was waived. The PDD appeared consistent with the area.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were adjudicated as neglected and were committed to the care, custody and guardianship of DCF. The father was found not to be competent and not restorable to competency. Between the date of the neglect adjudications and dispositions and the date of the end of the TPR hearing, in violation of &sect; 17a-112(j)(3)(B) neither parent was able to rehabilitate herself or himself. The family had not been an intact family for in excess of two years. Thus, the parents did not have the benefit of any presumption that they were fit to care for such children, and, unfortunately for the parents, the evidence was overwhelmingly to the contrary. Over a period of 15 years, the parents had been offered and/or had received a remarkable number of and exhaustive list of individual services and services relating to their children from or facilitated by DCF for purposes of reunification. The court held that DCF had made reasonable efforts to reunite the parents and each of their children. Each child was bonded to the foster parents with whom they resided. It was in the best interest of the children to terminate the parental rights of the biological mother and the biological father.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a town and a zoning enforcement officer, filed a complaint seeking a temporary injunction to allow for inspection of defendant residents' property by the officer after the officer was informed that the property had zoning regulation violations and the residents declined to allow the officer to inspect the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officer received a report that the residents were keeping junk, or maintaining a junkyard, on their property. The officer twice attempted to investigate, but the residents rebuffed his efforts. Nevertheless, the officer spotted vehicles on the residents' lawn that apparently could fit the definition of junk. As a result, the town and officer sought a temporary injunction to overcome the residents' resistance to such an examination, and explained that the town's zoning commission decided how zoning regulations were to be enforced and the officer pursuant to the town zoning regulations was charged with investigating reported violations. The trial court found that the law gave very little indication of the standard that had to be met to obtain a regulatory search warrant. However, it determined that in reviewing the temporary injunction request, the town for the public good and the officer who had jurisdiction needed to be allowed to investigate, as authorized by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8-12 and 8-3 to determine what action, if any, could be taken. It also set forth conditions on the granting of that temporary injunction to make the inspection as unobtrusive as possible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ordered that a temporary injunction be issued and set forth conditions regarding it so that an inspection of the property could occur that would be the least intrusive inspection for the residents.</SPAN></P>

The counts claimed discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12112 et seq., retaliatory discrimination, a violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-238.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that the son was injured while in the care and custody of the Department when he was allowed to consume peanut butter despite a well-documented peanut allergy and that he was discriminated against by the Commissioner since the occurrence of that incident. The Commissioner sought to dismiss the counts at issue based on sovereign immunity. The mother conceded that count three, alleging disability discrimination, should be dismissed and that counts four and six could only stand in order to obtain injunctive relief. The court dismissed counts three and seven completely and counts four and six in part. Counts four and six could not be pursued to the extent of obtaining money damages as Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-99 did not serve as a waiver of sovereign immunity as to those damages. However, because sufficient facts were pleaded to indicate that the Commissioner, through his agents, discriminated against the son in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-71, injunctive relief could be claimed. Count seven had to be dismissed because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-238 did not establish a cause of action separate from that permitted for negligence by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-24.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion to dismiss counts three and seven in their entirety and counts four and six only to the extent that money damages were sought.

The Connecticut Appellate Court upheld the denial of the suppression motion. The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. VI, and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The habeas court held that differences in a trooper's testimony and the police report were minor. Defense counsel properly argued credibility, and the suppression court found that the troopers' testimony that consent to the search had been given was more credible. The failure to determine whether there had been a videotape of the stop, or to review the audio or transcripts of the police dispatch call did not constitute ineffective assistance as there was no evidence as to their existence or substance. The decision not to pursue a probable cause hearing was a strategic matter. It was not shown that the appellate brief was substandard. No prejudice was shown in the late filing of the petition for certification. No prejudice was shown in the failure to determine that the inmate was drug-dependent as the inmate entered a nolo contendere plea. The inmate did not establish that he would have proceeded to a trial if he had known of a drug dependency claim. Finally, the inmate failed to show that he would have received a more favorable result had he taken the case to trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of murder following a bench trial and was sentenced. Thereafter, petitioner filed a pro se second amended petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging the calculation and application of statutory good time credits, and claiming that trial defense trial counsel failed to provide effective assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with murder after a 19-year-old woman was stabbed to death in 1977. He was found guilty and sentenced to a prison term of not less than 25 years nor more than life. His conviction was reversed on appeal. After a retrial, a jury, in 1983, found him guilty of murder. He received the same sentence as before. Petitioner on appeal raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel, but the state supreme court in affirming stated the claim should be raised in a habeas corpus proceeding. About 20 years later, he filed the second amended petition for writ of habeas corpus and raised the effective assistance of counsel issue, less than one year after his trial counsel had died. Petitioner also claimed that his life sentence should have been changed to a 60-year sentence pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-35b. Regarding the sentence, the trial court found that an indeterminate sentence could be applied to pre-1981 offenses and that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-35b only involved determinate sentences imposed after 1981. It then found as to the ineffective assistance claim that his inexcusable delay of 18 years in waiting to raise the issue meant it was forfeited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the second amended petition for writ of habeas corpus filed by petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been able to get along with his neighbor, but a dispute led to animosity between the two men. The neighbor, who was white, bought and displayed a Confederate flag. Defendant, who was Hispanic, responded by spray painting a tarp he hung on a fence and the fence itself with the letters &quot;KKK.&quot; Defendant was charged with breach of peace in the second degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-181(a)(4), disorderly conduct in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-182(a)(2), and harassment in the second degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-183(a)(2). Following a trial, the jury convicted him of each of those charges. Defendant then filed posttrial motions to overturn the jury's verdicts. The trial court found that defendant's alleged criminal conduct consisted of pure speech. It then found that for the statutes for each of the crimes to not be found unconstitutional as applied, the statements that defendant expressed had to be able to be understood as &quot;fighting words,&quot; which were not constitutionally protected. It concluded that defendant had to be acquitted on each of the three charges because the State did not prove that the statements were &quot;fighting words.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an alleged sexual abuse victim, sued defendant archdiocese, which had employed the alleged abuser, claiming negligent, reckless, and wanton conduct and violations of the child abuse reporting statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-101a. The diocese moved to strike several allegations of negligence, claiming they were not justiciable as they would involve a constitutionally impermissible involvement in matters of internal church governance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged, inter alia, the archdiocese was negligent in failing to evaluate the mental fitness of the clergyman who abused him when he was a child; failing to investigate and report his suspicious conduct; and failing to establish a policy of reporting and investigating clergy engaged in sexual misconduct. The court held that the bulk of the allegations attacked by the archdiocese were negligent hiring and supervision claims that could be decided by neutral tort standards without delving into church doctrine or religious practices in violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I. But as the constitutional guarantee of the free exercise of religious authority required secular institutions to defer to the decisions of religious institutions in their employment relations with their religious employees, allegations involving the clergyman's fitness to be a priest, as well as his and the archdiocese's relationship with the members of the congregation, impermissibly intruded on church doctrine or practices. As the complaint did not allege any failure to report the priest's abuse of the plaintiff, it failed to state a claim under &sect; 17a-101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to strike was granted as to the allegations that the archdiocese violated &sect; 17a-101, the allegations involving the clergyman's fitness to be a priest, and the allegations involving the clergyman's and archdiocese's relationship with members of the congregation. The motion to strike was otherwise denied.</SPAN></P>

The Archdiocese filed a motion, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 10-39, to strike several individual allegations of negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim claimed that he was sexually abused by a Roman Catholic priest of the Archdiocese. The Archdiocese claimed that certain of the victim's allegations involved matters of internal church governance and clergy employment decisions which were not justiciable as they were protected from government intrusion by the religion clauses of the United States and Connecticut Constitutions. In addition, the Archdiocese argued that the victim did not have a cause of action based on the failure to report suspected abuse of another child. The court found that the bulk of the allegations attacked by the Archdiocese were subject to neutral tort standards and did not delve into church doctrine or religious practices. However, the allegations involving the priest's fitness to be a priest as well as his and the Archdiocese's relationship with the Catholic faithful required such an impermissible intrusion. As to the claims related to a failure to report under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-101a, neither of the cited allegations of the complaint referred to a failure to have reported abuse of the victim; therefore, they failed to state a cause of action based on the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the State of Connecticut, filed an action against defendants, a construction manager, contractors, and design professionals, to recover for their alleged defective design and construction of a university law library. The manager, contractors, and professionals filed motions to strike counts of the complaint and motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manager entered into a contract with the State to furnish construction management services in connection with the project. The State experienced problems with water intrusion into the library. The superior court held that the manager was entitled to rely upon and receive the benefits of the limitation on suit provision in the contract. The State, by the terms of the contract, agreed to the incorporation of a seven-year period of repose by reference to the period of repose applicable to professional design work under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584a (1995). It waited more than twelve years after completion of the project, and nearly twice as long as the period of repose agreed to in the contract, to bring the action. The legislature intended the State to abide by the statutes of repose, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect;52-577, 52-577a, 52-584 and 52-584a. The breach of contract claims were barred by the statute of limitations set out in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-576. The action was brought six years beyond the six-year limitation period. The State chose not to initiate its action until twelve years after it became aware of the water intrusion. That length of time was unduly burdensome and unexplained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court granted the manager's motion to strike, the motions for summary judgment, and the motions to strike the counts of the complaint alleging breach of contract. The motions to strike three special defenses were denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Planning and Zoning Commission voted to approve the application for a re-subdivision by defendant developer. Plaintiff abutting property owner commenced an action challenging the developer's decision to approve the application. The appeal challenged only two of the three lots.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The re-subdivision was to be into three lots from acreage of 33.10 acres all in a General Business zone. The chief claim of the abutting owner was that the maps or plans submitted by the developer did not show the subjects of the application to be in the proper zone. It was the abutting owner's claim that the property was not entirely in a General Business Zone but that it was partially residential. The court held there was substantial evidence that the subject property was all in a General Business zone including the actual town's Zoning Map which showed the zone line running along the property line. It was clear to the court that the developer included in its approval a modification to conform on the plan the conformity of the zone line and the property line. The court found that with the evidence, the Commission could reasonably have found that the developer had submitted substantial evidence that it had met the regulations, zoning and subdivision, that applied to the application. Moreover, the court found that the decision of the Commission in approving the application for a re-subdivision was reasonable and properly decided. It was not illegal or an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and was sentenced pursuant to the terms of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-35a(2) (Rev. to 1995) to a fifty-year term of imprisonment. Later, defendant sought to correct this sentence on the ground that it was illegal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Specifically, defendant argued that his sentence was illegal in that &sect; 53a-35a, the statute upon which defendant's sentence was based, was not validly enacted by the legislature. The court found that defendant's claim was a challenge to the constitutionality of the legislative enactment rather than to the imposition of the sentence or the sentencing proceeding itself. In making this claim, defendant attempted to advance a claim which was outside the court's subject matter jurisdiction under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 43-22.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother filed an administrative appeal from a decision of a Department of Children and Families (DCF) hearing officer that dismissed her efforts to appeal a denial of her request for services for her autistic son. The hearing officer concluded that dismissal was mandatory under regulations that were interpreted as prohibiting voluntary services if a neglect petition was pending.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the mother's application for services was denied, she was aggrieved for purposes of standing to appeal. The court found that Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 17a-11-8(b) did not require denial of voluntary services without exception, but provided for waiver pursuant to Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 17a-11-11. A waiver was not considered. The mother was not notified of the decision or of her right to a hearing under Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 17-11-11(e) and (g). The agency's failure to follow its regulations prejudiced the mother's substantial rights--she and her son lost a chance to apply for help obtaining services without paying the heavy price of loss of guardianship and commitment. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-129 offered that chance. The hearing officer had express authority to review the denial of the application, including application of the restrictions. The DCF's action in Juvenile Court, at the time of the DCF hearing, sought the commitment of a daughter, not the son. Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 17a-11-18(e) was designed to secure order, system and dispatch in proceedings. Inflexible application of the regulations erroneously precluded evaluation of the application's merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the appeal and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the lessor of a vehicle involved in an auto accident, filed a motion for permission to file a motion for summary judgment in plaintiff's negligence action, which alleged vicarious liability against the lessor. Consideration was given to both the motion for permission to file and the motion for summary judgment itself. The vehicle was leased by defendant company and was driven by defendant, the owner of the company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As there were no objections to the filing of the motion for summary judgment, the court granted the motion for permission to file. It then granted summary judgment on the merits. 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106(a) clearly preempted the ability of plaintiff to bring a claim under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-15a against the lessor for liability for the damage caused by the leased vehicle and or the lessee. Plaintiff's claim that &sect; 30106 was unconstitutional failed as there was a clear, self-evident relation between interstate commerce and the leasing of motor vehicles. There was no genuine issue of material fact that plaintiff sought to impose vicariously liability upon the lessor pursuant to Conn. &sect; 14-154a, and that plaintiff did not allege any negligence or criminal wrongdoing by the lessor. As a result, the lessor had met its burden to show that, as a matter of law, it was entitled to summary judgment because &sect; 30106 barred the action against the lessor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the lessor's motion for permission to file its motion for summary judgment and then granted the motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. After being appointed counsel, he filed a revised second amended petition, alleging that his convictions for violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-54a, -54b(8), and -48 were illegal because they were based on a probable cause hearing in which his public defender was unconstitutionally burdened by a conflict of interest and that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no actual conflict of interest that tainted a public defender's representation of the inmate. A witness represented by the public defender's office on unrelated charges may have been under investigation for the same crimes, but he was never arrested or charged. Co-counsel's trial representation was not ineffective because she made no trial decisions. The inmate did not show how he was prejudiced by trial counsel's failure to call an impeachment witness. However, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate possible alibi witnesses. Contacting one of the two people the inmate had named would have led to the discovery of alibi evidence that would have served as a substantial counterweight to the evidence of guilt and was more likely than not to have put a reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds. The inmate met his burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that had counsel conducted an adequate investigation, he would have discovered the alibi witnesses. Failure to do so constituted deficient performance that prejudiced the inmate, cast appreciable doubt on the case, and undermined the court's confidence in the outcome of the criminal trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the conviction and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner of the Department of Children and Families (DCF) filed an emergency motion for modification of visitation by the parents of two children under Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first stated that although parents had a constitutionally protected right to raise and care for their own children, this right was not free from intervention by the state when its continuing parens patriae interest in the well-being of children was deemed by law to supersede parental interests. The family here had not been intact for over four years, and during that period no judge had determined that there was a basis for immediate reunification and that the children should be returned to the parents. Having the DCF determine, pursuant to &sect; 17a-10a, the requirements of the amount, type and location of visitation that was in the best interest of the children when the DCF had the benefit of its workers' observations, school reports, and the input of the children's therapist did not violate the parents' constitutional rights. Next, the court would continue the hearing with respect to whether visitation with the first child should be suspended. Because &sect; 17a-10a applied to any visitation with the second child, the DCF was expected to act in accordance with its statutory duties, and there was no need or basis to continue the hearing as to the second child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court continued the hearing as to the first child. It did not continue the hearing as to the second child. It held that &sect; 17a-10a did not violate the parents' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff telephone company filed a complaint against defendant, the Connecticut Department of Transportation (DOT), alleging under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-556 that a DOT employe negligently operated a state owned motor vehicle that caused damage to the company's equipment. The DOT filed a motion to dismiss asserting lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company's equipment was damaged as a result of the operation of a backhoe in an excavation. Section 52-556 waived sovereign immunity regarding injuries caused by the operation of a vehicle. However, to attain subject matter jurisdiction through &sect; 52-556, the vehicle in question had to be a motor vehicle and it had to be utilized as a motor vehicle at the time of the accident. &quot;Operation of a vehicle&quot; required driving or moving the vehicle. In the instant case, while the backhoe could be operated as a vehicle, there was no evidence to suggest that the backhoe was in motion as a motor vehicle during the excavation. The evidence provided by both sides established that it would be virtually impossible to place the backhoe in motion when the hoe was in operation. The company's complaint itself stated that the damage to its equipment occurred during the course of excavation work. As it was impossible to operate the backhoe as a motor vehicle at the time the damage to the company's property occurred, the doctrine of sovereign immunity deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court found that (1) the owner failed to satisfy the elements of malicious prosecution because the prosecution commenced upon a finding of probable cause; (2) the enforcement of the law was not conduct beyond the bounds of decent society; (3) the emotional distress which the owner claimed to have suffered for her arrest was not outside the range of normal experience; (4) the inspector and his supervisor were entitled to qualified immunity on the federal claim; (5) any harm to which the owner was subjected was not imminent; (6) the towns did not have a duty to indemnify under Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm, carrying a pistol without a permit, and tampering with physical evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had been charged with murder. He alleged trial counsel was ineffective for requesting a jury charge on the lesser offense of first degree manslaughter with a firearm (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-55a) without also requesting a charge of first degree manslaughter (Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-55), and that appellate counsel were ineffective for failure to challenge his conviction of manslaughter with a firearm. The court disagreed. The inmate was not prejudiced by counsel's failure to request a charge of first degree manslaughter because he was not entitled to that instruction. To convict him of murder, the State had to prove he intended to cause the death of the victim; that acting with such intent, he did cause the death of the victim; and that he used a firearm to cause the death of the victim. The jury necessarily found he committed all three of these elements before acquitting him of murder by reason of extreme emotional disturbance; therefore, it found that the murder was committed with a firearm. Thus, the jury could not have rationally convicted him of first degree manslaughter instead of first degree manslaughter with a firearm.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer and other members of a narcotics team were conducting surveillance and saw a vehicle stop in the center of the street. After observing what appeared to be a hand to hand drug transaction between the driver of the vehicle and defendant, who was in another car, the officer then directed another officer to approach defendant's car. The officer approached with his gun drawn and saw defendant holding money and a plastic bag containing smaller bags with a white powder. In denying defendant's motion to suppress, the court rejected defendant's contention that the officer's actions constituted an arrest. The stop was an investigative stop; thus, probable cause was not required. The officer's use of a weapon did not turn the investigative stop into a de facto arrest; instead, his approach of the vehicle with his weapon drawn was not unreasonable in light of the recognized connection between weapons and drug dealing. Reasonable suspicion supported the investigative stop. Given the similarities between the transaction observed by the officer on surveillance and the hundreds of drug transactions he had observed in the past, the officer's suspicions were more than a hunch.</SPAN></P>

During that conversation, the officer noticed that defendant's speech was slurred, an odor of alcohol, and a glassy appearance to defendant's eyes. In support of his motion to suppress, defendant claimed that the officer lacked reasonable and articulable suspicion to initiate the stop because his vehicle was larger than that described by a witness and the time lapse between the accident and the stop. The court found that the officer was justified as no make of vehicle was provided in the broadcast and the location was not far from the accident. The court also found that the stop was not unduly prolonged when the officer approached defendant after examining the vehicle to explain.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff vendor filed an application for a temporary injunction against defendants, the State of Connecticut, the Connecticut Department of Public Safety, and its Commissioner, after defendants' warrantless seizure of the vendor's fireworks (&quot;fountains&quot; as defined by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-356(3)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After reviewing chemical composition data sheets, defendants seized fountains from two of vendor's locations, claiming they violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-357 because, inter alia, they contained more than five grams of chlorate or erchlorate salts. The court declined to review a ruling of a court of coordinate jurisdiction as to fountains seized from the vendor's second location. The vendor presented no persuasive evidence it would suffer irreparable harm to its reputation if an injunction was not granted. Money damages were an adequate remedy for any loss. The State's interest in protecting the public from illegal fireworks far outweighed the injuries the vendor complained of. The vendor was unlikely to succeed on the merits: (1) the court could not correct a legislative error in &sect; 29-357, even assuming one existed; (2) federal regulations did not preempt the State's statutory scheme regulating fountains; (3) warrantless inspections of fireworks businesses under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-362 complied with New York v. Burger and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment; and (4) the post-deprivation hearing mandated by &sect; 29-362 provided due process to vendors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state representative filed a complaint to prevent defendant, the Connecticut State Elections Enforcement Commission (SEEC), from conducting a hearing on two complaints alleging that the representative violated elections laws governing absentee voting. The SEEC filed a motion to dismiss two counts of the complaint, under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 10-31(a), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The SEEC received complaints from citizens alleging that the state representative violated laws governing absentee voting in connection with a primary election and later committed absentee ballot violations in connection with a general election. The SEEC considered the complaint at meetings and found reason to believe that the representative had violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-140b(e). The chairman of the SEEC, who was present at one of the meetings, was assigned to preside over hearings on the complaints. The representative sought an order preventing the SEEC from proceeding further on the complaints because of due process violations; a declaration that the SEEC's enabling statutes,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9-7a and 9-7b, were facially unconstitutional; and money damages. The court found that the representative failed to articulate how she was to be harmed or prejudiced by awaiting the termination of the hearing process before raising her procedural due process claims. Therefore, the representative's allegations regarding violation of the representative's due process rights were not ripe for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to their reinsurance contracts, defendants agreed to accept liability for certain losses incurred by plaintiffs to its own insureds, if those losses exceeded a certain threshold amount. Plaintiffs paid claims of its policyholders allegedly covered by the terms of the reinsurance contracts and billed defendants for those losses. Defendants claimed the losses were not covered under the contracts. This suit followed. The court held that as defendants were unauthorized to conduct insurance business in Connecticut, under &sect; 38a-27, they had to deposit cash or securities in an amount to be fixed by the court sufficient to pay any judgment. Defendants argued that before ordering such a deposit, the court had to find, after an hearing in which they could raise their defenses, probable cause that plaintiffs would prevail. The court held &sect; 38a-27 did not require such a probable cause determination. Defendants' due process rights were met by plaintiffs' submission of some proof that contracts existed, billings were made under them, and the bills remained unpaid, and by defendants' ability to cross-examine plaintiffs' witnesses and present evidence to counter plaintiffs' evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A lien was placed on the property as a result of a stipulated agreement between the wife and the town's zoning enforcement officer (ZEO) in a prior action after motions for contempt were filed pursuant to an alleged failure to remediate conditions on the property alleged to be a violation of the zoning regulations. Four days before the order was recorded, the husband wrote a letter to the ZEO stating that he would not allow the town to perform the necessary remediation. Approximately a month later, the wife quit claimed her interest in the land to the husband. The court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-351a did not appear to require notice to the husband since he was not a judgment debtor under the lien or the property's owner at the time it was put on the land records. The fact that a debt had not been incurred did not invalidate the lien since it was merely security for future costs for remediation. There was no claim of denial of all economically beneficial or productive use of the land. The physical invasion of the property required by remediation did not require compensation to the husband where it was claimed that zoning regulations or environmental laws had been violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion filed by the state to dismiss the claims for money damages against the teacher in his official capacity. Plaintiffs did not receive a waiver from the claims commissioner to sue the state; thus, the claims were barred by sovereign immunity.  As for the claims against the teacher in his individual capacity, they could be reasonably construed to be directed against the teacher in his individual capacity and were not barred by sovereign immunity. To the extent that plaintiffs pleaded reckless or intentional conduct under the wanton, reckless, or malicious exception to statutory immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-165, those counts were properly before the court and beyond the scope of statutory sovereign immunity. The student failed to sufficiently plead that the teacher's conduct occurred outside the scope of employment. Contact with students was incidental to the duties of a teacher, and to the extent that such contact was merely negligent, as opposed to intentional contact made with improper and self-serving motives, it could not be the basis of a lawsuit against a state employee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the state's motion to dismiss all claims against the teacher in his official capacity.

Defendants moved to strike the negligence counts on grounds of governmental immunity, to strike the breach of state policy counts on grounds of sovereign immunity, and to strike the counts against the town because no claim was asserted against it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent alleged that the board, superintendent, and principal knew his child had been harassed at school; that they failed to protect her from a another child who kicked her during recess; that their conduct was negligent; and that they failed to comply with state bullying policy. The court held that as no cause of action had been alleged against the town, the claims against it had to be stricken. The complaint failed to allege facts showing that the harm was imminent and that it should have been apparent to defendants that their conduct likely subjected the student to the alleged harm. The harm could have potentially occurred at any time during the school day. Thus, defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the negligence claim. The parent alleged defendants failed to implement and follow a bullying policy adopted under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-222d, and that soveriegn immunity did not apply because the board acted on behalf of the town, not the state. The court held board and its employees were acting pursuant to a state-mandated activity set forth in &sect; 10-222d; thus, they were protected by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate became disenchanted with his first attorney because he recommended an acceptance of a pretrial agreement; the first attorney was replaced.

The second attorney was professional in his trial representation of the inmate when the case was presented to the jury.

After the insureds learned that the other driver had only $ 50,000 in coverage, they notified their insurer that they had a potential claim for underinsured motorist benefits under their automobile insurance policy. Their insurer informed the insureds that any claim they filed would be disapproved because it would be filed more than three years after the date the accident occurred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PO's ROW request, in order to gain access to an existing town road from his landlocked parcel, was denied when the subdivision application was granted. Thereafter, the town purchased a strip of the ALO's land that abutted the PO's property. Accordingly, the PO brought suit. The trial court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims under &sect; 1983 and for conspiracy, as they were not ripe for adjudication. The claim under &sect; 1983 did not arise until there was an adverse determination in the IC claim, and the conspiracy claim was based on the allegedly tortious conduct under the &sect; 1983 claim. The court held that the ROW requirement in Wallingford, Conn., Subdivision Regs. VI.A.4 did not apply to a subdivision plan that relied exclusively upon an existing town road on land that was not within the proposed subdivision. However, issues of fact existed as to whether the addition of a cul-de-sac to a road was an on-site or off-site improvement, whether the PO's land constituted &quot;adjoining property susceptible to being subdivided&quot; that constituted a triggering event for the ROW, and whether the PO was deprived of all economically beneficial use of its property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the town's motion to dismiss the claims under &sect; 1983 and alleging a conspiracy. Both parties' motions for summary judgment were denied on the inverse condemnation claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmates sought declaratory relief that their prison living conditions due to overcrowding were unconstitutional and injunctive relief that would result in their reclassification and reassignment to other facilities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates filed a complaint against the commissioner, as well as the warden and deputy warden of the correctional center where they were confined, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief regarding their confinement conditions. They alleged that their confinement, in a small television room with an improperly ventilated toilet area, with several other inmates, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. They specifically contended that the conditions violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 10 and 20. The commissioner, warden, and deputy warden sought dismissal because service of process was not made on them, but, rather, the State. They also alleged that the case was moot because the inmates had been moved to other facilities. The trial court agreed with the commissioner, warden, and deputy warden that proper service had not been made on them. It also found that the only possible exception to mootness was the &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review&quot; exception. However, the trial court found that exception did not apply because the inmates could not show that they likely would be subjected to the same conditions in the future.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A father was awarded sole custody of his child. The court ordered, inter alia, that the maternal grandparents have limited visitation. The mother, then incarcerated, was also given limited access. There were a large number of motions presented by the parties including the grandparents' motion to modify custody, the mother's motion to open and modify judgment, and the father's motion to allocate GAL fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The maternal grandparents had a relationship with the child akin to that of parents. The mother suffered from alcohol and substance abuse issues and had no meaningful relationship with the child. The child, 4 1/2 years of age, was severely autistic and nonverbal. The child was receiving extraordinary educational services. The father had immersed himself in the study of autism and the proper treatment and care of his son. The grandparents believed that the child's doctor's methods were damaging to the child. The court found that belief to be unfounded. The court found that the grandparents and mother were able and willing to honor the orders of the court that the father, as sole custodial parent, was to have final decision-making on all aspects of the child's care and upbringing. The father was clearly the more informed and fit parent. The GAL recommended that the father remain as the sole custodial parent with final decision-making on all aspects of the child's life but that the grandparent's access of every other weekend be continued so long as they abided by the father's medical decisions and that the mother's access occur contemporaneously with that of the grandparents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father was to have sole custody of the child. The maternal grandparents were to enjoy visitation every other weekend. The mother could visit during the grandparent's visitation time or at a professional visitation facility if she so chose. Neither the maternal grandparents nor the mother was to interfere with the father's choice of physician or with the father's choice of medication or educational options.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs wanted to develop a retirement community on land that abutted the town. The road provided the only access to the property. The superior court held that the town properly exercised its police power in closing the road. The town showed that it had legitimate concerns that plaintiffs' proposed development would have serious negative impacts on the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. The town sufficiently established that the road would not be an ideal sole access road. Plaintiffs failed to offer any substantial evidence that alternative means of access to its community through an adjoining town would not be possible. They did not demonstrate that they were without an adequate remedy at law. Plaintiffs could have sought damages based on a taking theory of recovery. Because they did not seek money damages, and they failed to show that they suffered a total and permanent loss of a right of access, they were not entitled to compensatory damages under a taking theory. Plaintiffs did not prove that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-55 applied and that they were entitled to a private right-of-way because they failed to show that the town discontinued or abandoned the road.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff teacher appealed a decision of a hearing officer of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF), which accepted DCF's decision to place the teacher on the Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;17a-101k(a) central registry after the teacher pled guilty to a Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21(a)(1) violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court held that the hearing officer erroneously relied upon DCF policy &sect; 22-12-4 to deny the teacher a hearing on DCF's substantiation of sexual abuse. Section 22-12-4 was based on the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The transcript of the plea hearing did not justify concluding that applying collateral estoppel, or the DCF equivalent, &sect; 22-12-4, was warranted. The teacher admitted guilt to &sect; 53-21(a)(1) only. Section 53-21(a)(1) did not reference illegal sexual activity. The prosecutor stated the charge was based on the victim spending the night with the teacher, and on a number of occasions sleeping with the teacher in his bed. The teacher apologized for mistakes in judgment, endangering the child in question, and for the ordeal the child and family had been subjected to. The admission at the criminal plea hearing could not serve as a justification for denying the teacher a substantiation hearing on DCF's sexual abuse allegations. The matter was not &quot;actually litigated&quot; in criminal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was sustained. The matter was remanded to DCF for a new full hearing on the substantiation of sexual abuse against the teacher.</SPAN></P>

The evidence concerning both the petition and the motion was heard in a single consolidated proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a criminal trial to the court, the defendant was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-13(a). Thereafter, the acquittee was committed for the maximum period to which he could have been sentenced had he been convicted of the underlying offense. The State of Connecticut successfully petitioned for recommitment of the acquittee on four occasions. The acquittee contended that once he reached his maximum term of recommitment, the State's petition for recommitment pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(c) was rendered unconstitutional in both procedure and effect. The court, given the expert testimony as to the acquittee's existing mental state, found by clear and convincing evidence that the acquittee was then mentally ill and dangerous to others. Furthermore, &sect; 17a-593(c) was not unconstitutional as applied to the acquittee. Section 17a-593(c) facially applied only to an acquittee who remained a person with psychiatric disabilities, and the acquittee was mentally ill and dangerous. Finally, it was appropriate for the State to discriminate among psychiatrically disabled individuals on the basis of a proven criminal act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff quarry company claimed that a cease and desist order was improperly issued because the quarry was not violating the Regulations. The quarry also claimed, inter alia, that the limitations on its operations imposed by the cease and desist order deprived it of any reasonable means of obtaining income from its property and was, in effect, a taking of its property under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The quarry claimed that the limitations imposed by the cease and desist order would make the operation of the quarry economically unviable. However, the court noted that the quarry did not claim that it could not continue to operate with one rock cutter or carry on other operations on its property. Accordingly, there was no unconstitutional taking of the quarry's property. The record was replete with evidence offered by neighbors as to the detrimental effect of the quarry operations on the neighborhood. There was no basis for the claim that the cease and desist order would adversely impact the neighborhood. There was no basis for the claim that the use of more than one rock crusher in the quarry would reduce the threat to public safety. To the contrary, testimony from neighbors attested to the substantial adverse effect the use of an additional rock crusher would have on the quality of life of the neighbors. There were no egregious facts involving the chairman's statement to a neighbor and there was no basis for disqualifying him. Moreover, the quarry did not request that the chairman disqualify himself at the hearing. Thus, it could not subsequently raise an objection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmates filed an action against defendant, the governor, the Department of Correction Commissioner, and the warden of a correctional institute, alleging that the conditions of the institute subjected them to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and constituted a deprivation of their constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court held that it was without personal jurisdiction to hear the complaint as to ten of the inmates because they failed to sign the complaint. Only one of the inmates provided a valid signature on the complaint. Because the ten inmate's forged signatures were invalid, those inmates failed to comply with the requirements placed upon pro se litigants under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 8-1, leaving the superior court without personal jurisdiction over defendants as to them. Because the claims against defendants in their official capacities were, in effect, claims against the State, the doctrine of sovereign immunity was implicated, and the superior court was without subject matter jurisdiction to hear those claims. The complaint failed to allege that defendants acted in excess of their statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. The superior court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the claims brought against defendants in their individual capacities. The inmate's allegations were not clear constitutional violations that warranted piercing the protective veil that qualified federal immunity provided to government officials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance filed a two-count, revised complaint asserting subrogation claims arising from a motor vehicle accident. The first count alleged that defendant lessee's negligence in operating the vehicle caused the crash. The second count alleged defendant lessor's vicarious liability for the lessee's alleged negligence. The lessor filed a motion to strike count two of the revised complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee allegedly was involved in a motor vehicle accident while operating a vehicle he had leased from the lessor. The insurance company filed a subrogation complaint alleging that the lessee negligently operated the vehicle. Count two alleged that the lessee's negligence was imputed to the lessor. The lessor sought to strike count two. It explained that the United States Congress had enacted 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106, known as the Graves Amendment, which stated that motor vehicle owners in the vehicle rental business bore no vicarious responsibility for damages arising from rental vehicle use by lessees. The trial court found it had to decide whether a state court could find a federal law unconstitutional and, if so, whether the United States Congress exceeded its authority in enacting 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106. It found a state court had the power to find a federal law unconstitutional when that question properly arose in a state court. It then held, however, that the United States Congress under United States Constitution's Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, reasonably could determine that a nonnegligent lessor was not responsible for their lessees' motor vehicle accidents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the motion to strike count two of the insurance company's revised complaint alleging the lessor's vicarious liability for the lessee's alleged negligence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 47-31 and for declaratory relief under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-29 against defendants, a city and the State of Connecticut Siting Council. Defendants filed motions to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee sold 845 acres to the LLC, which entered into a contract with a utility to sell it the land, except for a 52-acre parcel. The utility was obliged to quitclaim that parcel to the LLC and lease it to the LLC or its nominee (the lessee). The Council issued a certificate allowing the utility to build a power plant on the 845 acres. The utility assigned its rights under its contract with the LLC to an assignee, which bought the 845 acres, subject to the lease. The Council brought an enforcement action to compel the assignee to transfer 357 acres to the city; this land contained the 52-acre parcel. These parties settled; they stipulated that the 357 acres would be transferred and that the lease would be listed as an encumbrance on the deed to the city. The lessee alleged the city prevented it from taking possession of the land. The court held that as plaintiffs failed to timely appeal the Council's actions under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183(a), their challenge to the Council's order to transfer land to the city was barred. But as the Council did not make a ruling on the lease's validity, the city's motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies failed.</SPAN></P>

The superior court held that the disputed paragraph constituted the entirety of the owners' taking claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff foster parent sued defendants, a child services agency and several of its employees, seeking monetary damages for the intentional infliction of emotional distress and willful, wanton, and reckless misconduct. The action stemmed from the removal of foster children to whom the foster parents were related. The agency moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency argued that the complaint against it was barred by sovereign immunity. The foster parents conceded that they had not received permission to sue the State. Case law recognized two limited exceptions to the State's sovereign immunity, namely, when: (1) the legislature statutorily waived immunity; and (2) in an action for declaratory or injunctive relief, the state officers against whom such relief was sought acted in excess of statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. Because there was no evidence that the legislature had statutorily waived the State's immunity, the first exception to the sovereign immunity doctrine was inapplicable. Additionally, since the foster parents sought monetary damages, the second exception was also inapplicable. Thus, neither exception to the sovereign immunity rule having been met, the doctrine of sovereign immunity protected the agency from having to litigate the claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss was granted. The individually named agency employees were not addressed by the court's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants cut many trees from property belonging to the town's land trust. An action was filed under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-44(a), and as a result, numerous other actions were filed by a variety of parties. Judgment was entered against defendants for violating a regulation of the commission and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22a-16 and 22a-42a(c)(1). Plaintiffs thereupon sought summary judgment in numerous other actions that were pending. The court initially determined that civil rights counterclaims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging violations of the procedural and substantive due process clauses, were barred by res judicata from further review, as they had been previously disposed of in a summary judgment ruling in a prior, related federal action. As the cease and desist order under &sect; 22a-44(a) was effectively terminated by the issuance of injunctive relief under &sect; 22a-44(b), issues regarding a hearing thereon and requests for extraordinary remedies were deemed moot. As there was no taking of the property, an inverse condemnation claim under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and U.S. Const. amend. V failed. Multiple tort claims asserted in the actions all failed for assorted reasons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company sought to strike the complaint on the ground that 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106, the Graves Amendment, barred any personal injury or property damage action against rental car companies for whom the claim of negligence was imputed solely by virtue of their status as owner of a vehicle. Plaintiff argued that the Graves Amendment was an unconstitutional exercise of power under the commerce clause. The court found no facts in support of the company's negligence above and beyond the negligence alleged against the driver of the vehicle, an employee of the company. The court could plainly infer from the allegations in the complaint and the business name of the company that it was engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles, and plaintiff did not attempt to argue otherwise.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, limited liability companies, small businesses, and corporations, filed an action against defendant town, alleging violations of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 7-130i, 7-148, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110a et seq. The town filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the revenues the town derived from building permit fees were significantly in excess of the cost relating to offering and regulating building activity and that the town unlawfully used the fees to fund its general operations, social programs, and other initiatives. The superior court held that plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue their &sect; 7-130i claim. There was no private cause of action under &sect; 7-130i, which did not relate in any way to building permit fees. Plaintiffs did not provide the superior court with a basis to conclude that the town's alleged violation of &sect; 7-148(c)(2)(B) provided them with a private cause of action for money damages. They gave no support for their contention that Conn. Const. art. 10, &sect;&sect; 1 and 2 provided for a private cause of action for money damages. Plaintiffs did not have a cause of action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because the imposition of a fee did not give rise to a takings claim. There was no appellate or supreme court case that provided municipalities with blanket immunity against CUTPA claims. Therefore, on the face of CUPTA, plaintiffs had no issue with subject matter jurisdiction or with standing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court granted the town's motion to dismiss in part but found that plaintiffs' CUTPA claim survived the motion.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a. The owner filed a motion to strike the vicarious liability claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was operating a van when defendant driver, who was operating a vehicle owned by a car rental agency, lost control of her vehicle and stuck the van. In support of its motion to strike, the owner alleged that 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106, the Graves Amendment, prevented the imposition of vicarious liability on the vehicles of a commercial car lessor. The court first concluded that whether the owner filed a &quot;speaking motion&quot; as alleged by plaintiff was immaterial because the complaint alleged that the owner had a car rental business and that defendant driver had rented the vehicle she was driving at the time of the accident. Plaintiff also argued that the Graves Amendment was an unconstitutional exercise of power under the commerce clause. The court disagreed, noting that the authority relied on by plaintiff was neither binding on the court nor persuasive authority. The court did agree with the owner that the action was barred by federal law, as &sect; 14-154a was abrogated by the Graves Amendment, as provided for in &sect; 30106.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff minority leader of a town's board of aldermen filed an action for quo warranto against a member of the Waterbury Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission (WIWWC member), an action for quo warranto against a member of the town's zoning commission (zoning commission member), and an action for mandamus against certain other members of the zoning commission (commission).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court rejected the WIWWC member's claims that the 2002 charter revision commission's intent in inserting the word &quot;party&quot; into Waterbury, Conn., Charter ch. 4, &sect; 4-2(b)(1) was to require the minority leader to recommend members of his or her own party, and that &sect; 4-2(b)(1) applied to boards, but not commissions, as they could have been raised in a prior quo warranto action. The WIWWC member was ineligible to serve as he was not on the list of minority members proposed by the minority leader. The WIWWC member was ousted. Section 4-2(b)(2) did not require the board of aldermen or boards or commissions to consult the minority leader's list when making minority appointments. The last sentence of &sect; 4-2(b)(2) referred to other charter provisions that clearly pertained to the zoning commission, and did not require that the boards or commissions consult the minority leader's list when making minority appointments to boards or commissions. Thus, the zoning commission member rightfully occupied her position on the zoning commission, even though she was not on the minority leader's list. The petition for a writ of mandamus as to the commission was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner moved to dismiss. The trial court noted that the commissioner argued that he only had to provide funding for CHCPE benefits, and that the provider made an independent decision not to service the client. The case was not moot as it could be determined that the commissioner's obligations went beyond funding. The matter was ripe for adjudication. Whether the client was entitled to a private right of action was to be determined on a motion to strike. The client was classically aggrieved as she was in need of home health care. The deprivation of benefits gave the client a specific, personal, and legal interest. The client had standing to bring the action, regardless of whether the statutes allowed for a private right of action. The requests for declaratory and injunctive relief demanded a clarification of the commissioner's responsibilities. The request for attorneys fees was not barred as monetary damages under Eleventh Amendment immunity. The commissioner was a &quot;person&quot; under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The request for injunctive relief to compel the commissioner to provide benefits for the client did not implicate the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that there was a rational basis for Congress to conclude that state statutes imposing liability on car rental agencies for the actions of lessees in the absence of negligence or wrongdoing would affect interstate commerce and have an effect on such commerce for purposes of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. The franchisee leased vehicles that could be used in interstate commerce and thus its business was inextricably bound up with that commerce. The rental agreement provided that permission was granted to operate the vehicle only in the state of rental and certain specified states and stated that operation in any other state or county would affect the lessee's liability and rights under the agreement. It was contemplated that the cars might be operated in interstate commerce. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154(a), by imposing added operational costs on car rental companies not imposed on other interstate travel providers, had an effect on interstate commerce that Congress could preempt. 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106(a) had a commercial nexus to the operation of car rental companies and their consumers in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The CMHC provided the inmate with medial care including treatment with the NSAIDS. The inmate was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux and scarring of the duodenal bulb, allegedly due to his consumption of NSAIDS and a failure to provide guides, labeling and/or package inserts. The court held the inmate failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because he did not follow the appellate procedures provided for in the FOIA. The employees responded that they checked with CMHC's drug wholesalers and found that it would be virtually impossible to identify specific data to support the FOIA request. In addition, there were a number of years where the pharmaceutical care of the inmates had been privatized and few records were available to the specifics. The inmate failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the FOIA. He failed to serve the Freedom of Information Commission or the Attorney General, and directed his suit solely at the university employees. Therefore, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court (Connecticut) treated a motion to strike filed by defendants, including a doctor (doctor), as a motion to dismiss, ordered a medical malpractice case dismissed, and sustained an objection to a request for leave to amend a complaint. Plaintiff patient's motion to reargue was granted to allow the patient to raise the issue of whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-190a, if so applied, was constitutional under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the written opinion letter was insufficient, and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. Medical negligence existed as a cause of action at common law prior to 1818 and thus became incorporated into the Connecticut Constitution by the adoption of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. There was no alternative remedy. However, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-190a did not abolish the ability to bring a medical negligence case, but merely required the patient to document the fact that there was evidence to support such a claim before bringing suit. There was nothing insurmountable about this requirement. Second, it was certainly reasonable. Section 52-190a was enacted to discourage the filing of baseless lawsuits against health care providers. The patient could not claim a pre-constitutional right to have an attorney bring a groundless lawsuit. Accordingly, &sect; 52-190a did not abridge or abrogate any pre-constitutional rights of action of the patient. The statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order dismissing the case and sustaining the objection to the request for leave to amend the complaint were reinstated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother obtained a temporary injunction against defendant government officials to prevent them from suspending her 16-year-old son's right to attend high school until further order after efforts were made to suspend him following his off-campus arrest for marijuana possession. Defendant officials were directed to appear at a show cause hearing, which they attended, to explain why the temporary injunction should not be continued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son, a high school student, was arrested off campus and charged with marijuana possession offenses. One official, an assistant principal, confronted the son. A school resources officer joined the meeting to advise the son. The school administration made a decision to suspend him. The administration then notified the mother who obtained an injunction permitting the son to return to the school. The administration recommended Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233d expulsion proceedings. The mother alleged, inter alia, that the son was suspended without a proper hearing, suspended without an &quot;informal hearing&quot; in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233c, and that his criminal case had to be concluded before he was entitled to a school hearing. The trial court found that  neither Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233d nor Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233c violated his rights because (1) the school was not required to give the son Miranda warnings, (2) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233c protected the son's due process rights, (3) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233c regarding suspensions was not unconstitutionally vague, and (4) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233d regarding expulsions was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 52-471 compelling the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles to not continue past February 2008, the term of the operator's license suspension after her third suspension for drunk driving under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the operator complained of a three-year suspension imposed for a violation of &sect; 14-227b due to the operator's refusal to submit to a blood, breath, or urine test as the operator was a multiple offender. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-227a and 14-227b were clear under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-2z. The Commissioner could impose the three-year suspension and to refuse the use of an interlocking ignition device (IID) to the operator. The state action survived constitutional scrutiny. The suspension and the Commissioner's rejection of the operator's request to allow her to operate her vehicle with an IID were reasonable and necessary to achieve the goal of protecting the public safety. The Commissioner was acting within his statutory authority, and the decision was not arbitrary or an abuse of discretion. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a(i) permitted the Commissioner to allow the installation of an IID for a driver whose license was suspended only if the suspension was not for &quot;any other reason.&quot; The suspension was for a Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b violation, which constituted &quot;another&quot; reason. The operator's action was barred by the State's sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The station owner contended that the imposition of clean-up costs, exceeding the value of his property, constituted an unconstitutional taking; that the hearing officer's conclusion that the station owner was not an innocent landowner under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-452d was erroneous; and that the hearing officer's bias toward the Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) witnesses deprived him of a fair hearing. The court concluded that the station owner did not establish an innocent landowner defense. Among other things, the station owner's inquiries of the seller were not adequate, the contamination addendum to the sale contract was a &quot;red flag&quot; that should have alerted the station owner to such issues, and the failure to contact DEP was relevant. The court further concluded that no taking of the property occurred and the owner was not entitled to compensation for the diminution of value of his property resulting from a valid exercise of police power. As for the DEP witnesses, the court found that counsel for the station owner was allowed to and in fact did demonstrate the possibility of bias given the employee-employer relationship between the witnesses and the DEP.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant inmate was convicted of forgery and larceny, and then pled guilty to committing the crimes while on release on bond and being a persistent larceny offender. The inmate was sentenced in abstentia to an enhanced sentence under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-40b. He was not sentenced as a persistent larceny offender. The inmate's motion to correct an illegal sentence was denied. On remand after an appeal, the motion was again denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling was affirmed by the Connecticut Appellate Court. The trial court rejected the inmate's claim that a prior conviction used to enhance a penalty was not allowed because he was not represented when he was out on bond and committed the subsequent crimes. The inmate was not &quot;denied&quot; counsel in the two earlier pending cases. He did not even request to have counsel appointed in those two 1993 arrests until April 26, 1994. The enhanced sentence imposed on him was not predicated upon his guilt or innocence in those earlier cases. It was specifically predicated upon the inmate's arrest for crimes (which he subsequently admitted) while out on bond in those two cases. Section &sect; 53a-40b did not contemplate the need for a subsequent conviction of the prior charges in order for the sanction under &sect; 53a-40b to be invoked. The text of &sect; 53a-40b did not refer expressly to a prior conviction as a predicate act that triggered an enhanced penalty. It focused, instead, on the status of a defendant when he or she committed a second crime. The inmate's guilt or innocence as to those earlier pending charges was of no consequence to the applicability of &sect; 53a-40b.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to strike argued that the medical malpractice case should be dismissed because the patient failed to attach to her complaint a detailed written opinion from a similar health care provider finding evidence of medical negligence, as required by Conn.

The trial court held that the patient did not present a new argument or a persuasive reason for revisiting the findings that the opinion attached to the complaint was not detailed, and that &sect; 52-190a(c) required dismissal. However, the motion to reargue was granted with respect to the new claim that the opinion letter requirement in &sect; 52-190a was unconstitutional if used to dismiss her case with an insufficient opinion letter because it would deny the patient her right to seek redress in the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, death row inmates, filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the death penalty in Connecticut was unconstitutional because it was imposed in a racially and geographically discriminatory basis. Respondent Commissioner of Correction filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that petitioners failed to assert their claim with due diligence, and they advanced a claim that was patently devoid of evidentiary support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The habeas court held that petitioners acted with due diligence in pursuing the litigation. No court orders had been violated, and no dates upon which pleadings were required had been missed. The habeas court concluded that petitioners stated a claim upon which it could grant relief. Petitioners could seek to demonstrate that the imposition of the death penalty in Connecticut violated the Constitution of the State of Connecticut, even though such a statistical attack could be unavailing on the federal level. The petition alleged that there was impermissible racial disparity and other impermissible factors that crept into the decisions to charge, to prosecute, to impose, and to inflict the death penalty. It clearly asserted that that was a violation of the Connecticut Constitution. The habeas court stated that the denial of the motion to dismiss would not prejudice the Commissioner's right to seek summary judgment or to renew a motion for judgment following petitioners' presentation of their case. However, petitioners stated a cognizable claim and averred that there was evidence to support that claim. Therefore, they were entitled to proceed with the trial of that claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed a pro se complaint against defendant prison instructor alleging that the instructor made a replacement makeshift safety guard that malfunctioned, leading to the inmate cutting his thumb severely on a band saw. The instructor filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted. The inmate moved for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that although the complaint did not indicate in which capacity the instructor appeared, the inmate served the instructor through the Connecticut Attorney General's Office, which was the manner used for serving a state officer under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-64. The inmate stated that the Connecticut Attorney General was the appropriate agent to accept service for state employees. The marshal's return indicated that he served process at the Attorney General's Office. The inmate did not serve process under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-57. Therefore, the inmate sued the instructor only in his official capacity. The summons indicated that the inmate sought both money damages and other relief. Since the instructor appeared in his official capacity only, and the inmate failed to cite any statutory authority abrogating sovereign immunity for a money damages claim, sovereign immunity barred the monetary damages claim. The inmate did not allege that the instructor acted in excess of statutory authority or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. Rather, the complaint sounded in negligence. Therefore, the case did not fit into the injunctive relief exception to sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, plaintiff inmate filed suit against defendants, a nurse and a correctional officer (CO), in their individual capacities, alleging violations of the Fourteenth Amendment. The nurse and the CO moved to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 barred the suit and that the inmate failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to a disability, the inmate required medication. As the inmate was receiving his medication from the nurse, the CO was standing over her. Because of the CO's proximity to the nurse, the nature of the medication was disclosed to him. The inmate alleged that this information was confidential, and that the release of the information caused him humiliation. The trial court held that since 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was a federal statute, the law of Connecticut required that federal immunity law be applied. Under federal law, qualified immunity was an affirmative defense. The defense did not attack the jurisdiction of the court, and, therefore, a motion to dismiss was not the proper motion for such a claim. The nurse and the CO's claim that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 required any inmate suing a state employee to exhaust administrative remedies with the claims commissioner was rejected as federal law trumped state law, and a state statute could not provide governmental immunity from 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court had jurisdiction to hear the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate filed an action pursuant to state constitutional law and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against defendants, a corrections officer and the Connecticut Claims Commissioner. He alleged violations of his state and federal rights to due process and equal protection of the law. Defendants moved to dismiss on the grounds that the commissioner was entitled to absolute immunity, and that both were entitled to sovereign and statutory immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that the officer and commissioner unlawfully disposed of his property and did not authorize him to file a suit against the State to recover the property. The court held that it was without subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case. The commissioner was entitled to absolute judicial immunity for actions undertaken in the performance of his adjudicative role. Neither the legislature nor the commissioner authorized suit against the commissioner and officer. Because the inmate failed to show that the officer or commissioner impaired his equal protection or due process rights the exception to sovereign immunity occasioned by a State agent violating constitutional imperatives did not apply. The inmate did not allege that the officer and commissioner operated outside the scope of their employment when adjudicating his property claim or that they acted wilfully or maliciously. Therefore, the court had no subject matter jurisdiction to hear the inmate's State claims because the officer and commissioner were cloaked in the immunity afforded by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165. The court concluded that there was no a violation of the inmate's federal constitutional liberties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner filed an action against defendants, a town, a planning and zoning commission, and a realty company, alleging, among other things, that the company conspired with the town and commission to deprive it of substantive property rights in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The company's answer contained special defenses, stating that it had qualified immunity from liability. The landowner moved to strike the special defenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company's property bounded on one side of the landowner's property. The commission approved the company's application for a subdivision. The landowner appealed. The company listed a portion of its property for sale. The landowner claimed that the company rejected its offer to purchase the property. It also argued that the town and company engaged in a conspiracy that culminated in the town's purchase of a portion of the land, which included a strip that cut off the landowner's only access to a road. As a result of the conspiracy, the landowner alleged that it was deprived of the value of its property, the town's zoning regulations were subverted, and the pending appeal of the commission's decision was rendered moot. The superior court held that the company's special defenses were legally insufficient because the protection afforded by the doctrine of qualified immunity applied only to municipal employees who were sued in their personal names. Qualified immunity did not protect a private defendant against &sect; 1983 liability where that private defendant was alleged to have conspired with government officials to deprive another of federal rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court granted the landowner's motion to strike the company's special defenses.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to 8 years' incarceration and 10 years of parole. The kidnapping and risk of injury to a child convictions were reversed. Further appellate review was still pending, but defendant sought revision of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two incidents four days apart, defendant stopped his car and walked toward the same 12-year-old victim. In both incidents, defendant told the victim to get into his car. The first time, the victim ran away. In second time, forcibly grabbed the victim, although the victim was able to fight herself free. Defendant was age 40 and was in the National Guard at the time of the offense. His record indicated that he was a good soldier. Defense counsel argued that the charges were overreaching. The sentence review division found that the sentencing court relied heavily on the fact that the evidence produced at trial demonstrated that defendant had attempted to abduct the same girl twice in the same week. This is serious and dangerous behavior. Society needed to be protected from defendant, and in particular young children needed to be protected from defendant. This could have had a catastrophic ending. The victim and her family were very fortunate. Taking all of the evidence adduced at trial and considered by the trial court, the sentence was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The company moved for summary judgment, arguing that 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106 applied to shield it from liability and that it could not be held liable because the driver was not authorized to operate the car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A third party rented the car from the company. She did not list any other authorized drivers in her rental agreement, and she promised not to allow anyone else to operate the vehicle. The company contended that it could not be held liable for the acts of an unauthorized operator and that 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106 applied to protect it from being held vicariously liable for the accident. The court agreed that &sect; 30106 applied because the accident occurred after the statute's effective date, the company was engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles, and the passenger did not allege that the company had engaged in any negligent or wrongful conduct in connection with renting the car to the third party. Section 30106 precluded the passenger from holding the company liable under Connecticut law. The court rejected the passenger's claim that &sect; 30106 was unconstitutional. It disagreed with a New York court and a Florida federal district court, which had held otherwise. In addition, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a, the company could only be held liable for acts committed by authorized drivers. The driver was not an authorized operator of the car.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a town board of selectmen, appealed from a decision of defendant Freedom of Information Commission (FOIC), declaring null and void the acceptance of a resignation by defendant town employee, and directing the board to comply with the Freedom of Information Act. The FOIC found that the board had violated portions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-225(d), when the matter of the employee's resignation was addressed at an &quot;emergency meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the term &quot;emergency&quot; Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-225(d) was overly broad. There was no constitutional violation for vagueness merely because the general term &quot;emergency&quot; was used in a statute, and it was left to a hearing to gather the specifics of whether an emergency existed. Also, the record supported the FOIC's finding that the meeting was not based on an emergency. The employee's &quot;threat&quot; occurred in the context of an argument between two lifelong friends (the employee and one of the town selectmen), no police protection was called for either during the meeting or after, and the dispute had been sufficiently resolved at the conclusion of the meeting. There was no need to have a meeting before 24 hours elapsed and on a Saturday morning. Further, the record established that the call of the meeting, initially at least, was not a careful reaction to an emergency, but just a follow-up to the argument itself. Finally, the FOIC's decision to declare the action taken at a meeting null and void was not undercut merely because the agency did not impose that remedy in other cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the board's contentions were without merit and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Connecticut Judicial Branch, on its own initiative, announced a plan to review all files that were designated with a Level 2 sealing to determine: (1) whether the cases were properly designated as sealed; (2) whether the docket sheets could be displayed on the Connecticut Judicial Branch website; and (3) whether the motions and orders to seal the file could be made publicly available. Objectants filed objections to the disclosure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that it had continuing jurisdiction to hear the matter, even though more than four months had elapsed since the entry of judgment for purposes of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-212a. The trial court had inherent power over protective orders, and had supervisory power over its own files. A new practice book rule was not being retroactively applied as Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect;&sect; 25-59 and 25-59A only codified a constitutional process of weighing of the privacy interests against the First Amendment public right of access. The new rules did not create a new right in the public, nor did they dictate an outcome on the continued sealing of a file or any of its contents. A res judicata claim was rejected. Concerns about the parties' privacy interests were to be weighted in the constitutional analysis. Objectants did not show that Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 25-59A was unconstitutional. Section 25-59A provided notice provisions that were in furtherance of management of a case in which sealing was before the court. It then reiterated that which was already the law. It did not make substantive new law. A slippery slope argument was rejected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The docket sheet was to be disclosed. The motion to seal and the order granting it were ordered unsealed. The docket sheet that had been ordered to be disclosed would be available online, the decision and the motions and orders which had been ordered disclosed were to be available to the public at the courthouse. The memorandum of decision and orders were unsealed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought the variances under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6(a)(3) to allow him to build single-family houses on the properties. The reviewing court held that there were numerous reasons for the denial of the variances, including the proximity of the proposed homes to existing ones, property values, and the need for new roads. The owner's claim that the lots had been taxed as building lots was a claim of financial hardship that did not constitute undue hardship. The owner's claim that his failure to be able to build homes on the properties rendered them worthless did not constitute undue hardship as the properties retained their original values as side yards. The board did not act arbitrarily, illegally, or unreasonably in denying the variances. Finally, the denials of the variances were not unconstitutional takings. The government took nothing from the owner except a potential profit from the increase in value of the land if the variances were granted. The properties retained their original value, and no practical confiscation occurred. There were numerous considerations on the side of the community to balance against the potential loss to the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate's habeas corpus attorney admittedly failed to file a motion with the appellate court to pen the inmate's appeal after it was dismissed for failure to timely file an appellate brief. The attorney testified that said failure was due to personal and health issues. The court concluded that the inmate proved the first prong of the Strickland test--his counsel failed to file the appellate brief. There was no indication that the inmate waived his right to appeal and thus, that right was abridged by counsel's failure to file the appellate brief. The court further concluded that but for the attorney's failure to file an appellate brief, the appeal would have been considered on its merits. Thus, the inmate met the prejudice requirement and was entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acquittee was placed under the jurisdiction of a psychiatric security review board after he was acquitted of assault due to mental disease or defect. On remand from the Connecticut Supreme Court, the court considered the State's objection to acquittee's motion to dismiss the State's petition for continued confinement under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;17a-593(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties agreed that acquittee's motion to dismiss raised the same general constitutional challenge to &sect; 17a-593(c) as in his prior motion to dismiss. Acquittee claimed that the prior decision, though in a broad sense addressing the constitutionality of &sect; 17a-593(c), was based on a very narrow factual and procedural scenario that  precluded generalization of its holding and rationale to the wider range of claims that he now sought to advance. In the State's view, the change in the acquittee's basis of attacking the statute did not sufficiently differentiate his prior challenge from the current challenge. The superior court concluded that the procedural question could not be resolved in a summary fashion. The question could only be answered after the acquittee was afforded an opportunity to argue the merits of his current motion, delineate the precise factual and legal foundation for his claims, and attempt to distinguish those claims from the binding conclusions set forth in Long. With the relevant issues then clearly and squarely framed, a court could assess the merits of the objection and determine whether the principles of claim preclusion applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court overruled without prejudice the State's objection and its claim for summary relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff sperm donor applied for visitation and shared custody of the minor child of defendant mother. Defendant moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that plaintiff lacked standing, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 46b-56, 46b-61, which governed custody and visitation of a minor child, because he was only the sperm donor and not the child's natural parent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties alleged different agreements were made in advance of the donor procedure, none of which were reduced to writing. At the reproductive services center, plaintiff signed a waiver of his rights were a child to be conceived. Subsequent to the child's birth, the parties acknowledged paternity and plaintiff was listed on the birth certificate. Plaintiff refused to sign papers allowing for the adoption of the child by defendant's civil partner and litigation followed. The court reviewed other courts' decisions on similar matters finding that none of the cases was dispositive but the reasons in each were helpful. Connecticut's sperm donor statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-775, was ambiguous in the absence of definitions for the words &quot;known&quot; or &quot;identified&quot; sperm donor. The statute's purpose did not fit the case. Even if the statute were unambiguous, application would have violated plaintiff's due process rights. Based on the circumstances surrounding defendant's decision to be artificially inseminated by plaintiff's sperm, the parties' preconception intent, the evidence submitted and, in particular, the acknowledgment of paternity, plaintiff had standing to make his application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The federal statute applied to suits commenced after the statute's enactment date, August 20, 2005. The suit here was commenced in 2006. Plaintiff argued that the federal statute was an unconstitutional attempt by Congress to extend its Commerce Clause power into an area reserved to the states. The court rejected this argument. Unlike potential lost work days, which the United States Supreme Court had found to have only a tangential relationship to interstate commerce, the highly mobile business of leasing cars was clearly one that was fully intertwined with interstate commerce. Therefore, there was no merit to plaintiff's Commerce Clause argument. The federal statute preempted state law and applied to plaintiff's complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a licensed attorney in the State of Connecticut whose license to practice law was suspended before the complainant alleged that she hired defendant to process an immigration matter through the United States Custom and Immigration Service. Defendant's services included a consultation, the quotation of a fee and the provision of a letter outlining the terms of the representation. Defendant then allegedly altered checks or money orders provided by the complainant. The court found that the State of Connecticut had authority to prosecute defendant for practicing law in the federal arena because the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution did not prohibit the State from exercising such authority. However, the purpose of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-88 was to enforce the prohibition against the unauthorized practice of law by persons who had not been admitted as attorneys. Because defendant was admitted to the Connecticut bar, and his admission had not been revoked, he continued to be an attorney. As such, he was exempt from the statute.

DOC filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DOC asserted lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to sovereign immunity, defects in the service of process, and the employee's failure to exhaust administrative remedies with the CHRO. The court held that as DOC failed to raise the personal jurisdiction issue within 30 days, this defense was waived pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect;&sect; 10-30 and 10-32. The employee's breach of contract claim (count three) failed, as (1) he did not assert any statute by which the State waived sovereign immunity, and (2) the claims commissioner did not authorize him to sue the State for money damages. Count three lacked any allegations that, if proven, would support his allegation that DOC acted in excess of its statutory authority in breaching its employment contract with him. Count four (NIED) failed because (1) he named no individual defendants; (2) he identified no statute by which the State waived sovereign immunity; and (3) he did not claim a violation of constitutionally protected rights or that the State acted in excess of its statutory authority. As to count two, DOC submitted no affidavits to support its claim that the issue of retaliation was never raised before the CHRO.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenant sued defendants, a housing authority, its commissioners and executive director, a city, and the city's police chief and director of health. She claimed defendants engaged in negligent and unconstitutional conduct and violated their statutory duties with regard to providing safe and habitable low income housing. She moved for an order that the action proceed as a class action on behalf of all persons situated similarly to herself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff claimed to represent all tenants of the authority's apartment complex. She alleged defendants failed to provide habitable housing, in violation of state law. The first eight counts sought money damages for personal injuries. Her ninth count sought an injunction directing some defendants to provide housing as required by statute and the appointment of a receiver. The court held plaintiff satisfied the numerosity, commonality, and typicality factors of Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 9-7. Defendants agreed that counsel was competent, and, insofar as only injunctive relief for present tenants was sought, there was no direct conflict of interest. The conditions of the premises, the ability to move residents, and the legal questions were subject to generalized evidence. However, individualized evidence would be required to prove each class member's damages. Therefore, the court found that Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 9-8's predominance factor was satisfied as to injunctive relief, as requested in count nine, but not as to items of damage alleged in the first eight counts. And as to count nine, a class action was superior to other available remedies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court certified a class, limited to present tenants, as to count nine, seeking injunctive damages, but not as to the other counts for other types of claimed damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency invited proposals for the construction, management, and maintenance of an aviation-related facility.

The air services company submitted a bid and was then awarded the leasehold and development rights. However, the agency later terminated those rights without executing a final agreement. The air services company sued agency. On the agency's motion to dismiss, the trial court found that sovereign immunity barred the breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, and quantum meruit claims since those claims were against the state for money damages and the air services company did not overcome the presumption that sovereign immunity barred those action. It also found that fraud, constitutional, and antitrust claims were barred by sovereign immunity and no waiver of sovereign immunity was shown, and that no administrative appeal was involved because administrative remedies had not been exhausted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed an action by defendant Planning and Zoning Commission after their application was approved subject to conditions enumerated in a special permit. The property owners contended the conditions imposed were illegal and that they had a pre-existing non-conforming right to operate their business. They requested that the conditions be declared null and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed an application for a special permit for fill and excavation, including screening, stockpiling and sale of earth products for an earth material processing center and landscaping material storage. The property was located partially in an industrial zone and partially in a residential zone. They had acquired title to the property after the enactment of the zoning regulations. Prior to the enactment of the regulations, the property had been used for sand and gravel operations, which included the screening, storing, excavating, stockpiling and selling of earth products, which included the sale of landscaping material. The property owners continued the same operations after their acquisition of title. The court held that the action of the Commission acting in a legislative function in establishing the zoning designation for the property divided the use of each portion to be governed by the particular zone that it was located within. The requirement of a special permit did not apply to the pre-existing non-conforming portion designated as industrial. Thus, the Commission abused its discretion as an administrative zoning agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, developers and builders, filed an action against defendant town, alleging violations of assorted statutes, including the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110a et seq., arising from the town's collection of alleged excessive building permit fees (BPFs). Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect;&sect; 9-7 and 9-8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the town required them to obtain building permits in order to conduct their trades, and that the fees collected were in excess of the cost relating to the service provided, were used for the funding of unrelated social programs, and constituted an illegal taking without just compensation. The court initially noted that it would not review claims that were not raised in the amended pleading. Further, plaintiffs had standing to assert the CUTPA claims, as they directly paid the allegedly excessive BPFs, whether the cost thereof was passed on to others or not. Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect;&sect; 9-7 and 9-8, class certification was proper in the circumstances. There were over 1,000 members of the class for purposes of numerosity under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 9-7(1), there was a commonality of issues under &sect; 9-7(2), and the claim of excessive fees was typical of all putative class members under &sect; 9-7(3). The named plaintiffs were adequate representatives under &sect; 9-7(4), and the claims fell within the requirements for superiority and predominance pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 9-8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the motion for class certification. The court directed that the class was to consist of entities that directly paid to the town the allegedly excessive BPFs during a set period of time.</SPAN></P>

The parents sought to permanently enjoin defendants from operating the funding system and order them to create a public education system that would provide suitable educational opportunities for all children. The court could not find in the text of Conn. Const. art. 8, &sect; 1, and Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 1 and 20, the decisions of the Connecticut Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court, the history and context of the constitutional guarantee of free public elementary and secondary schools, or appropriate economic, cultural, or public policy considerations any basis for concluding that there existed a constitutional right to &quot;suitable&quot; educational opportunities. The counts of the complaint which were premised on the existence of a constitutional right to a &quot;suitable&quot; education did not state a claim on which the court could grant relief and had to be stricken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission did not contest plaintiff's right to make copies of the record but argued it had to be done at her own expense. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(i), which required a zoning authority to transmit the record to the court, was silent as to whether the record had to be served on the other party to the action. The court noted that the rules for the Connecticut superior courts applied to administrative appeals, because they were &quot;civil actions.&quot; Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 7-6 required a certificate of service on all documents filed with the court, and Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super.

Stat. &sect; 8-8(i) did not indicate that filing the record with the court was intended to be the only requirement placed on zoning authorities regarding service, or that the courts' normal procedural rules as to service were not to be operative.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff police lieutenant sought relief against defendants, a town, a police captain, a chief, and the town's former human resources director, after having been passed over for promotion to a position of captain. In a five-count amended complaint he sought injunctive relief and damages for breach of contract and promissory estoppel, enforcement of writs of mandamus and quo warranto, and relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that an injunction was appropriate, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-471, as the town and its personnel had by their actions in passing over the lieutenant demonstrated that absent some stay or other injunctive relief, they were likely to continue to cause harm to the lieutenant and others in the police department similarly situated. Such harm would be irreparable, and the lieutenant was likely to prevail on appeal. Under the circumstances, the lieutenant's expectation of promotion based upon his rank on a promotion list rose to the level of a constitutionally protected property interest under &sect; 1983. In considering the lieutenant's due process claim under &sect; 1983, the court found that the evidence clearly supported a finding that the town had a merit-based promotion program which was in part based upon the town charter; written rules, policies, and procedures; a written collective bargaining agreement; and in part upon a well-established past practice of promoting persons by rank order on the promotion list. Accordingly, defendants' failure to promote the lieutenant in accordance therewith was an unwarranted deprivation of his fundamental property rights without due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among other orders, judgment was entered in favor of the lieutenant on counts one, three, and four of the amended complaint, and for defendants on counts two and five. The captain was ordered to cease occupying the office of police captain in the police department. The lieutenant was promoted to occupy the office of captain, with seniority dating therefrom, together with all back pay, benefits, as well as prejudgment interest thereon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff abutting landowners appealed a decision of defendant town planning and zoning commission, in which the commission granted an application filed by defendant executrix of a decedent's estate to subdivide a parcel of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission approved five waivers of the town subdivision regulations in approving the application. The reviewing court held that the landowners were statutorily aggrieved. The appeal was timely and service was proper. The commission's decision was proper. The regulations specified adequately the conditions under which a waiver of the specific regulations would be granted, and Darien, Conn., Subdivision Regs. art. I, &sect; B set forth many criteria to be considered by the commission in evaluating whether to approve subdivision applications. Those criteria guided the commission and allowed those affected to know their rights. The landowners did not show that the subdivision regulations were vague and invalid. The commission could waive the requirement contained in Darien, Conn., Subdivision Regs. art. IV, &sect; E9.  Both parties offered a plausible definition for the word &quot;certain&quot; in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-26. Requiring the commission to single out each requirement that was subject to waiver would not facilitate the commission's operational function. Finally, the claim that a commission member's wife spoke on behalf of her husband was rejected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, plaintiffs, candidates for local office and their petition circulators, challenged the rejection pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-410 of certain nominating petitions by defendants, the Democratic registrar of voters and a city clerk. Plaintiffs, inter alia, asserted that &sect; 9-410 was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated the First Amendment as well as Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 4, 5, 10, 14.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitions were rejected because the circulators had circulated nominating petitions for more than one candidate for the same office. The court ruled in favor of defendants, holding that 1) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-410(c) was violated regardless of the fact that the circulators did not circulate petitions for more than one candidate simultaneously; 2) the fact that one of the candidates was acting as a placeholder candidate and that he intended to withdraw after the ballot was set had no bearing on the application of &sect; 9-410(c) as he was a &quot;candidate&quot; at the times relevant to the case; 3) &sect; 9-410(c) was not void for vagueness as it provided clear boundaries regarding the circulation of nominating petitions for two candidates for the same office; and 4) &sect; 9-410(c)'s limitations on petition circulators placed only a slight burden on a circulator's right of association and free speech and the state interest in discouraging unfair tactics and the sponsoring of weaker rival candidates for strategic reasons justified that slight restriction. Section 9-401(c) did not violate either the U.S or state constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an inmate, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his convictions of murder and commission of a felony with a firearm.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that his trial counsel was ineffective because she failed to have the inmate testify at the suppression hearing, offer an alibi defense, and for other actions. The court held that the Sixth Amendment guaranteed reasonable competence, not perfect advocacy judged with the benefit of hindsight. The court found the inmate's claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to have the inmate testify at a suppression hearing to be without merit. The inmate's claim that he signed a blank sheet of paper, and that the police later filled in the confession, was not credible, as the inmate also initialled several strikeouts throughout the document. The court further found that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to present an alibi defense. There was no credible support for an alibi other than testimony by the inmate and his brother, and there was no reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the alimony testimony been presented. Given the state of the evidence presented at the habeas trial, there simply was no basis upon which the court could conclude that there was any unreliability in the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested on criminal charges and was arraigned. For five months, his case was the subject of multiple judicial pretrials. The case was then placed on the firm jury list, where it remained for a year until he filed a motion to dismiss alleging that his speedy trial rights had been violated. During the entire pendency of the matter, defendant was incarcerated in lieu of bond. The trial court then held a hearing on the motion. Defendant suggested in the motion that state statutes dealing with speedy trials, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 54-82m and 54-142a(c), were unconstitutional because they set forth specific time limits whereas the Sixth Amendment speedy trial right contained no specific time limit. The trial court rejected his argument because it found that the states were free to prescribe a reasonable period consistent with constitutional standards. The trial court then applied the four-part Barker test to determine whether defendant's speedy trial rights had been violated and, accordingly, considered length of delay, the reason for the delay, his assertion of the right, and prejudice to defendant. It then determined that his speedy trial rights had not been violated.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that petitioner had not sought to withdraw his plea and had not sought permission to file an untimely appeal. Thus, procedural default applied to this claim. Petitioner had not shown that ineffective assistance of counsel was the cause and prejudice, as it was uncontroverted that he wanted to plead guilty and that he had received the agreed-upon sentence. Petitioner's next claim, that the State had violated the plea agreement, thereby violating due process, was not only procedurally defaulted, but without merit. He had not proven that there was an agreement as to presentence confinement credit. Next, the court had no authority to award petitioner a credit under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-98d(a)(2)(A). Petitioner had not requested such a credit in the trial court or alleged that the failure to make such a request was ineffective assistance of counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing officer with defendant, the State of Connecticut Department of Children and Families (Department), held in a final decision that a child abuse incident involving plaintiff, a former shift supervisor at the New Haven Detention Center (employee), required the employee's name to be placed on the child abuse registry list was substantiated, the employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee contended that: (1) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-101k, as amended by the registry list provision, was unconstitutionally vague, represented an overly-broad delegation to the Department by the legislature, and constituted a bill of attainder; (2) the substantiation of physical abuse was not supported by substantial evidence; and, (3) the act of placing his name on the registry list was not supported by substantial evidence. As to the first two claims, the court disagreed. First, the statute met constitutional standards. Similarly, the Connecticut legislature, setting forth its concern for children at risk, did not violate the separation of powers doctrine in enacting &sect; 17a-101k. Third, the statute was one of general application which happened to have an adverse impact on the employee. Hence, the statute did not amount to a bill of attainder. As to the employee's second claim, the employee's actions likely resulted in the child being injured, and his act of using one child to discipline another was an intentional or grossly negligent act. But, it was apparent that the finding of chronicity was unsupported by the evidence. Hence, remand as to this issue was ordered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because support for the hearing officer's finding as to the specific &quot;chronicity&quot; factor of the employee's using a child, more than once, to intimidate another was not reflected in the record, the matter was remanded to the Department for further consideration of whether the employee's name should appear on the registry list. But, in all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The police from a Connecticut city went to New York and spoke to defendant. The Connecticut officer then took custody of defendant and transported him to Connecticut, where he was again interviewed. Defendant contended that the statements he allegedly made in New York and Connecticut should have been suppressed because they were obtained without an adequate advisement and waiver of Miranda rights, and the police officers had no extra-jurisdictional authority to conduct custodial interrogations in New York. Among other things, the court concluded that defendant was advised of his Miranda rights in New York, and knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights; there was no evidence that defendant's decision was anything other than the result of his free, considered, and unconstrained choice. The court also found that defendant was given his Miranda rights again in Connecticut and again voluntarily waived those rights. Contrary to defendant's contention, defendant had no Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the extradition hearing, as such a right would only have attached at the time of arraignment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the time of the crimes in question, petitioner had been involved in several incidents with the victim where he was the aggressor. Most of the incidents had been reported to the police and later prosecuted, but there had been one incident, revealed in a conversation between the victim and the prosecutor, that was never reported to the police. The prosecutor did not reveal this incident to petitioner's defense counsel or mention it at trial or at sentencing. Petitioner claimed that this incident was exculpatory. The court stated that for there to be a Brady violation, the undisclosed evidence had to be exculpatory. Here, there was no basis upon which the court could conclude that the undisclosed material was exculpatory; the most logical interpretation of the material was that it was inculpatory. Accordingly, there had been no Brady violation. Furthermore, there was no basis on which the court could conclude that there was any unreliability in petitioner's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The cyclist's complaint alleged negligence and recklessness against both defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the accident, the lessee was driving a vehicle he had leased from the owner. The owner based its motion for summary judgment on 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106 and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a(b). The court granted the motion. As of August 10, 2005, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106 preempted Connecticut law regarding the vicarious liability of the owner of a leased vehicle. Under &sect; 30106, the owner was not liable for personal or property damage arising from the operation of its vehicle so long as it was in the business of leasing motor vehicles, there was no negligence on the owner's part, and there was no criminal wrongdoing on the owner's part. There was no dispute that the owner was in the business of leasing vehicles and there were no allegations of negligence or criminal wrongdoing by the owner itself. Further, even if &sect; 30106 did not apply, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a(b) precluded any recovery against the owner because the driver had leased the vehicle for more than one year and had insured the vehicle for bodily injury liability in the amount of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Zoning Board denied plaintiff property owner's request for a variance. The property owner appealed claiming the Board's decision was illegal, arbitrary, and in abuse of discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner noted that the Board took the position that the property was not part of any approved subdivision and that only a four-lot subdivision was approved with the subject property being entitled as &quot;remaining land.&quot; The court held that, if that was true, then Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-26a(b) did not apply. The subject lot was never an approved buildable lot. The zoning commission could not have approved the property as a buildable lot given the important state policy regarding inland wetlands and watercourses. Nothing as to value was presented before the Board. It was difficult for the court to conclude the property was worthless or of no value because of the enactment of the regulations and the failure to grant the variance. The property owner knew or should have known of the Inland Wetland problem when the property was acquired. The town had an interest in making zoning changes it deemed necessary for health and safety and for protecting the environment. The property owner did not meet her burden of proving the variance she sought would not substantially affect the comprehensive plan.</SPAN></P>

Because plaintiff failed to allege specific negligence on the lessor's part, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a was preempted by 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106. The court also concluded that &sect; 30106 was not unconstitutional as it applied to Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Most of defendant's grounds had been rejected by either the U.S. Supreme Court in the Walton v. Arizona decision or by the state supreme court in the Rizzo and Ross decisions. The argument that the statute violated the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments because it gave prosecutors unfettered discretion to seek or decline to seek a death sentence had been rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in Gregg v. Georgia. Defendant's Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 9, claim on that point failed because the state supreme court had upheld the constitutionality of several death sentences resulting from the very prosecutorial discretion of which defendant complained. The fact that the statute placed the burden of proving mitigating circumstances on defendant was not a violation of his rights. Finally, the claim that race had an arbitrary, capricious, impermissibly discriminatory and disproportionate effect on capital sentencing both in Connecticut and elsewhere, in violation of both the federal and state constitutions, was a claim that had to be presented in a habeas corpus proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Third-party defendant, an organic cooking oil manufacturer, filed a motion to dismiss the third-party complaint filed by third-party plaintiff baking company. The baking company asserted that the manufacturer provided it with defective organic canola oil, which the baking company used in cookies and crackers it produced for plaintiff company. Plaintiff filed suit against the baking company alleging the cookies and crackers were defective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer asserted that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over it under the long-arm statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 33-929(f). The court agreed. The clear language of the statute stated that a foreign corporation could be sued in Connecticut only by a resident of the state or by a person having a usual place of business in the state. The baking company was not a resident of the state and did not have a usual place of business in the state. Further, there was no evidence that the manufacturer had minimum contacts with the state. The mere fact that it placed organic canola oil into the stream of commerce did not create such contacts. The baking company's claim that &sect;&nbsp;33-929 was unconstitutional was rejected as the baking company failed to offer proof of unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. Contrary to the baking company's claim, if any tortious act was committed by the manufacturer, it was committed in California, not Connecticut. Finally, under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, the proper venue for resolution of the third-party dispute was California, the home state of the two entities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff hospital filed an action against defendants, a patient and his wife, to recover for unpaid hospital bills. The wife filed a motion to strike the second count of the complaint on the ground that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-37, which made married couples responsible for each other's hospital expenses, violated the equal protection clauses of the federal constitution and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first rejected the wife's argument that the statute treated married couples differently from similarly situated civil union partners. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-38oo indicated that when statutes used a term denoting a spousal relationship, a party to a civil union should be included in such use or definition. Therefore, under &sect; 46b-38oo, a civil union partner could be substituted in &sect; 46b-37 in place of either &quot;husband&quot; or &quot;wife&quot;; thus, the statute applied to civil union couples as well as married couples, and there was no equal protection violation. The court next rejected the wife's argument that the statute imposed an unfair burden on a person's right to marry by not imposing a similar burden upon unmarried individuals. Connecticut did not recognize the validity of nonmarital relationships between heterosexual couples. As such, the participants in such relationships were not similarly situated to the participants in traditional opposite sex marriages. As there was no equality of status between the two groups of individuals, equal protection was not implicated by the requirement that married spouses be responsible for each other's hospital expenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to strike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the minority leader of a city board of aldermen, brought an action in quo warranto under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-491 and for mandamus against defendants, the city's mayor and various board and commission members. Plaintiff claimed that the members were not properly appointed to their positions and that the mayor made the appointments in disregard of Waterbury, Conn., Charter ch. 4, &sect; 4-2(b)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a member of the Independent party, in his capacity as minority leader submitted a list of individuals to the Democratic mayor for appointments to boards and commissions; however, the mayor submitted his own list to the board of aldermen. Plaintiff claimed that the mayor had to follow plaintiff's list of recommendations. While defendant argued that the mayor was constrained by plaintiff's list only if he wished to appoint someone who belonged to the same political party as plaintiff, the court held that the addition of the word &quot;party&quot; to &sect; 4-2(b)(1) in a 2002 charter revision was to prevent the mayor from appointing the maximum number of people from the mayor's own political party and then appointing additional people belonging to a different political party than that of the minority leader. Thus, three board members had to be ousted. However, two commission members were not ousted as &sect; 4-2(b)(1) did not apply to the finance and audit review commission under Waterbury, Conn., Charter ch. 6, &sect; 6B-1(b) as no more than three members of the seven-member commission could be from the same political party and also did not apply to the civil service commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ousted three board members as they were minority party members and did not appear on plaintiff's list of recommendations. However, two commission members were not ousted as Waterbury, Conn., Charter ch. 4, &sect; 4-2(b)(1) did not apply to the commissions on which they served. The court also granted the writ of mandamus and directed the mayor to make board and commission appointments as required by &sect; 4-2(b)(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiff's vehicle and a vehicle operated by the lessee collided. At the time of the accident, the lessee was operating a private passenger motor vehicle owned, and leased to him, by the lessor. The lessor argued that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because, as an owner of a vehicle leased for a term of more than one year and insured for bodily injury liability in the amount of $ 100,000 per person and $ 300,000 per accident, it was exempted from liability under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-154a(b)(1). In support of its motion, the lessor submitted a signed and sworn affidavit of its assistant vice president accompanied by a copy of the lease agreement between the lessor and the lessee. The court found that the affidavit with an attached copy of the lease agreement, submitted by the lessor in support of its motion for summery judgment, was sufficient to establish that the lease term was for more than one year and that the leased vehicle was insured for bodily injury liability in amounts of not less than $ 100,000 per person and $ 300,000 per occurrence.

</DIV>

Acts 241 and 2005 Conn. Acts 200 (now at Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;7-294aa).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The FPO requested a leave of absence from the board in order to serve as a civilian police officer in Iraq. Although the board denied the request and denied reconsideration thereof, the FPO informed the board of his intention to take early retirement in order to serve in Iraq. After his retirement, the FPO was appointed as a supernumerary police officer. Upon his return, his request for reinstatement was not acted upon, and he sought judicial relief. The court held that the board was the proper municipal entity to request reinstatement from, as it was responsible for all appointments to the town police department. The court found that the duty imposed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;7-294aa was mandatory, and that it applied to the FPO based on the date that he left his employment with the police department and despite the fact that he received payment for his work in Iraq. Although he took retirement rather than having resigned from his police position, &sect;&nbsp;7-294aa was applicable to him. The court found that &sect; 7-294aa withstood challenge under Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1, and that the FPO was entitled to reinstatement to his position on the day before he took retirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the FPO's requested relief and ordered the board to reinstate him to his former position.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor of the rental automobile contended that the Graves Amendment, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 30106, barred vicarious liability of an owner engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles in the absence of negligence or criminal wrongdoing. The accident victim countered that the Graves Amendment violated the Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8. The court found that the accident victim did not sustain the burden of proving that the federal statute was unconstitutional. The accident victim alleged that the motor vehicle driven by the operator was a rental automobile, while the lessor of the rental automobile submitted a copy of the rental agreement evidencing its engagement in the business of renting motor vehicles. The accident victim did not plead any negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the lessor of the rental automobile.

He was convicted of intentional manslaughter under accessory liability as lesser offenses, carrying a pistol without a permit, and commission of a felony with a firearm, in violation of Conn. Gen.

Stat. &sect;&nbsp;53-202k was vacated. In a prior habeas corpus petition, all claims were denied except as to sentence review, which was restored. However, review thereof resulted in a sentence affirmance. The inmate filed another habeas petition, and dismissal was sought as to ineffective assistance of trial counsel and cumulative error claims. The court found that there was no factual basis for the ineffective assistance claim based on an improper information, and the claim regarding expert testimony was barred by res judicata. There was no relief available for a cumulative error claim based on unspecified allegations against the prosecutor. The affirmative defense of procedural default was inapplicable to the claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and actual innocence.

Stat. &sect; 46b-57, to intervene in a custody matter and to apply for court-ordered visitation with the minor child. Plaintiff mother, who had sole custody of the child, filed a motion to dismiss those motions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant father's visitation rights had been suspended. However, prior to the suspension, the moving parties had been involved with the child during the father's visitations. They alleged that the father believed their continued visitation was in the child's best interest and that their relationships with the child were close. The court granted the motion to dismiss. Parenting was a fundamental right. Under Roth, basic constitutional protections required that any request for visitation contain factual allegations supporting contentions that a petitioner had a parent-like relationship with a child and that denial of the requested visitation would cause harm to the child parallel to the harm and damage contemplated by the Connecticut neglect and abuse statutes. The best interests of the child was not a standard for judicial consideration. None of the moving parties' pleadings set forth the required jurisdictional allegations. Also, while the memorandum in support of the motions purported to support claims of a &quot;parent like&quot; relationship and harm to the minor child, the facts provided did not suffice to establish a basis for either of the requirements dictated by Roth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's motion to dismiss was granted, and consequently, the motions to intervene and for visitation were dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the summons did not refer to the employees' job titles, but listed their addresses as &quot;c/o Office of the (Connecticut) Attorney General.&quot; Each employee was a state employee. The suit concerned their representation of the State. The State was the real party in interest. Any finding against the employees would effect DCF's procedures. Thus, the employees were sued only in their official capacities. The monetary claims were barred by sovereign immunity as it had not been waived, and the parents did not receive permission to bring their claims. The injunctive relief claims were barred as the allegations did not support the claim that the employees' actions exceeded their authority. The employees were not shielded from liability for money damages for the &sect; 1983 claims. Under federal law, it was possible to read the complaint as seeking monetary damages against the employees as individuals. Finally, the injunctive relief claim under &sect; 1983 was barred as only the State could provide the relief sought: that DCF expunge its records.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children argued that their visitation with the mother should continue. The trial court held that the attorney for the children did not allege any special need, reason, or circumstance that would require a continuation of visitation. Further, there was not an automatic stay of the termination of parental rights decision as there was a clear policy determination that the status quo was not automatically expected to remain in place pending any appeal. The motions to stay filed by the mother and the children had been denied. Even assuming that the children could utilize Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-59 as a basis on which to seek continuation of visitation with their mother, any visitation order entered after the termination of the mother's parental rights would be inconsistent with such termination. The purpose of a termination of parental rights was to vest legal authority over the children with the statutory parent or the guardians and to grant such entities or individuals the right to make decisions about the children's future life and their contact with others.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court ultimately upheld the denial of her workers' compensation claim because she had not given timely written notice of it. The attorneys and law firm proposed to her that the attorneys and law firm get legislation passed that would assist her. The attorneys and law firm got the legislation passed. Her claim was opposed on several grounds, including the contention that the legislation was unconstitutional because it appeared to only benefit the claimant. The attorneys and law firm filed a motion to enforce the purported settlement agreement. The trial court denied the motion upon concluding that the supposed agreement was not clear and unambiguous because the attorneys and law firm believed that it went into effect when she was allowed to file her claim, but she contended that she had to obtain a hearing on the merits.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs brought an administrative appeal. The authority moved to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The authority argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because there was no statutory right to appeal from a decision by the authority to amend its regulations. The right to take an appeal from Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-247 actions by a water pollution control authority only applied to certain actions under that statute. The court found that the authority's decision to amend its regulations did not fall within any of the categories for which an appeal could have been brought under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-246a. Plaintiffs, in their opposition to the motion, catalogued their grievances against the process surrounding their feasibility plan for the construction of a sanitary sewage system. Monies were spent on the supposition that the project would have been approved based on what were claimed to be misleading actions by the authority. By adopting the regulation, there was a functional equivalent of a denial of the application. Therefore, an unconstitutional taking was perpetrated. However, assuming all of this was true, no appeal was statutorily provided from the authority's action in amending its regulations so the court had no jurisdiction to hear the purported appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a review of the facts, the court noted that presumptively, the commissioner was protected under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The pedestrian was thus required to show that the commissioner had a duty to keep the driveway she was injured on in repair, but she failed to do so. Despite this, she argued that the commissioner was subject to suit under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-144 because the Department of Transportation (DOT) was maintaining the driveway. But, she cited no authority for the proposition that an agreement with a private entity could create a duty sufficient to trigger &sect; 13a-144. Further, a DOT district maintenance director stated that the driveway was not part of the state highway system. Moreover, because &sect; 13a-144 was an exception to sovereign immunity and was to be construed strictly in favor of the state, the fact that the DOT agreed to maintain a privately-owned driveway did not create a legal duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner filed an administrative appeal under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-43 against defendants, the East Lyme Conservation Commission (Connecticut), the Town of East Lyme, and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, after the Commission denied plaintiff's application to conduct regulated activities on a residential lot containing wetlands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that the Commission's denial of the application was not capricious, unreasonable, and inconsistent with the regulations. The denial was, however, an unlawful taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I. The record supported the Commission's finding that no feasible and prudent alternative existed that would allow plaintiff to construct a building on his lot, and the Commission's denial of the application established the requisite finality to assert a takings claim. Plaintiff had a reasonable investment-backed expectation of development for this property. He had bought other wetland lots and developed them; the lot here was zoned for a residential lot; and houses had been built on smaller lots within the same neighborhood. There had been a practical confiscation of the land because it could be used only in its natural state. The Commission's decision also resulted in a taking under the balancing test. The wetlands here were of poor to fair quality, and surrounding properties were already developed. Thus, the public benefit was not strong enough to outweigh the harm to plaintiff that would result from the denial of the application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the appeal. Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-43a(a), it remanded the application to the Commission for it to approve the application with such conditions as it found reasonably necessary to protect the wetlands on and adjacent to the site.</SPAN></P>

The lessee and the driver conceded that they were not seeking liability from the state insurance department. The lessee and the driver admitted there was no real controversy or adversity between them and the state insurance department. The only reason for involving the state insurance department was to explain why none of its employees had not supported the lessee and the driver in their claims against the insurer. This was not a basis for a claim. Even assuming that the matter was justiciable, the claim was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The lessee and the driver neither alleged nor argued that the legislature statutorily waived sovereign immunity, and failed to allege or argue that the state insurance department acted in excess of statutory authority, or pursuant to an unconstitutional statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Union requested the court to find that the Board, sitting as the arbitrator of the labor relations dispute, pursuant to the Act, issued the award in violation of Conn.

The court determined that the Union failed to meet its burden to show that there was any basis for vacating the award since the Union received proper notice of the issues as well as was provided multiple opportunities to present evidence in opposition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During most of the taxable years at issue, the taxpayer was a full-time salaried employee until he retired towards the end of the second taxable year at issue.

The taxpayer claimed to be a professional gambler, that is, a person who was in the trade or business of gambling, and so indicated on the federal tax forms he filed during the taxable years at issue. However, during the first taxable year he only played the slot machines for a total of 43 days; for the second taxable year, he only played the slot machines for a total of 22 days. On his state income tax forms for the two taxable years at issue, he reported his federal adjusted gross income for each respective year. The commissioner disallowed the taxpayer's deduction of gambling losses against gambling winnings for the two taxable years at issue, and imposed additional income tax assessments against him for each of those years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The country club and sole stockholder believed that there existed a policy of the city and its police department to harass the operation of the country club and to drive it out of business. To pursue that policy, they believed, the city, police chief, and two police officers either engaged in or allowed excessive or harassing police enforcement activity, as well as institution of a public nuisance action. The country club and sole stockholder filed a revised complaint. They alleged actions pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 that asserted their federal free speech and assembly rights, and their equal protection rights had been violated, that the conduct intentionally inflicted emotional distress on the sole stockholder, that an abuse of process was committed, and that negligent acts were performed. The city, police chief, and two police officers moved for summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In November 2000, the student went to the resource officer, stating that a person later identified as the teacher had been stalking and threatening her. The same allegation was made to the other officer. The teacher was arrested, however, all of the charges against him were dismissed in July 2002. The teacher filed suit in April 2005. The officers argued that they were entitled to summary judgment because the statute of limitations had run. The court agreed. In addition to is malicious prosecution claim, the teacher claimed a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights via a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action. The general tort statute of limitations found at Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-277 applied to both actions. Contrary to the teacher's assertion, the three-year statute of limitations began to run on the date that the last acts committed by the officers concerning the teacher's arrest were completed and not on the date that the criminal prosecution ended in his favor. The last actions by the officers occurred in November 2000. Thus, the teacher's April 2005 action against them was untimely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The state prisoner claimed that the alleged conduct violated his rights under state and federal constitutional law, and state statutes. The trial court granted the government representatives' motion to dismiss. It found that the government representatives in their individual capacities had not been served with process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was suspended as a result of stalking, intimidation, and threatening of a female student. The court concluded that both the notice and hearing procedures employed by the university with respect to the suspension satisfied the minimum requirements of procedural due process and that the student failed to show that he was substantially prejudiced by these procedures. The university sent the student a letter notifying him of the date of the hearing. The student never complained at the hearing that evidence of multiple incidents concerning the female student was a surprise or caused him to be unprepared to defend himself. The court found that the student knew what claims had been made against him by virtue of two letters and a conference with a university official. The court further held that the admission of hearsay evidence at the hearing did not constitute a violation of due process, as due process did not require that a student at a disciplinary hearing be afforded a right to cross-examine witnesses or compel testimony. The court further held that evidence of earlier incidents was properly admitted to add context and for the purpose of assessing adequate sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first held that the ordinance did not conflict with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-148(c). The legislature had purposefully used broad and general terms to allow municipalities to address safety, health, morals, and general welfare issues. The ordinance did not conflict with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-57. The city had not adopted the provisions of the statute; furthermore, the ordinance did not conflict with the statute, but complemented it. The ordinance did not violate procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment or Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Even if there was a property interest in certificates of occupancy and other permits, the ordinance contained an appeals provision. The ordinance did not violate substantive due process. Plaintiff had not shown that the regulations were unreasonable. As for equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 20, exempting certain properties allowed the city to allocate its limited resources to property most likely to be susceptible to health, safety and building violations.

Because the decedent's constitutionally protected rights were not violated, in that he was not treated with deliberate indifference to his health and safety needs, thee defendants who did not directly deal with him were not subject to supervisory or policy-making liability under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, primarily on grounds of sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff in her first count alleged that she had been treated as a temporary employee in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5-196, 5-236, and 5-239. The court stated that by codifying the State's obligations to its employees under these statutes, the legislature had waived sovereign immunity, at least by necessary implication. Furthermore, plaintiff's allegation that defendant had violated these statutes necessarily implied that the State had acted in excess of its statutory authority. As for the second count, alleging employment discrimination in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-60, the State was an employer under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-51(10). Sovereign immunity did not apply. Furthermore, plaintiff had exhausted her administrative remedies under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-100. The court also declined to dismiss plaintiff's punitive damages claim, as the language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-104 was sufficiently broad to include punitive damages. Finally, in plaintiff's contract claims, she sought reinstatement, which the court construed as seeking injunctive relief. The State could not use sovereign immunity as a defense in an action for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the Commissioner had authority to grant permission to sue only for simple negligence and that the legislature could not do more than that. The trial court held that as the Commissioner had authority to grant permission to sue for intentional torts and suits alleging negligence, the Commissioner could grant permission to sue for conduct that fell in between. Thus, the Commissioner could grant permission to sue for willful and malicious actions. The legislature had the same authority to grant permission to sue as did the Commissioner, and the resolution authorized the hikers to raise the willfulness claims that they presented to the Commissioner. The State could raise recreational use immunity if a private person could do so. Further, if the actions of any state employee were willful and malicious so as to constitute acts beyond the scope of their employment, the State would not be liable under respondeat superior. The hikers alleged willful and malicious behavior and negligence in their claims, but did not mention nuisance. As neither the claims nor the resolution mentioned nuisance, the legislature did not waive sovereign immunity for the nuisance claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motions to dismiss were granted with respect to the nuisance claims. The motions to dismiss were denied in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 4-175 and Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 17-54 against defendant, the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles, seeking a determination that the manner in which the Department implemented motor vehicle operators' license suspensions under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-227a and 14-227b which arose from the same incident was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a. Due to a finding that the motorist had refused to submit to a blood alcohol test, his license was administratively suspended for a period of time pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b(i). After that suspension was fully served, the motorist was convicted of a criminal offense arising from the same incident. The Department imposed a criminal license suspension under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;14-227a(g). The Department refused the motorist's request for &quot;credit&quot; for the administrative suspension period. On review of the motorist's claims, the court found that the motorist was not similarly situated to motorists who were serving one suspension when the other was imposed. Accordingly, the equal protection argument under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 failed. The motorist's due process claims under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 also failed, as he was given notice prior to the administrative suspension, and the criminal suspension was imposed in accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist's request for a declaratory judgment was denied, and the court entered judgment in favor of the Commissioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state supreme court 10 years earlier issued an opinion declaring that a school districting program as applied to the aggrieved parties violated their state constitutional rights by abridging their fundamental right to a substantially equal educational opportunity that was free from substantial racial and ethnic isolation. The trial court directed the legislative and executive branches to put the search for appropriate remedial measures at the top of their respective agendas. A few years later, the aggrieved parties sought further judicial assistance. The result was an agreement covering four school years, which set forth certain goals for improving the educational process. The agreement reached its last year, the goals were apparently not being met, and the parties were involved in further negotiations. The city moved to intervene. The trial court looked to the pleadings and accepted the allegations as true. It then found that the city had substantial interests in almost every aspect of the case and, as a result, it had to be made a party to the case.</SPAN></P>

Defendants filed a motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, who was serving a 60-year sentence for murder, argued that the Board, which had not stated a reason for denying his application for a pardon, was required to articulate the specific criteria for obtaining a pardon. He also claimed that the Board granted pardons disproportionately to white inmates. The court noted that the United States Supreme Court had stated that pardon and commutation decisions were rarely, if ever, appropriate subjects for judicial review. A decision whether to commute a long-term sentence depended not only on objective fact-finding, but on purely subjective evaluations and on predictions of future behavior. Plaintiff here sought information on how the Board operated in making pardon decisions and requested that the Board grant him a pardon. The court lacked the ability to substitute its judgment for that of the Board when it made decisions on whom might be granted a pardon. Accordingly, the action would be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The town inland wetlands commission vote to deny the application did not carry, and, thus, the application was effectively denied. The developer appealed and claimed that the town inland wetlands commission failed to state a reason for its denial and ignored expert evidence presented by the developer which indicated that the proposed construction would have no harmful effect on the existing wetlands. The trial court, in reviewing the record before it, concluded that the record as a whole adequately supported the town inland wetlands commission's action in ruling upon the application and, thus, found that the appeal had to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, an inmate, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that his conviction of robbery in the first degree and the resultant sentence was defective under both the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of Connecticut and that as a result he was entitled to have his convictions and sentence set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise a potential alibi defense at the inmate's trial. Given that the police did not recover the gun used in the robbery, the case hinged upon the identification of the inmate as the perpetrator by the victim. The inmate claimed that he was asleep in his apartment with his girlfriend at the time the robbery occurred. The court found that no evidence had been presented to undermine the credibility of the inmate or his girlfriend as to the claimed alibi. Given the significance of this potential alibi testimony and its propensity to induce reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury, the court found that the reliability of the inmate's conviction had been undermined and that the inmate thus satisfied the prejudice prong of the Strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that defense counsel clearly should have called the inmate and his girlfriend in order to establish an alibi defense that might well have led a jury to find reasonable doubt as to the inmate's guilt. The jury members were entitled to hear this testimony before they made the finding of guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was granted, the verdict was set aside, and the inmate was granted a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, petitioner prisoner, who was convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder, claimed that his court-appointed lawyer was ineffective so that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel and to due process of law. He argued, inter alia, that counsel did not object to his being tried in leg irons and did not file a petition for sentence review. The conviction had been affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim, who was a member of a gang, was shot by three men. The prisoner was the president of the gang. A witness was present at a meeting where two other gang members expressed anger to the prisoner. The prisoner, who was also angry at the victim, told the members to kill the victim. The prisoner confided to another witness that he was involved in the murder. The court held that defense counsel's actions were based quite properly on information supplied by the prisoner. There was no evidence presented that the prisoner ever informed his trial defense counsel that the victim was not a gang member. Thus, there was no reason for defense counsel to have asked the State's witnesses that question. Further, defense counsel made the strategic choice of attempting to convince the jury that the meeting had not taken place. The court found that under all the circumstances the prisoner failed to rebut the presumption that such action was sound trial strategy. There was no credible evidence presented that trial defense counsel could have done anything to have the shackles removed. However, the prisoner was denied his right to have his sentence reviewed by the Sentence Review Division.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All of the prisoner's claims under the writ of habeas corpus other than the claim regarding sentence review were dismissed. The prisoner was restored his right to apply for sentence review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's complaint was commenced on August 5, 2005, by service of process and alleged that on March 23, 2001, defendant's decedent negligently drove through a red light, striking plaintiff's vehicle in an intersection through which plaintiff was lawfully driving. As a result of the collision, plaintiff alleged that she sustained various injuries causing her pain and requiring medical care. Defendant's decedent died on March 14, 2003. In February 2004, the estate was opened. Plaintiff presented the estate attorney with written notification of her claim on February 4, 2004. Defendant filed its motion, claiming plaintiff did not file her claim within the applicable statute of limitations. Plaintiff relied on the notice to defendant's counsel apprising him of the claim and that the same was never rejected. The court examined the relevant statutes and held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-375(c) limited the time period for the tolling of a case to two years from the date of the decedent's death. Even viewing the facts in a light most favorable to plaintiff, her suit was still outside the provision of &sect; 45a-375(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainants sought certain records from plaintiff contractors, which had entered into agreements with the Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS) under the Freedom of Information Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-200 et seq. The Freedom of Information Commission (Connecticut) ordered DSS to obtain the records from the contractors and to provide them to the complainants. The contractors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under their agreements with DSS, the contractors provided health care to Medicaid and public assistance recipients. The contractors argued that the records were not subject to disclosure because they did not perform a governmental function under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-218. The court held that the contractors' managed care operations were &quot;programs&quot; of DSS under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-200(11). The division of care among the contractors was not a bar to each of their operations constituting a program. Furthermore, although some management decisions were left to DSS, the contractors retained authority over provider fees; thus, they made high-level decisions and &quot;administered or managed&quot; their operations. Because the establishment of provider fees, preferred drug lists, and prior approval lists involved a high level of decision-making by a contractor, those matters were subject to disclosure. Next, the court rejected the contractors' argument that in ordering amendments to their contracts with the DSS, the Commission had violated the Commerce Clause. There could be no violation of the Contracts Clause when a party had contracted to be bound by subsequent extracontractual decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prisoner was convicted in connection with the shooting of a grandmother and the killing of her seven-month-old granddaughter. The prisoner's convictions were upheld on appeal. The prisoner then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied. Subsequently, the prisoner filed a second petition for writ of habeas corpus. Respondent warden filed a return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition raised claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to his first habeas corpus petition, and &quot;actual innocence.&quot; The prisoner asserted that trial counsel was ineffective, inter alia, in failing to properly investigate certain fingerprint evidence. However, in rejecting that argument, the court held that it was sheer speculation that effective counsel could have used the prints. In addition, trial counsel was not ineffective in any other manner, including by his failure to object to an identification and his failure to object to comments by the prosecutor, which were not of such a nature as to have caused a denial of due process. Further, although the prisoner was entitled, pursuant to his right to file a habeas corpus proceeding under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-296, to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of habeas corpus counsel, his claim failed because the prisoner had failed, as a threshold matter, to show that his trial counsel's representation was ineffective. Further, the petition fell far short of the meeting the burden required to establish &quot;actual innocence&quot; as a basis for granting the writ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner claimed that a dock had previously existed on the property, establishing a pre-existing use. The court denied the appeal, finding that the owner improperly attempted to bring a declaratory judgment action with his statutory appeal under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-43. Further, there was strong evidence that the drafters of the ordinance intended that only those docks available for use on the ordinance's effective date were deemed authorized. There was no evidence that the owner's aluminum dock was installed on the effective date. Additionally, the court found that the due process and equal protection arguments were not fully briefed because they were unaccompanied either by legal analysis or citation to authority. No constitutional due process rights existed, and the only requirement in administrative proceedings was that the conduct of the hearing should not violate the fundamentals of natural justice. Finally, the court found that the decision of the IWWC was not clearly erroneous under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183(j). There was substantial evidence to show that the proposed dock would be a navigational hazard, impede navigation, or impede ingress and egress from the shore.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed a decision of defendant Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of Old Saybrook (Connecticut), in which the Board denied the owners' request for certain variances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners requested variances with respect to lot size and setback from side property lines. The reviewing court held that the owners were aggrieved. Service complied with the statutory prerequisites. The denial of the variances did not amount to a confiscation. The property had uses other than for a single family home. Ownership of the property entitled the owners to membership in a beach club and access to a beach area that the general public was prohibited from using. Many people had purchased permanently vacant lots for the sole purpose of gaining beach rights. Thus, the property had value to potential purchasers. Additionally, the property could be used as a side yard to one of the three adjoining lots. The owners purchased the property due to anticipated ownership of an adjoining lot. Although the owners never gained complete ownership of the adjoining lot, their initial interest in the property was indicative of potential value to other adjoining landowners. The owners also did not show that they would be unsuccessful in selling their property to an abutting landowner. The Board acted within its discretion and based on the evidence before it when it denied the variances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer sought a refund of sales taxes paid under the Lemon Law, which was disallowed based on the lack of statutory authority. An administrative appeal resulted in an affirmance of the disallowance, as the vehicle sales were completed transactions that were properly subjected to sales tax. The manufacturer sought judicial review, and the Commissioner sought dismissal of the action based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The manufacturer alleged that the Commissioner's failure to have asserted sovereign immunity as an affirmative defense pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect;&sect; 10-31 and 10-32 constituted a waiver thereof. The court initially noted that Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 10-33 was the appropriate rule regarding dismissal. The manufacturer was not a taxpayer under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-418, 12-421, and 12-425, as it did not pay the sales tax. Further, it was statutorily responsible for reimbursing the consumers for the tax and accordingly, there were no constitutional violations. As the State had not waived sovereign immunity and there were no constitutional violations, dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a limited liability company and the company's principal and sole member, appealed from the decision of defendant, the planning and zoning commission of a town, which denied an application to resubdivide a 13.6-acre lot that had been modified pursuant to a lot line revision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission denied the application on the ground that it failed to comply with the open space design provisions of the town subdivision regulations. Plaintiffs argued that the denial violated the commission's powers because each of the six proposed lots complied with the applicable subdivision regulations. Town of Coventry, Conn., Zoning Regs. 20.4(2) stated that an open space subdivision consisted of a parcel or parcels of land containing no less than a total of 15 contiguous acres. It was uncontested that the commission had approved a lot line revision on the property. Hence, under the modified subdivision plan, the lot in question was a 13.6-acre parcel. Thus, the court held that the lot in question did not meet the open space general eligibility requirements because substantial evidence in the record showed that the lot contained less than 15 contiguous acres. Because the record did not contain substantial evidence demonstrating that plaintiffs' application for resubdivision was subject to the open space design requirements, the court found that the reasons for the commission's denial were unreasonable, arbitrary, and illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was sustained, and the denial of the subdivision application was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was swearing in front of children at a wedding, throwing beer bottles at the wedding cake, and asking the children to follow him outside to take &quot;shots&quot; of alcohol. The children included a nine-year-old child (child). The trial court held that defendant was not the child's parent, guardian, or spouse. Published judicial opinions gave fair warning to defendant that his conduct was prohibited. The fact that the child did not accept the delivery of the alcoholic beverage from defendant did not distinguish prior cases. The intent for required under &sect; 53-21 was the general intent to do that which the law prohibited, or the intent to cause or permit a situation to arise that was likely to injure the health or impair the morals of a child under the age of 16. A specific intent to cause harm to the victim was not an element of the offense. While it was assumed that serving alcoholic beverages to a minor was customary in certain religious services, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 30-86(b), such service or delivery had to be made by a parent, guardian, or spouse of the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges against defendant arose from photographs and conduct he engaged in with his 12-year-old former sister-in-law. Defendant asserted that the seizure of a Hewlett Packard computer and various computer data storage devices from his apartment constituted a violation of his rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. After taking the seized items into custody and later viewing their contents, the police discovered over 200 images of the minor victim changing in and out of clothing and other child pornography images. The court held that the issuing judge was justified in concluding that there was probable cause to believe that the conduct of defendant was criminal in nature in that the affidavit indicated defendant created a situation in which a child was endangered and photographing a nude or seminude minor was a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21. Further, no staleness was found since the warrant affidavit supported a finding of an ongoing pattern of activity, and the fact that a Compaq computer was cited in the affidavit did not limit the search to only a computer by that name.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff environmental group filed an action against defendant electric utility. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-16 that defendant was violating the Connecticut Environmental Protection Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-14 et seq. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or to strike the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had previously captured and killed monk parakeets that nested on its utility lines and poles. Defendant had stopped doing this but had not implemented measures to stop the birds from building their nests. Because of this, plaintiff argued, defendant was likely to resume killing the birds. The referee rejected defendant's argument that the action was not ripe. The &quot;reasonably likely&quot; language in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-17 allowed plaintiffs to challenge future conduct. Plaintiff had alleged circumstances under which, given the past conduct of defendant, it was reasonable to conclude that defendant was likely to engage in similar conduct in the future. Thus, the referee denied the motion to dismiss. As for the motion to strike, plaintiff had not judicially admitted that killing the birds was allowed under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 26-92 by stating that the birds' future conduct was a &quot;potential public hazard.&quot; This was not an unequivocal statement that the birds constituted a public safety hazard. Finally, defendant had not shown that federal law would preempt Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-16, to the extent that the state law could be interpreted to prohibit the killing of monk parakeets.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mother filed a child support petition for a minor child. The trial court (Connecticut) granted the petition and a garnishment/wage withholding issued. The trial court granted a motion filed by defendant father, through the Connecticut Support Enforcement Division, to modify his child support order, and reduced the father's support obligation to zero. The child appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that he had no income due to his incarceration. The appellate court held that a deviation from the presumptive amount under the child guidelines was not warranted. The parent/child relationship did not factor significantly into the &quot;best interest&quot; analysis since the father's relationship with the child was likely to continue regardless of the disposition of the motion. Maintaining the support order was in the child's best interests. The father would owe approximately $ 13,400.00 after his incarceration, but he would be able to return to his former position as a union carpenter after he was released from prison in less than 11 months. Thus, a large, uncollectible arrearage would not accrue. The father testified that the child support arrearage would not interfere with his ability to see or have a relationship with his child. It was unlikely that the additional accrual of approximately $ 3,500.00 would result in a psychological hurdle of hopeless debt that would impede the parent/child relationship. As the statutory goals were not furthered and there were no equitable reasons that supported a reduction in the support order, equitable relief for the child was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This matter was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the State of Connecticut, filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff patient's action on the grounds of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and on the prior pending action (PPA) doctrine. The patient filed suit, alleging medical negligence, and battery and lack of informed consent, arising from his treatment by a physician employed at a health care facility operated by the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was treated by the physician for kidney problems, which included surgical intervention. Thereafter, he experienced blood in his urine for a period of years until it was discovered that laser fibers were left in his ureter. The patient underwent numerous surgeries to treat his condition, and he was granted permission to file suit against the State. Although initially dismissed as untimely, the patient obtained permission under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148(b) to resubmit the claim through 2005 Conn. Acts 05-4, &sect; 1 (Spec. Sess.). The State sought dismissal of the action. The court reviewed the analysis necessary to determine the constitutionality of a special act under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Analogizing the limitations period under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;4-148(a) to that of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-584, the court found that the patient's claim was untimely, as he should have discovered it when he was informed about the fibers and underwent surgery for their removal. There was no evidence that a state actor's procedural mistake precluded the timely filing of the complaint. Further, the special act did not serve a public purpose. Determination of the PPA doctrine was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that (1) defendant was alcohol and/or drug dependent at the time of the alleged offenses; (2) defendant, at the time of the evaluation, was in need of and would have benefit from treatment for his dependency; (3) defendant was receiving long-term inpatient residential substance abuse treatment, as a result of his sentence in a youthful offender case; (4) defendant successfully completed the inpatient program; and (5) defendant was no longer in need of inpatient treatment for his dependency but rather, was in need of aftercare relapse prevention which would have include approximately two hours per week. The court concluded that suspension of prosecution would not have advanced the interest of justice. The offenses which defendant allegedly committed were egregious and troubling, taking place while he was awaiting sentencing. Further, a seventeen-year-old girl was nearly killed by the alleged acts of defendant in procuring, preparing, and injecting a dose of heroin into her arm.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DCF filed motions to have disclosed to it the mother's alcohol and drug abuse treatment records and her mental health, therapy, and counseling records.

The mother asserted that the DCF's motion, by its own terms, sought records that were confidential based on state statutory privilege. The court found that given the type and number of the protections provided both by federal law relating to alcohol and drug abuse services and by state law for a variety of mental and physical health and related services, and given the carefully crafted and delineated federal and state law exceptions to disclosure of such confidential documents and information, neither the DCF nor anyone other than Congress or the General Assembly were authorized to create exceptions in addition to those specifically provided in federal and state law. Since the positions advanced by the DCF were not set forth as exceptions to disclosure in the applicable federal or state law or regulations, they were not available to the DCF as a basis for disclosure of the mother's legally protected confidential and privileged documents and information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parents sued defendants, a town, the town's board of education (board), and three school officials (defendants), alleging that their son was subject to severe bullying behavior within the school system and that the school officials refused to take meaningful action to redress the problem. Defendants moved to strike the parents' first and second counts of their amended complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents alleged in the first count that the defendants' actions denied their child equal educational opportunities. The defendants responded that such statement was conclusory and that the board was entitled to sovereign immunity because it was acting as an agency of the state. The instant court concluded that while there was a sufficient factual basis to support the claim, the board was immune, as the defendants were being sued in their capacity as agents of the State. As to the second count, in the absence of any applicable precedence directing a contrary outcome, the court found insufficient indicia that the legislature intended to create a private cause of action pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&nbsp;10-222d. Hence, the second count was also stricken. Finally, the manner which a school district established its educational system, and the manner in which it implemented its bullying policy, were discretionary and contingent upon a multitude of variables, too numerous to permit any court to fashion a simple enjoinder which would not unduly interfere with governmental function.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a judge died from a heart attack, the administratrix, inter alia, filed a workers' compensation claim against the State alleging that his condition was causally related to work-induced stress. The state supreme court decided that the judge was not an employee for purposes of entitlement to workers' compensation benefits. Thereafter, the legislature enacted 1994 Conn. Spec. Acts 13, &sect; 1, allowing the administratrix to file an untimely action against the State. The court found that the administratrix's action was untimely because she was forced to litigate her claim to benefits when the State appealed the workers' compensation award. However, the authorization in &sect; 1 conveyed a right to only the administratrix. It did not change the notice provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-148(a) and did not create relief from those requirements for others similarly aggrieved. There was no showing that the State had any action, involvement, or participation in the administratrix's failure to comply with the requirements in Chotkowski III. Consequently, because the act served no &quot;public purpose&quot; and was unconstitutional under Conn. Const. art. I, the State was entitled to summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner appealed the decision of defendant, a town planning and zoning commission, which denied plaintiff's application for a change of use. The form presented by plaintiff indicated that the use of the building at issue was a vacant barbershop and karate studio. The proposed use was to be a retail-adult book and video store with video preview booths.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission denied the change of use based on two reasons: video preview booths were not a permitted use and there was no suitable or adequate parking for a use which included 15 such booths. The court found that the first reason for the denial of plaintiff's application was illegal and arbitrary based on a proper construction of the town's own ordinances. The court noted that it was permitted to do nothing else but to try to give a neutral interpretation to the language of the town regulations, none of which were directed specifically at the type of adult entertainment use sought. Further, the court determined that the commission itself had not held that the operation of an adult book store was an unpermitted use. The court also found that the second reason for the denial failed to afford plaintiff fundamental fairness in the manner in which it was arrived at in that counsel for plaintiff was prepared to answer any questions regarding the parking issue, as would his engineer, but they were not given the opportunity by the commission.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the borrowers' application was, in fact, an application for protection from foreclosure pursuant to &sect; 49-31f. However, the borrowers failed to provide the court with any financial information as to earned income during the 12-month period preceding the foreclosure action or the two years preceding that 12-month period.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs worked for the Department of Transportation of the State of Connecticut in various positions and were working on a camera project together. One plaintiff had commented about an employee of Palestinian descent that he was engaged in blowing up cars. The employee complained and that plaintiff was reprimanded. Three months later, that plaintiff was removed from the camera project and claimed that his removal was as a result of the comment he made, which was protected by the first amendment. Another plaintiff had called the police when he discovered that a computer was missing and claimed that his call was speech that addressed a matter of public concern and was protected by the first amendment. The court found that the calling of the police was not speech that touched a matter of public concern. As to plaintiffs' equal protection claim counts, the court found that one plaintiff had shown genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether his comment about the other employee was being treated differently than others similarly situated but that the other two plaintiffs failed to show any genuine issue of material fact with regard to the police call.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee filed a five-count complaint against defendant State of Connecticut Judicial Department, his former employer. The Department filed a motion to dismiss the last four counts, which were for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of contractual rights, and wrongful discharge. The employee sought injunctive relief and damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first count, which the Department did not seek to dismiss, was for retaliatory termination pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-290a. The Department argued that the other counts were barred by sovereign immunity. The court stated that one claiming to fall within any of the exceptions to the bar of sovereign immunity had to clearly show that the exception applied. The employee here had not done so. He had not pointed to any statutory authority whereby the legislature had waived the State's sovereign immunity as to the claims in counts two through five, and he had not expressly claimed or clearly demonstrated an incursion upon constitutionally protected rights or claimed that the State acted in excess of its statutory authority. The only argument the employee had made was that his complaint could reasonably be construed as one against his supervisor individually. The supervisor, however, had not been named as a defendant or referred to as one. Accordingly, the court granted the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Connecticut filed a motion for the extension of the commitment of an acquittee who in 1985 had been placed under the jurisdiction of the Connecticut Psychiatric Security Review Board. The acquittee filed a motion to dismiss the commitment extension motion and a motion to strike the Board's report to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acquittee was committed in 1975 after he was acquitted on an assault charge by reason of mental disease or defect. The motion to strike the Board's report was rejected by the court. The court was required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(d) to obtain the Board's report making it admissible as evidence. Admission of the report did not violate due process as the acquittee had a full opportunity to be involved in the hearing the Board conducted prior to making the report. The acquittee's Sixth Amendment cross-examination rights were satisfied when he cross-examined the Board's expert. There was no substantive due process violation. The motion to dismiss, based on the constitutionality of &sect; 17a-593(c), was denied. The fact that the statute did not provide the same rights as were afforded in civil commitment proceedings was not an equal protection or other procedural due process violation. Finally, the state's motion was granted. The acquittee was mentally ill and had required antipsychotic medication since 1975. Without medication, which he would discontinue taking if left on his own, the acquittee rapidly decompensated and his violent behavior made him a threat to himself and others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The acquittee's motion to strike and motion to dismiss were both denied. The state's motion for continued commitment was granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee of defendant State of Connecticut brought suit on his own behalf and that of persons similarly situated in connection with alleged misdelivery to and taking by the State of stock in defendant corporation, the parent of defendant insurer, which the employee claimed the corporation should have delivered to him and the other class members upon the insurer's conversion from a mutual insurance company to a stock insurance company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants in the action were (1) the State and its former Governor, (&quot;State defendants&quot;), who allegedly caused the State to sell the misdelivered stock despite conflicting claims as to its ownership, and thereafter to retain all proceeds from its sale for the use of the State; and (2) four related entities of the insurer. The State defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The employee alleged that the State defendants' sale of disputed stock and continuing retention of the proceeds constituted a taking under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. Because the court was bound by supreme court precedent, it had to reject the State defendants' initial challenge to its subject-matter jurisdiction over the employee's constitutional takings claims. The court found that when the record was viewed in the light most favorable to the employee, there was at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he could establish that his and his fellow class members' &quot;group as a whole&quot; had a collective right under a conversion plan to receive stock or cash upon the demutualization of the insurer. The employee also based his takings claims upon a legitimate entitlement to a discrete property interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among other orders, the State defendants' motion to dismiss was granted as to all claims presented in counts three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen and seventeen of complaint II-A, and denied as to all claims based upon the employee's second (group as a whole) theory of entitlement to the disputed stock and stock sales proceeds, in counts ten, eleven, twelve and thirteen of complaint II-A.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF), filed a motion for modification of disposition by transfer of guardianship of a brother who had previously been adjudicated as neglected from DCF to his maternal grandmother. The Commissioner also filed a petition against respondents, mother and stepfather, to adjudicate a sister as neglected under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-120(9), (10) and for disposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the neglect trial, DCF presented evidence of a lengthy history of intervention in respondents' family, which included four younger half-siblings. Child welfare workers, relatives, a court-ordered evaluator, and others testified that both respondents had personality disorders, that they did not or could not support themselves or their children, that they had histories of transience and substance abuse, that the stepfather was cruel, sadistic, and violent, and that the brother and sister had been parentified and abused. Both children had lived with the grandmother, who had temporary custody of the sister, for several years. They wished to continue to do so. The court granted the motion to transfer the brother's custody to the grandmother. The transfer was in his best interest and necessary for his safety, stability, security, and permanence, and return to respondents was not in his best interest. The court found that DCF had established by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the sister was neglected under &sect; 46b-120(9), (10). It was in her best interest to be committed to DCF's custody, to remain in the grandmother's care, and to continue to live with her brother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the sister had been neglected and committed her care, custody, and guardianship to DCF until further order. The court vacated an order of temporary custody in favor of the grandmother with the expectation that DCF would allow the sister to continue to reside with the grandmother and the brother. The court granted the motion for transfer of care, custody, and guardianship of the brother to the grandmother.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While brandishing a sawed-off shotgun, the inmate, assisted by two accomplices, robbed a man. When the inmate was apprehended, he had a sawed-off shotgun in his possession. The inmate argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the admission of the shotgun into evidence, for failing to prevent the State from joining the robbery charge with the possession of the shotgun charge, and for permitting a joint trial with the other two co-defendants. The trial court disagreed. Any attempt by defense counsel to try to limit the use of the shotgun would have been unsuccessful. While there was a remote possibility that the shotgun defendant possessed was not the one used in the robbery, there was more than enough circumstantial evidence to permit the jury to conclude that it was. Further, there was no basis on which defense counsel could have successfully resisted the joinder of defendants and offenses. Defendant's conviction of robbery and conspiracy to commit the same robbery did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. There was no basis to conclude that there was any unreliability in the inmate's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner entered pleas in two dockets with an agreed upon total effective sentence of three years, to run concurrent with the sentences in two other dockets. In accordance with a plea agreement, he was sentenced to seven years to serve in the other two dockets. The judgment mittimus contained no order pertaining to presentence confinement credit. The prisoner insisted that the removal of 532 days of presentence confinement credit from one docket lengthened the seven-year sentence imposed in that docket. The appellate court held the prisoner's allegation that the 532 days were not applied to any docket was without merit. The prisoner was not deprived of any presentence confinement credits. Neither the State nor the judge made any promises regarding presentence confinement. The appellate court could not conclude that the State's conduct in any way implied that the State shared in the prisoner's understanding that he would receive the 532 days of presentence confinement credits at issue. The warden's calculations did not deprive him of the benefit of his plea bargain. The prisoner did not make a sufficient showing as to the performance or prejudice prong in regard to counsel.</SPAN></P>

Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that while the case was pending, the legislature had enacted 2005 Conn. Acts 10, allowing civil unions for same-sex couples but reserving marriage for opposite-sex couples. The act created an identical set of legal rights in Connecticut for same-sex and opposite-sex couples; thus, plaintiffs had failed to show that they had suffered legal harm. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that their civil rights were still impaired under the new act. The new act conferred the legal benefits of marriage upon same-sex couples; it was to those rights, not with the nomenclature used to define them, that was of constitutional concern. Furthermore, nothing in the act could be read as giving same-sex couples a lesser status than opposite-sex couples. Next, the use of the terms &quot;marriage&quot; and &quot;civil union&quot; was a mere difference in nomenclature that was not enough to invoke an equal protection or due process analysis. Even if the term &quot;civil union&quot; was not generally accepted in common parlance, this did not amount to legal harm. Finally, although most other states did not recognize same-sex civil unions, this was not caused by the nomenclature used in the Connecticut act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former inmate filed an action against defendants, the former commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Correction (DOC) and a former warden, alleging that his constitutional rights were violated when unnamed DOC personnel listened to the inmate's conversations in his cell. The inmate sought $3,500 in damages. Defendants sought dismissal pursuant to Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 10.30.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate did not state whether he was suing defendant in their individual or official capacities. The court found that the inmate's lawsuit needed to be characterized as an official capacity lawsuit because defendants were employees of the state at the time the lawsuit was commenced and the inmate was suing for conduct that related to defendants' employment. The court found that the state was the real party against whom relief was sought because the inmate sought to change conduct and policies with respect to the operation of a prison facility. Because the court concluded that the complaint was an action against defendants in their official capacity, the court found that the lawsuit was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The state had not consented to suit under the circumstances alleged in the lawsuit and had not waived its sovereign immunity. Additionally, even if the complaint could be construed as an action against defendants in their individual capacities, the statutory immunity conferred by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165 applied. The inmate had not alleged that defendants acted wantonly or maliciously or outside the discharge of their duties or scope of employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board recommended that the acquittee be recommitted for a period as it believed that he remained an individual with psychiatric disabilities to the extent that his discharge would have constituted a danger to himself or others. The court found that the admission of the report did not violate the acquittee's constitutional rights under the Sixth Amendment and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&nbsp;8 as (1) the acquittee had the opportunity to take part in the Board's hearing and present his own witnesses; (2) the acquittee, at the hearing before the court, cross-examined the State's psychiatrist, the sole witness at the Board's hearing; and (3) the admission of the report did not violate the acquittee's substantive due process rights. The court noted that none of the psychiatrists was able to testify that the acquittee would be a substantial or imminent danger to himself or others if he were let out of confinement. Thus, the court found that the State did not meet its burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the acquittee was mentally ill and a substantial danger to himself or to others, that he was gravely disabled, or that he was an imminent danger to himself or others.</SPAN></P>

He made numerous allegations that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI. After considering all of the evidence presented at the habeas trial, the court found that defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as the court was not persuaded that defendant met his burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the court found that (1) trial counsel was not at fault for failing to move to suppress a jacket found at the scene of the crime when there was no viable basis to so do; (2) trial counsel's failures to employ experts was neither deficient performance nor prejudicial; and (3) while the trial evidence clearly supported a finding that defendant and his brother were engaged in a joint adventure such that, if nothing else, defendant could have been held vicariously liable for the murder of the victim, trial counsel made sufficient efforts to cast doubt upon the government charges. Thus, there simply was no basis upon which the habeas court could conclude that there was any unreliability in defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Intervenor, Connecticut Judicial Department was allowed to intervene. The trial court (Connecticut) supplemented its decision for the justice from the bench with this opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Whether a legislative committee could obligate a sitting judicial officer to testify by way of a subpoena was a matter of first impression. The trial court noted that the subpoena was issued under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 2-46, which the Connecticut Attorney General had opined vested the Connecticut legislature with the broadest possible subpoena authority consistent with legislative powers. However, in the absence of express constitutional authority, the legislative branch's authority to subpoena members of the judiciary was not coterminous with its broad legislative authority. Under the separation of powers doctrine, the legislature could not subpoena a judicial official to give testimony relating to his official duties or functions, except where the Connecticut Constitution expressly permitted it, such as in the impeachment process. The subpoena was not issued pursuant to the appointment process. The trial court was confident that much of the information sought could be produced through voluntary cooperation. Further, the disciplinary process through the Connecticut Judicial Review Council created a very significant remedial framework to address the allegations of judicial misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted the motion to quash the subpoena and issued a temporary injunction barring any further requisite attendance at the hearing on the part of the justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, State of Connecticut, Judicial Branch, filed a motion to strike plaintiff judicial marshals' complaint for injunctive relief and damages for violation of the Connecticut Fair Employments Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat.&sect; 46a-58. The basis of the motion was the failure of the judicial marshals to name a necessary party to the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The marshals were members of a union local, working under a contract negotiated with the Judicial Branch by the union. The marshals were denied promotions because they were unable to obtain commercial driver's licenses, which the marshals blamed on their physical disabilities. The promotion qualifications were part of a contract negotiated by the union with the Judicial Branch. The Judicial Branch asserted that the union was a necessary party the union would have to work with the Judicial Branch if modifications to the contract were ordered by the court. The marshals denied that the union was a necessary party. The motion to strike was denied, but the court directed that the union be cited in as a party. The union was not an indispensible party in the employment discrimination case because its absence would not prejudice its rights. Any liability the Judicial Branch owned to the marshals was separable from the union's interest. However, the union did have an interest in the litigation, which made it the type of party whose presence was necessary to do complete justice by adjusting all the rights involved, particularly in light of the marshals' claim for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Judicial Branch's motion to strike was denied, however, its alternative request that the marshals be ordered to revise their complaint to add the union as a party was granted. The marshals were ordered to cite in the union as a party within 30 days.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parcel in question consisted of 0.36 acres and had wetlands running diagonally across it, comprising 57 percent of the entire parcel. The court found overwhelming support for the decision of the Commission. In fact there was scant evidence to support the proposition that the proposed use of the property would not have an adverse impact on the wetlands. Therefore, there was sufficient substantial evidence in the record to support the Commission's conclusion that the proposed activity would have an adverse impact on the wetlands as to both applications. The court also concluded that sufficient substantial evidence existed to support the Commission's conclusion that there were reasonable and prudent alternatives available to the property owner and the Commission's denial of the applications on that basis. Insofar as the language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-41(b)(2) was directory and not mandatory, the court found the actions of the Commission and the written record sufficient to comply with the provisions of &sect; 22a-41(b)(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed a complaint alleging that the state marshal was negligent for property damage to the company's vehicle that occurred when the state marshal seized the vehicle in connection with a matter pending before a trial court. The allegations of the complaint only alleged the state marshal's conduct acting as a state marshal, and did not assert any conduct that the state marshal took outside of his position as a state marshal. The state marshal filed a motion to dismiss and alleged that the company's lawsuit was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which meant that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case. The trial court granted the state marshal's motion to dismiss. The trial court found that the Spring test dictated that the lawsuit was one against a state official, that the state lawsuit concerned a matter in which the state official represented the state, that the state was the real party in interest, and that a judgment against the state marshal would hinder the activities of the state marshal commission. As a result, the trial court found that company's lawsuit was barred by the sovereign immunity doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state employee brought an action in four counts against defendants, a co-worker and two supervisors, in their individual capacities, alleging defamation per se, and a violation of her equal protection and due process rights that the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution guaranteed and that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 protected. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging qualified, absolute, and sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed that the co-worker accused her of an assault under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-61 and that the supervisors did not investigate her claims, thus violating her equal protection rights by selectively enforcing certain workplace policies. Defendants argued that the statements were immune because they were made in quasi-judicial proceeding, that of an affirmative action investigation. The court concluded that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether an affirmative action investigation existed or whether the meeting at which the statement was made was part of an investigation. While defendants argued a lack of proof of harm to the employee's reputation, but the court ruled that the alleged statement was defamation per se because an assault carried a jail sentence. Thus, the employee did not have to plead or prove harm to her reputation; it was presumed. As the parties disputed whether the workplace policy, which was based on a state order on workplace violence, was selectively applied, summary judgment was not due; that was particularly true when intent was an issue. There was also a genuine issue as to whether defendants' conduct was objectively reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Ct. &sect; 10-60(a), to amend its one-count complaint, by adding an additional ten paragraphs. Defendant, the Connecticut commissioner of revenue services, filed objections. The manufacturer was seeking a refund of certain sales and use tax payments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sales and use taxes were paid in conjunction with certain vehicles that the manufacturer had to repurchase from consumers under the Connecticut Lemon Law, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-179(d). The court denied the request for leave to amend, sustaining each of the commissioner's objections. The amendments improperly alleged a standard of review under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183 as tax appeals were de novo appeals that did not fall under &sect; 4-183. One paragraph's vague references to threatened rights fell because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-422 provided the manufacturer with an adequate remedy at law for preserving its rights. The manufacturer's attempt to raise the constitutionality of the Lemon Law failed as it could not seek the relief provided by the Lemon Law while at the same time raising questions of constitutionality. One proposed new paragraph fell for failure to comply with Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 10-1. Finally, the manufacturer could not invoke Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-29s or claim it was unconstitutional as the court was without authority to evaluate the merits of the commissioner's decision regarding the refund claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee brought an action against defendant state troopers pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-592, alleging that the troopers used excessive force in arresting her and that they subjected her to certain indignities and deliberate injury. The troopers filed a motion to dismiss counts two, three, and four, based on the doctrine of common-law sovereign immunity and the statutory provision for personal immunity in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arrestee claimed in part that the officers stomped on her chest and ordered a dog to attack her, which it did. The court denied their motion to dismiss, concluding that their conduct showed a wanton and reckless disregard for the arrestee's rights and safety, that it went beyond the scope of their official duties, and that &sect; 4-165 thus did not bar the claims. The court also concluded that the troopers had been sued in their individual capacities. There were for criteria to determining whether a suit was against a state or against state employees personally. While the officers were state employees, and the suit concerned an arrest in which they represented the state, the state was not the real party against which relief was sought, and the judgment would not subject the state to liability. Because the complaint sufficiently alleged actions from which wanton, reckless, or malicious conduct could be inferred, the challenged counts fit within an exception to &sect; 4-165. The court also ruled that under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5-141d and 29-8a, the State of Connecticut had to &quot;save harmless&quot; and indemnify a state officer only if the officer's conduct was not wanton, reckless, or malicious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured persons alleged in counts three and four of their complaint, that defendant state trooper was liable for injuries they incurred due to the trooper's operation of her cruiser in a reckless manner and in excess of her statutory authority as a state police officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured persons' truck collided with the trooper's state police cruiser. The injured persons filed a request to amend so as to remove the references they made to the trooper's official capacity and to add language to clarify that they intended to allege their claims against the trooper in her individual capacity. They argued that the mistake was a misnomer, which they should be permitted to correct pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-123. The injured persons sought monetary damages and did not seek a waiver from the claims commissioner before bringing their action. The court found that the essential nature of injured persons' allegations regarding the trooper was more akin to the nature of &quot;official capacity&quot; claims rather than &quot;individual capacity&quot; claims. Clearly, the injured persons alleged in counts three and four claims for monetary damages against the trooper in her official capacity. In light of that conclusion, the injured persons were required to seek the permission of the claims commissioner to bring the action. Thus, the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the claims.</SPAN></P>

The public defender claimed that he had official immunity and that the client had failed to exhaust administrative remedies under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-165.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pro se client's complaint consisted of one count alleging legal malpractice and the infliction of emotional distress. The client did not allege that the public defender's actions resulted in any conviction or that a conviction had been invalidated before the action was filed. The court granted the motion to dismiss the action. Taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the complaint's allegations did not establish that the public defender acted in a wanton, reckless, or malicious manner or that his state of mind or his conduct rose to the requisite level of egregiousness. He was therefore immune from suit under &sect; 4-165. Under &sect; 4-165, any person seeking damages against a state employee who was immune from suit could file a claim with the Connecticut State Claims Commission, and failure to exhaust this remedy was grounds for dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The complaint did not allege that any claim had been filed with the Commission or that the Connecticut Claims Commissioner had authorized a civil action pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-160.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Commissioner of Agriculture filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendant trustees to enjoin them from developing land as a golf course. The Commissioner filed a motion to strike the trustees' new special defenses and a motion to dismiss the trustees' counterclaim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner had purchased development rights from the trustees' predecessor in interest pursuant to the farmland preservation program in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22-26aa et seq. The court first held that when it granted the trustees' motion to amend their answer, this did not bar the Commissioner from filing motions to strike and to dismiss. It was usually inappropriate in ruling on a motion to amend to address the merits of the underlying action that was the subject of the motion. Turning to the special defenses, the court stated that the farmland preservation program was not inconsistent with the state plan of conservation and development set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16a-27. The trustees' attack on the administration of the program was not an appropriate special defense. The trustees' argument that a golf course was a &quot;turf farm&quot; was unconvincing. As for the counterclaim alleging inverse condemnation, to survive a motion to dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity, it had to allege sufficient facts to support a finding of a constitutional taking. The trustees had alleged nothing more than a diminution in value. This was insufficient to show a constitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father, as next friend of his minor child, filed an application for a restraining order against defendant mother pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-15. The mother filed a motion to dismiss the application, or, in the alternative, to consolidate with a pending dissolution of marriage action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was required to decide whether a pending dissolution action between the father and the mother required dismissal of the action for a restraining order. The court was also required to decide whether the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the minor child divested the father of standing to bring the action for a restraining order on behalf of his minor child. The court noted that the father brought the action not in his own right, but on behalf of the minor child, who, because of age, was incompetent under the law to bring suit on his own. The court could find no reason why the minor child was not entitled to the procedures and protections of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-15. Thus, dismissal of the restraining order action on the grounds of a prior pending action was not proper. Additionally, the dissolution and the restraining order actions did not involve identical parties. Moreover, the legal and factual issues were distinctly different. Thus, the granting of the motion to consolidate was not proper. Finally, a hearing was necessary to determine whether the guardian ad litem was the proper person to bring the &sect; 46b-15 application on the minor child's behalf at that time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss was denied, and the motion to consolidate was denied. Further, the clerk was directed to schedule a hearing to determine whether a guardian ad litem was to be substituted for the father as next friend for the minor and, if not, whether the father was the proper person to maintain the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who pled guilty to risk of injury to a minor and sexual assault in the fourth degree, moved for a reduction of his sentence. Defendant was sentenced to a total effective sentence of six years, execution suspended after two years, and 10 years' probation. The parties agreed that the primary issue was one of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to modify his sentence seeking to suspend the execution of the remainder of the two-year sentence he was serving. Defendant contended that the court possessed both a rule-based and an inherent jurisdiction to modify the sentences it previously imposed. Given that the defendant's sentence consists of a &quot;top&quot; number of greater than three years and a &quot;bottom&quot; number of less than three years, the question of whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-39(a) or (b) applied necessarily depended on the part of the split sentence which was properly characterized as the &quot;definite sentence&quot; referred to in &sect; 53a-39. The court held that the sentence imposed upon defendant was a &quot;definite sentence&quot; of six years and that, accordingly, &sect; 53a-39(b) applied. Under &sect; 53a-39(b), the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain a motion to modify a sentence unless the state's attorney agreed to defendant's request for review. It was undisputed that the state's attorney did not agree. Also, defendant did not meet his burden of proving that the statutory scheme for sentence modification was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a neighbor, appealed from a decision of defendant, a city planning and zoning commission, which ruled that the application by defendant, a seller, to subdivide her commercial real property and sell a portion thereof to defendant, a purchaser, was a so-called &quot;first cut&quot; and was, therefore, not subject to the town's subdivision regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his appeal, the neighbor not only challenged the decision concerning the subdivision, but sought to overturn an alleged change of zone granted on July 21, 2000. The seller argued that any review by the court of the July 21, 2000, decision was barred by General Statutes &sect; 8-8(r). The court initially noted that the neighbor failed to plead aggrievement regarding the 2000 decision. The neighbor did not own his abutting property at the time of the 2000 decision, so he was not classically aggrieved. The court further held that the fact that the neighbor held a first mortgage on the property at the time of the decision did not render him statutorily aggrieved under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8. The neighbor failed to show that he would be denied the ability to recover the full amount of the principal remaining on the mortgage through foreclosure. Therefore, the neighbor failed to establish aggrievement as to the 2000 decision. The court further held that his appeal of the 2000 decision was time-barred under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(r). The court held that this statute acted as a statute of limitations, and the appeal was not filed in a timely fashion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neighbor was barred from challenging the July 21, 2000 decision of the commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a prisoner, sought a writ of habeas corpus challenging his convictions of manslaughter in the 1st degree in violation of Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after a child that had been left in his care died of injuries indicating that the child had been shaken. The prisoner argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of both the United States and Connecticut Constitutions. The court held that trial counsel's decision not to hire a hiring a neuropathologist to advise on the case did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. There was an abundance of circumstantial evidence that pointed to the conclusion that the fatal action occurred during the time in which petitioner was the only adult with access to the child. Nothing at the habeas trial in any way attacked that evidence. The court found that trial counsel mounted a spirited attack on the evidence through the use of another expert witness. The court further held that the prisoner failed to show that the failure to call a neuropathologist prejudiced him. Based on the evidence presented at trial, the prisoner was unable to show a reasonable probability that hiring the neuropathologist would have changed the outcome of the trial.</SPAN></P>
