</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant inmate was resentenced for his armed robbery and attempted armed robbery convictions, he petitioned for credit for time served on both sentences. Appellee Department of Public Safety and Corrections denied his petition, and the inmate sought judicial review. The 19th Judicial District Court of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, denied the inmate relief based on the commissioner's recommendation. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the inmate argued that the trial court's ruling was erroneous because it was based upon an incorrect interpretation by the commissioner of whether the trial court intended to grant him credit for time served on both of his sentences. The inmate maintained that it was the sentencing judge's intent, not that of the Department, which governed the conditions upon which his sentences had to be served. The appellate court agreed, finding that although&nbsp;it was unclear why the trial court resentenced the inmate on the armed robbery count, and no argument was made with respect to the armed robbery count, the minute entry from the original resentencing indicated that the trial court imposed both sentences with credit for time served. Furthermore, the minute entry did not contradict the sentencing transcript.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's ruling was reversed and the Department was ordered to compute the inmate's armed robbery and attempted armed robbery sentence with credit for time served.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lincoln, Louisiana, convicted defendant of misapplication of construction contract payments, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:202. The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence and entered a judgment of acquittal. The supreme court remanded the matter for consideration of defendant's remaining assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to quash the bill of information and motion in arrest of judgment, in which he argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:202 was unconstitutional. The appellate court determined that the activity proscribed by the statute was sufficiently narrow and gave adequate notice to those who would engage in such conduct, i.e., fail to apply monies received pursuant to a construction contract as necessary to settle claims for material and labor, that the conduct was proscribed. Defendant was provided ample time to conduct any further discovery. The trial court did not err in granting a recess where it was satisfied by the State's allegations that defendant had played a role in a witness's failure to appear. Defendant did not show how testimony with regard to his failure to complete the project and the consequences was irrelevant in determining if funds were misapplied. The trial judge did not err in refusing to give defendant's requested jury instructions. The allegations in the information were sufficient to determine the grade of the offense charged. The jury was not required to determine a specific amount of funds misapplied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, deceased patient's family, challenged a judgment of the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana) that denied their motion for summary judgment, granted summary judgment for defendant hospital, and upheld the constitutionally of the limitation on recovery or &quot;cap&quot; provisions of the Louisiana Medical Malpractice Act (MMA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was previously before the court, along with another case, in which plaintiffs sought to have the &quot;the cap&quot; or limitations on recovery for damages under the MMA declared unconstitutional. The Louisiana Supreme Court denied the court's request for certification and remanded the cases for the court to consider the appeals. The court held that the current $ 500,000.00 cap failed to provide an adequate remedy and, thus, was unconstitutional under the provisions of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22, which assured Louisiana citizens of an adequate remedy under the law for injury to their persons. The court found that competent evidence was presented to show that after considering the devaluation of the dollar in the 30 years since the passage of the MMA, the $ 500,000.00 limit imposed in 1975 was worth only $ 160,000.00 and thus did not provide an adequate remedy to today's severely injured plaintiffs. The court found that in order to grant today's plaintiff the same relief the legislature granted to plaintiffs in 1975, the cap would have to be raised to $ 1,562,500.00. Because the court found merit in plaintiffs' &quot;adequate remedy&quot; argument, it did not discuss plaintiffs' other arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, based on its finding that the $ 500,000.00 cap on medical malpractice damages were unconstitutional. The court remanded the case to the trial court for the consideration of what constituted adequate damages and assessed all costs of the appeal against defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Parish of Avoyelles (Louisiana) of unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction. The court of appeals disagreed. During the trial, the victims both testified that they were inside the structure, which they both called an apartment, at the time of the incident. Defendant admitted in his own testimony that he went to the apartment and pushed the air conditioner through the wall in order to see inside because he wanted to see if one victim was entertaining a boyfriend there. There was no testimony offered at trial to suggest that defendant went to the main house prior to approaching the apartment. Consequently, defendant's actions demonstrated that he went there because he was aware, at least, that the victim spent sufficient time in the apartment and that she would be likely to be found there if she was entertaining. In addition, the victims were actually in the apartment when the episode occurred. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence for the offense of unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling was affirmed. However, his sentence of six years at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence was amended to delete the denial of parole eligibility, and the trial court was instructed to make an entry in the minutes to reflect that change.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of intimidating the victim by threatening her verbally and by letter after he was arrested for beating her. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err by allowing defendant to represent himself, even though it did not specifically inquire about defendant's educational level and experience or explain the nature of the charges against him or the range of penalties, because the record showed that defendant was sufficiently articulate and intelligent to knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel. From pretrial observations, the trial court could determine that defendant was articulate, that he generally asked relevant questions, that he was respectful in court, and that he was intelligent. Defendant stated in a pretrial hearing that he needed to use the law library at the prison, indicating that he was aware of the procedures followed in the criminal justice system. Defendant's questioning of one of the members of the sanity committee at a pretrial hearing clearly showed that he was well aware of the nature of his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that the trial court granted the district attorney's exceptions without reason when no jurisprudence or statutory authority was cited by the district attorney. The appellate court did not find that the inmate had a right of action, and the claim was barred by res judicata. The inmate had no real or actual interest in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34.2B(3) being declared unconstitutional. He was not currently threatened with prosecution under the statute. He had already been convicted of the crime and his conviction and sentence were final. He had no actual, justiciable controversy that would provide him a right of action in the declaratory action. During the criminal proceeding against the inmate, including the post-conviction relief application, writs, and appeals, he did not question the constitutionality of the statute under which he had been charged and pled guilty. His conviction and sentence were now final. Therefore, he was now barred from relitigating this matter by claiming the criminal statute was unconstitutional through this civil action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot his wife as she was attempting to leave him. When police arrived and searched defendant's residence, marijuana was found inside. Defendant was convicted of two charges, and he sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:94 was not unconstitutional as applied. Section 14:94(A) was distinguished from &sect; 14:94(F) because the latter subsection required proof of the additional element of the intentional use of force or violence being used on a victim. That defendant shot the victim while he was intentionally chasing her distinguished his actions from those in &sect;&nbsp;14:94(A). Moreover, the district attorney had broad discretion in deciding what charges to initiate; therefore, the decision to charge defendant was a crime with a higher penalty did not render the statute unconstitutional. The statute was not vague because there was adequate notice of what conduct was proscribed and the penalty for a violation thereof. Next, the State was not required to prove that a nexus existed between the firearm and drug offense because defendant was in actual possession of the firearm, and proof of actual possession of the drugs was not required.</SPAN></P>

The bill of information was filed in December 2000 and defendant made her first appearance in court without counsel in January 2001. After continuances filed by defendant and the State with defendant switching attorneys twice, defendant filed a motion to quash the prosecution in May 2003. The court affirmed, and held that defendant showed no prejudice from the case being transferred to another judge within the same district when the first judge recused himself. The court also held that defendant's filing of a discovery motion triggered the one-year period provided by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. Art. 580, and thus the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to quash in that it gave the state one year from filing on July 9, 2002 to bring the matter to trial. Also, while the trial court did not comply with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, the trial court had not authority to reconsider the sentence because defendant did not file a timely motion to reconsider. Further, defendant's less-than-midrange sentence without a fine was not constitutionally excessive even for a first offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which convicted him of aggravated rape in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for aggravated rape, but the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's arguments that the closeness of the definitions of the two crimes, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:42(A)(2) and 14:42.1(A)(1) tainted the jury's verdict. The jury's prime function of determining the sufficiency of the evidence for a charged crime was fully and correctly exercised. The court further found no error in the trial court's refusal to give a special jury charge regarding the &quot;virtually identical&quot; crime definitions for aggravated and forcible rape. The trial court's charge read the definitions of both crimes and the applicable sentences to the jury and that was sufficient to advise them of the elements of the crimes and, by implication, to inform them of their power to give a responsive verdict of forcible rape. Under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 702, the court found no error in the trial court's acceptance of a sexual assault nurse examiner as an expert based primarily on her actual experience with rape victims. Additionally, defendant's life sentence was not excessive under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A decedent was awarded damages in a personal injury case. The taxpayer, the decedent's wife, paid an Internal Revenue Service assessment on the interest on the award after the decedent's death. When the department assessed the taxpayer for the same, she contended that she owed no taxes on prejudgment interest under Louisiana law. The Board and the trial court disagreed with her position, and she sought review. In reversing, the appellate court held that the district court had authority to review the decision of the Board under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;47:1435, and it was error to sustain an objection of no right of action as to the taxpayer's constitutional issue. However, it was not necessary to determine the constitutional issue raised. The appellate court found that prejudgment interest was excluded from gross income under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:46. It was noted that Louisiana conformed its laws with federal tax law. Under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect;&nbsp;104(a)(2), prejudgment interest was not excluded as gross income. However, civil law recognized prejudgment interest as an element of damages, pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2000. Therefore, it was treated differently under Louisiana law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court and the Board were reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims were shot and killed during an armed robbery while they worked at a liquor store and defendant was subsequently convicted of two counts of second-degree murder. On appeal, the court affirmed, stating that his role as a principal in the armed robbery was supported by the evidence, in particular, his own statements to police. Those statements established his participation with another individual in planning the armed robbery, including their use of a pistol. Defendant's subsequent statements to his girlfriend and another friend that defendant was involved in the robbery at the liquor store and the testimony of two other individuals clearly established defendant's culpability. The court further stated that the record supported the trial court's finding that defendant clearly and unequivocally initiated, through his family, his desire to talk with officers and validly reversed his earlier hesitancy to speak without counsel. His sentence was appropriate because he was a willing participant in an armed robbery that resulted in the senseless and brutal killing of two men.</SPAN></P>

They responded to the partition, but the trial court granted a partition by licitation. Thereafter, the owners filed a devolutive appeal. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the trial court properly denied the owners' peremptory exception of non-joinder of an indispensable party under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 641, La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 642. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4985 was meant to outline the precise situation which occurred in this case. The fact that one or more co-owners to property was not named in litigation surrounding the case did not affect the validity of a partition to those who were involved in the same litigation. Moreover, the constitution challenges under La. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 2, 4 and the Fourteenth Amendment were also rejected. The appellate court held that La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to molestation of a juvenile, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.2, and was sentenced to serve eight years at hard labor, two years suspended, and upon release be placed on active supervised probation for three years. The 13th Judicial District Court, Parish of Evangeline (Louisiana) also found the offense was a crime of violence as defined by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:2(13). Defendant appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">First, defendant argued that the court erred in sentencing him as having committed a crime of violence. Molestation of a juvenile, was not listed as a crime of violence in &sect;&nbsp;14:2(13). However, at least one court had held the list was illustrative, rather than exclusive. Defendant argued there was no evidence that his crime was violent, because no serious bodily injury occurred. At issue was not whether the instant offense was executed in a violent manner, but whether molestation of a juvenile generally, as defined by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.2, was a &quot;crime of violence,&quot; as defined by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:2(13). Molestation was inherently a crime of violence. Such crimes were of a genera that was violent in nature. The trial court did not err by finding defendant committed a crime of violence. Further, defendant did not point to any consequences the designation produced in his sentence. Diminution of the sentence was not affected by the designation, since molestation of a juvenile was clearly a sex offense, and thus was precluded from such diminution, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:537. Also, suspension of sentence was not precluded for a first-offense violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The case was remanded for the trial court to impose the mandatory conditions of probation and a probation supervision fee in accordance. The trial court was also instructed to deny defendant eligibility for diminution of sentence. Lastly, the trial court was instructed to advise defendant of the prescriptive period for filing post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, which entered judgment on a jury verdict and convicted defendant of armed robbery using a firearm, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 14:64 and 14:64.3, and which sentenced him, as an adjudicated habitual offender, to 203 years at hard labor with credit for time served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted for his part in a bank robbery. On appeal, defendant argued, among other things, that the State failed to prove that the 10-year maximum period between offenses, set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, had not expired. In affirming the conviction but amending the sentence, the court first found that the trial court did not err in calculating that the 10-year period between convictions had not elapsed. Next, even though the State failed to provide fingerprint evidence identifying defendant as the person who committed both crimes, the court noted that identity was proved by defendant's own admissions at the armed robbery trial and by the certified bill of information and court minutes from the previous conviction. Finally, the court determined that, although the sentence was not constitutionally excessive, it was illegal in that the trial court improperly applied the five-year enhancement set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64.3 because the applicable sentence under the habitual offender law effectively replaced the sentence for the underlying crime under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:64 and 14:64.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction, amended the sentence by reducing it by five years, without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence, and affirmed the judgment of sentence as amended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for directing an undercover detective to a drug dealer, from whom the detective purchased cocaine and marijuana. On appeal, the court held that the State proved that defendant was a principal to the sale of drugs to the detective because the jury could have reasonably inferred from a videotape of the transaction and the detective's testimony that defendant had arranged with the drug dealer to assist him in selling narcotics by taking potential buyers to him. Defendant's argument that the trial court erred in denying his challenges for cause as to three prospective jurors and prejudicing him by forcing him to use peremptory challenges to excuse them was rejected because the record showed that defendant had six peremptory challenges remaining when jury selection was completed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion in limine, seeking suppression of evidence concerning the drug dealer based on defendant's allegation that the State failed to inform defendant prior to trial that the drug dealer was an alleged co-perpetrator, because it was evident from the State's discovery response attachments that he was the co-perpetrator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. On appeal, the court held that La. Rev. Stat.

The court rejected defendant's contention that the evidence was insufficient on the ground that the State failed to prove his status as the victim's stepfather at the time of the acts because the victim consistently testified that she was around eight or nine when the incidents occurred and that they occurred after defendant married her mother in July 2001. The evidence was also sufficient to support defendant's conviction of indecent behavior with a juvenile because lewd and lascivious behavior was established. Defendant showed the victim sexually explicit shows immediately prior to making her &quot;rub his private part until white stuff came out.&quot; The victim's description of what she saw on television, &quot;naked people having sex,&quot; effectively conveyed material that sufficiently qualified as an indecent sexual display.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alligator farm alleged that appellee department of wildlife collected tag fees on alligators and alligator skins shipped out of state, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 56:253C(2)(a), and 56:256, and that the statutes were unconstitutional. The 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) found the statutes constitutional and granted the department's exception of no cause of action. The farm appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Commerce Clause/Complete Auto analysis, the failure to tax all raw hides, if proven, could have been found to have been an unfair apportionment of the tax and a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce. Similarly, under the Michelin analysis, a discriminatory tax could have been found to have violated the Export-Import Clause by singling out exportation and discouraging it in a manner inconsistent with federal policy. Thus, the farm sufficiently stated at least one basis for its cause of action asserting constitutional challenges. If the farm proved that fees and taxes were levied or collected on the skins themselves while &quot;in transit,&quot; the exaction might initially qualify as a per se violation of the Import-Export Clause, whether or not the Michelin analysis applied. Under the &quot;stream of export&quot; doctrine, or as a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce, a levy on any goods themselves while in transit could likely have violated the Commerce Clause as well. Thus there were instances where, based solely on the factual allegations taken as true, analyzed under the wording of the statutes and applicable law, the company had sufficiently stated a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. The case was remanded. The costs of the appeal, $ 480, were assessed to the department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A workers' compensation judge (WCJ) in the Office of Workers' Compensation (OWC), No. 4, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana) found that appellant claimant had made a willfully false statement for the purpose of obtaining and continuing workers' compensation benefits in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;23:1208 and that appellee employer unreasonably paid the first week of benefits in a late and untimely manner. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The WCJ found that when the claimant directly stated, under oath, that he could not get up on roofs and could not perform roofing duties, he willfully made a false statement. Given the videotape of his performing roofing duties on a roof, in direct contradiction to his sworn statement, the judgment that the claimant was in violation of &sect; 23:1208(A) as of the date of that statement, and that he should suffer the forfeiture of any benefits accruing under the workers' compensation statute from that point forward as required by &sect; 23:1208(E), was not in error. It was against the purpose of the statute to penalize a claimant retroactively to the date when benefits accrued. Violations yielding forfeiture had to be proven by the one alleging fraud. Unless the one alleging fraud could prove that false, willful statements or representations made to obtain benefits were made when benefits first accrued, forfeiture occurred prospectively from the date of proven violations. Given that the employer could not prove the claimant violated &sect; 23:1208 at the time his benefits first accrued, the WCJ's assessment of a penalty and attorney fees against the employer for late payment was correct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana), denied defendant's motion to suppress his identification by the victim, his statement, and the evidence. A jury found him guilty of first degree robbery, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64.1. Defendant's motions for a new trial and for a post verdict judgment of acquittal were denied. He moved for reconsideration of his sentence, but the motion was also denied. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant told the victim that he had a knife and to give him his money. Defendant's right hand was underneath his sweater. The victim surrendered his two twenty-dollar bills to defendant because he felt threatened by him. The victim indicated he did not fight back because he was afraid defendant had a knife. The victim believed that defendant had a knife because of the threat defendant had made and due to a hand motion defendant had made underneath his sweater. The evidence thus viewed established that defendant induced a subjective belief in the victim that defendant was armed with a dangerous weapon and that the victim's belief was objectively reasonable under the circumstances. Therefore, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of first degree robbery of the victim under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 16:64.1(A). Also, nothing in the caselaw suggested that the jury's verdict had to be unanimous for defendant's sentence to be increased. Thus, La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17(A) and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 782(A) were not unconstitutional and not violative of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

Docket No. 367199, Division &quot;I&quot;. Honorable Reginald T. Badeaux, III, Judge Presiding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the 22nd Judicial District Court Parish of St. Tammany, Louisiana that convicted him of aggravated rape, a violation of the aggravated rape statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42; sentenced him to life in prison without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence; and denied his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial because the verdict was not by a unanimous jury as required by La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17(A) in capital cases.  The State argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42 was not unconstitutional, as it specifically provided for prosecution of the aggravated rape of a victim under 12 years as &quot;either&quot; a capital offense or a non-capital life imprisonment offense. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42 was amended in 1997 and allowed a non-unanimous verdict in non-capital prosecutions only. The court held that there was no conflict between &sect; 14:42 and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17(A) because once the district attorney opted to prosecute the offense as a non-capital life imprisonment offense, capital punishment was no longer a possibility; therefore the unanimity requirement of Artcle I, &sect; 17(A) was no longer applicable. The court noted that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 782(A), which governed cases involving confinement at hard labor, was triggered. Therefore the court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to require a unanimous verdict and denying defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judicial candidate sought injunctive relief alleging that defendant opponent caused false allegations about the candidate to be distributed in campaign literature. The 22nd Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany, Louisiana found the motion to be moot, and allowed the candidate to amend his petition to allege defamation. The trial court then granted the opponent's motion to strike pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 971.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opponent had filed the special motion to strike pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 971, arguing that the candidate had maliciously sued him in an attempt to curtail protected political speech in direct violation of the First Amendment. The trial court granted the motion, and the candidate appealed. The court held that the opponent's special motion to strike was properly granted because the opponent met his burden to show that the case involved protected free speech with a connection to a public issue, as provided in Article 971, which then shifted the burden to the candidate to establish a probability of success on his defamation claim. The court found that there was nothing in the record to suggest that the candidate would be able to satisfy the elements of his defamation action, namely, that the publications were false, that the opponent acted with actual malice, or that the candidate sustained any injury as a result of the publications. The court also noted that the candidate had not properly raised a constitutional challenge to Article 971, and that the opponent's claim for attorney fees was not addressed in the trial court, and thus not considered in the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment that granted the opponent's special motion to strike and dismissed the judicial candidate's action with prejudice. The court assessed all costs associated with the appeal against the candidate, but found that the opponent represented himself and thus did not incur any attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied her motions for post verdict judgment of acquittal and a new trial and sentenced her to life imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's girlfriend testified that she witnessed defendant deliver to the victim two pills.

Thus, the evidence supported beyond a reasonable doubt the jury's conclusions that defendant distributed methadone to the victim and that he ingested the illicit drugs. Also, the evidence was sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact that the methadone was the direct cause of the victim's death because all three medical experts agreed that whether the victim died as a result of respiratory suppression from ingesting a combination of methadone and benzodiazepine or from vomiting, it was the presence of both drugs that gave rise to the hypoxic brain injury that ultimately caused the victim's death. But for the ingestion of the methadone that defendant distributed to the victim he would not have died.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff stockholders challenged a decision from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which sustained an exception of lack of personal jurisdiction over appellee directors in a case arising under the Louisiana Blue Sky Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:701 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The stockholders contended that financial information was not revealed to them in violation of the Blue Sky Law. The directors were sued on the ground that they knew or should have known of the alleged fraudulent inducements and activities. The directors' exception based on lack of personal jurisdiction was sustained, and the stockholders sought review. In reversing, the appellate court determined that long-arm jurisdiction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3201B was coextensive with the federal constitutional due process requirements. The corporation in this case directed its activities toward the residents of Louisiana. As to the individual directors, they manifestly availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business in the forum and being protected by its laws; therefore, it was not unreasonable to require them to submit to litigation in Louisiana as well. The directors failed to show that jurisdiction would have been unreasonable in light of traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Finally, the appellate court rejected the argument that the &quot;fiduciary shield&quot; doctrine precluded the exercise of personal jurisdiction over the directors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the 17th Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Lafourche (Louisiana) found defendant guilty of vehicular homicide, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32.1. He was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment at hard labor. He was then adjudicated a fourth felony habitual offender. The trial court vacated the previous sentence and sentenced him to 40 years' imprisonment at hard labor. It then denied his motion to reconsider. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that there was sufficient evidence of a causal relationship between defendant's blood-alcohol concentration and the victim's death to support his vehicular homicide conviction. The evidence showed that defendant was highly intoxicated at the time of the accident. Also, a doctor testified that defendant's blood-alcohol concentration of .24 grams percent would have impaired defendant's judgment and vision and slowed his reaction ability. Further, it was reasonable for the jury to infer that defendant's blood-alcohol concentration contributed to his lack of judgment. In addition, the jury could have reasonably disregarded the hypothesis that, even sober, defendant could not have avoided the accident. Thus, defendant's intoxication combined with his operation of his automobile was the cause of the victim's death. However, for purposes of his adjudication as a fourth felony habitual offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1C, the State failed to prove that the 10-year cleansing period between the 1979 conviction and the 1995 predicate offense had not lapsed; thus, the appellate court found that defendant's habitual offender adjudication was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction for vehicular homicide, reversed the habitual offender adjudication, vacated the habitual offender sentence, reinstated the sentence on vehicular homicide, and remanded for further proceedings on the habitual offender bill.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowner sought a special exception use pursuant to Caddo Parish, La., Ordinance 51-1126,&nbsp;so that he could sell his land to developer who wanted to build a truck stop/casino. The zoning board granted the exception. Appellee parish commission reversed that grant. The First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) reversed the decision of the commission. Intervenor area resident appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner argued that the testimony presented at trial to refute the concerns raised at the public hearing was a sufficient basis for the trial court to reverse the decision of the commission. However, the appellate court held that the landowner's burden was not simply to rebut the concerns expressed by residents and commissioners, but to demonstrate that the commission's decision to deny the special exception did not have any substantial relationship to the public health, safety and welfare. The appellate court held that the commission acted after considering the costs and benefits to the public that would result from approval of the special exception use, including the safety and health implications of increased gambling and alcohol consumption. In addition, the comments of commissioners who voted to deny the exception reflected a decision that gambling and alcohol sales were not compatible with the expected need for future residential development in the area surrounding the proposed facility. That was a reasonable consideration since a new residential subdivision was being built in close proximity to the site. Thus, the landowner failed to satisfy his burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was reversed and the parish commission's decision denying the special exception use was reinstated. Costs of the appeal were assessed to the landowner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) that convicted him of distribution of marijuana, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(A), and sentenced him as a second offender, pursuant to the Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed his sentence was excessive considering his age, background, and lack of criminal history; and that the trial judge failed to state reasons for sentencing as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. Defendant was sentenced on the marijuana charge as a second offender based on a prior arrest and guilty plea to possession of cocaine when he was 18 years old. On appeal, the court held that it was unable to ascertain whether or not the trial court considered any of the factors in Article 894.1 because the trial court did not give any reasons for sentencing or indicate that it had considered the factors in Article 894.1. Also the record reflected that defendant only had $ 14 and a bag with 1.8 grams of marijuana on his person when he was arrested.  The court noted that defendant's past criminal history was not of a violent nature. Therefore, the court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded the case with instructions for the trial court to consider the factors in Article 894.1, if it had not done so; 2001 La. Acts 403, which reduced penalties for drug offenses for non-violent offenders; and review Dorthey factors in its resentencing determination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Sixteenth Judicial District Court (Louisiana) of possession of cocaine, second offense, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:967 and 40:982, and distribution of cocaine, second offense, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:967 and 40:982. Defendant appealed his convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill of information contained allegations that defendant had prior drug-related convictions. While defendant was awaiting sentencing, the state supreme court ruled that allegations of prior offenses could not be placed in the charging instrument of a subsequent offense for purposes of sentence enhancement under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:982. On appeal, the court held that it was error for the State to charge the prior offenses in the bill of information because the applicable ruling of the state supreme court applied retroactively. The second-offense convictions under &sect; 40:982 had to be reversed as convictions for non-crimes, but the portion of the offenses based on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967 was severable from the non-crimes of second-offense possession and second-offense distribution. Although it was error to expose the jury to the fact of defendant's prior convictions, the court determined that the error was harmless as to the &sect; 40:967 violations because of the strong evidence regarding defendant's sale of cocaine to an undercover officer. The court concluded that defendant's motion to suppress was waived when he proceeded to trial without obtaining a ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the second-offense portions of defendant's convictions, vacated defendant's sentences, ordered the entry of convictions for the lesser offenses of possession of cocaine and distribution of cocaine, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Webster (Louisiana) convicted defendant of two counts of video voyeurism involving a child under 17 and one count of video voyeurism, La.

He was sentenced to serve five years' imprisonment at hard labor on count one, 10 years on count two, and 10 years on count three without benefits, with the sentences to be served concurrently. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, two victims testified that they both tried on clothes, including bathing suits, in the dressing room while defendant was at the store counter. When defendant later left the store for a short time, the girls discovered a monitor hidden behind the counter. They flipped through the channels and saw that one view was of the inside of the dressing room. Upon close inspection of the dressing room, they slid a mirror to the side and discovered a hole in the wall with a camera inside. The victims identified themselves in a dressing room videotape, one of the many discovered in defendant's car, and stated that they were unaware that they were being videotaped by defendant and denied ever giving him permission to videotape them. A third victim identified herself in a dressing room videotape and stated that she was unaware that she was being videotaped by defendant and denied ever giving him permission to videotape her. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's three convictions for video voyeurism. But, the sentence imposed for count three was illegal because it was five years more than the maximum possible sentence under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:283(B)(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions but vacated his sentences and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier (Louisiana) convicted defendant of attempted armed robbery and two counts of aggravated battery, La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record was sufficient to show that defendant was the person who attempted to rob a grocery store, and that he fired a shot that injured the store's owner. Therefore, the convictions for attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:27, 14:64, and 14:34, of the store's owner were supported by the record. Also, although defendant stated that he did not intend to kill the store's owner or one of its employees during the attempted robbery, both women testified that defendant threatened to kill them prior to firing the shots. The store's owner testified that she thought that he had killed the employee (her sister) and that he was going to kill her as well. Defendant's action in firing a sequence of gunshots into the confined space where the store's owner and the employee were standing implied that defendant either intended to kill both women, or he intended to inflict great bodily harm. For those reasons, the evidence was sufficient to support the elements of the greater offense of attempted first degree murder. Accordingly, the responsive verdict for attempted first degree murder, aggravated battery, was supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence imposed by the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), after a jury found defendant guilty of possession of cocaine, in violation of La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged statements made by the State regarding sentencing and claimed that his sentence was excessive. On review, the court found no error. The State's comments related to defendant's most recent conviction, and the choice to permit an argument about the penalty was within the discretion of the district court judge. Considering the factors enunciated by the district court at the sentencing hearing, the court found that defendant's sentence was not excessive pursuant to La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The district court noted defendant's long history of drug related arrests, and the maximum sentence he could have received as a third offender was 10 years. Thus, defendant failed to show that the district court abused the liberal discretion allowed in sentencing. Further, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 was not unconstitutionally applied to defendant because he was not punished for being a drug addict but for possessing cocaine and for two prior convictions for possession of crack. Finally, the habitual offender sentence did not violate the Due Process Clause or the right to a jury because the enhancement was for prior convictions, which did not require fact finding by a jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of distribution of cocaine and possession with the intent to distribute cocaine. On the first count, he was sentenced to life imprisonment under the Habitual Offender Law. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison on the second count. The sentences were to be served concurrently. On appeal, defendant claimed that the life sentence was excessive under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20. The court found that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in sentencing defendant under the Habitual Offender Law. The trial judge noted at the sentencing hearing that defendant had a lengthy and extensive criminal history that dated back to him reaching the age of majority. The presentence report showed that defendant had violated both his probation and his parole when they had been granted to him. Thus, defendant had not taken advantage of the opportunities made available to him. The trial judge had considered the mitigating factors that were presented at the sentencing hearing, including the fact that defendant was addicted to drugs when he committed the crimes for which he was convicted. Defendant's reliance on Apprendi was misplaced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was subject to punishment under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:4611(1)(b)&nbsp;for violating a restraining order prohibiting him from contacting respondent. He was given a determinate sentence in the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) of 120 days, 100 of which were suspended. Inter alia, he was not allowed to put on a defense and he was not advised of the right to a jury trial. Appellant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the appellate court to again consider the scope of rights to be afforded a party in a civil proceeding subject to contempt punishable under &sect; 13:4611(1)(b) and whether appellant was deprived of such rights. His sentence of 120 days with 100 days suspended was a definite sentence imposed without conditions or a purge clause. Because the sentence was a determinate one, the punishment was criminal in nature, and it could not be imposed unless federal constitutional protections were applied in the contempt proceeding. Defendant's determinate sentence was clearly criminal in nature. Moreover, he was exposed to a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment thereby meeting the threshold for jury trial eligibility as a constitutional right. The sentence was imposed without appellant having been advised of, or provided with, the constitutional safeguards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant residents challenged a decision from the Third Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lincoln (Louisiana), which dismissed their action against appellees, a city and an applicant, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in a zoning dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's board of aldermen granted variances to Ruston, La., Mun. Code &sect; 29-43(5) (1998) to allow the applicant to construct two cellular phone towers. The residents contended that the city's action in granting the variances was invalid because the ordinance contained no objective standards for allowing a variance. The trial court dismissed the action for failing to follow the procedures in La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1880. It also found that the city's decision was not arbitrary and unreasonable. The residents then sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that article 1880 required service on the state attorney general if an ordinance was alleged to be unconstitutional. Even though the petition did not assert such a claim specifically, the trial court properly found that the claim was based on an assertion of unconstitutionality. Further, the city's board considered the facts and circumstances of the case and exercised their authority honestly and upon due consideration. The considerations were related to the public health, safety, and general welfare. Moreover, a prima facie presumption of validity attached to the zoning body's actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the First Judicial District Court, Caddo Parish, Louisiana, that, on remand, sentenced him for public intimidation in violation of La.

Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, and imposed a life sentence without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's decision granting defendant a judgment of acquittal was reversed and the defendant was sentenced on remand as a second felony habitual offender. The State sought review and the case was again remanded for the trial court to reconsider defendant's habitual offender status because the court of appeals found that the evidence supported his adjudication as a third-felony offender. On remand, the trial court imposed the mandatory life sentence. Defendant appealed, claiming the sentence was excessive and unconstitutional given the facts of his case. On appeal, the court of appeals found that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's adjudication as a third felony offender because the State sufficiently established his two prior felony convictions for a 1985 simple burglary and a 1995 aggravated battery. However, the trial court erred in failing to consider whether the mandatory sentence was constitutional as applied to this defendant using the Johnson factors, such as the use or lack of violence in the current and prior offenses, the more lenient punishment under the amended habitual offender statute, and the burden on taxpayers of housing defendant for life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's the habitual offender adjudication and remanded the case to the trial court for reconsideration of the life sentence imposed in light of the Johnson guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 26th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, Louisiana, convicting him of second-degree murder in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1 and obstruction of justice in violation of La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for beating the victim to death and then disposing of her body. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's second-degree murder conviction because the circumstantial evidence against him was overwhelming. The evidence showed that: (1) defendant rented the motel room where the murder took place; (2) a housekeeper and motel resident saw defendant the day of the murder; (3) connections were made between the brands of cigarettes and condoms found in the motel room and defendant's home; and (4) DNA evidence linked defendant to the victim, including defendant's DNA evidence found in the motel room, the victim's DNA found on defendant's clothing, and the victim's DNA found in the motel room and in defendant's vehicle. The evidence was also sufficient to support defendant's obstruction of justice conviction because the victim's DNA was found on multiple surfaces in the trunk of defendant's vehicle, which matched descriptions of the vehicle at the motel. A detective's testimony that liquid dripped from defendant's trunk clearly suggested that he attempted to clean out the trunk of his vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The Sixteenth Judicial District Court of Iberia Parish, Louisiana, granted summary judgment in favor of the sheriff and the deputy on grounds that they were immune from liability. The former prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the former prisoner contended the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on grounds that the deputy and the sheriff were immune from ordinary negligence under La.

The appellate court disagreed, finding that the former prisoner's injury occurred while he was a prisoner. The injury arose out of participation in the litter abatement program, and the fact that the former prisoner had since been released did not affect the immunity afforded by &sect; 15:708 for injuries arising out of a prisoner's participation in a litter abatement program. Nothing in &sect; 15:708 extended the correctional facility's obligation to provide medical treatment beyond the period of incarceration. And the fact that the accident occurred after the truck's engine died as the deputy drove out into the intersection showed that the accident did not result from gross negligence or an intentional act. As such, no issue of material fact remained as to any negligence, and summary judgment was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

The direct evidence and those reasonably inferred from the circumstantial evidence were sufficient for a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had the specific intent to inflict serious bodily injury on the victim. Defendant was not merely present at the scene. He knowingly participated in the execution of the offense and played an integral part in the completion of the offense. Defendant drove the vehicle while the victim was beaten by his accomplices. Furthermore, defendant dragged the victim out of the vehicle, demanded the victim's property, and forcefully removed the property from the victim while defendant's accomplices viciously beat the victim to prevent his resistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents, who were the biological father and the adoptive mother, sought review of a judgment against them and in favor of the maternal grandparents; the court affirmed in all respects except as to the finding of contempt. Because the trial court failed to render an order reciting the facts constituting the contempt, as was required by La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 225(B), the court reversed the judgment insofar as it held the parents in contempt of court and ordered them to pay a $ 1,000.00 fine, plus costs and attorney fees, and granted the grandparents seven make-up visitation days with the child. The court further held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:344 could be interpreted in a constitutional manner; thus, there was no error in the trial court's determination that &sect; 9:344 was constitutional on its face. The specificity of the trial court's judgment demonstrated its awareness of the parents' constitutionally protected fundamental right to raise the child as they saw fit and that the grandparents' rights as grandparents were ancillary to the parents' rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidates qualified as candidates for assessors in municipal elections. Each candidate included the initials &quot;I.Q.,&quot; which stood for &quot;I quit,&quot; in their names. The trial courts ruled in both cases that &quot;I.Q.&quot; was not a permissible &quot;nickname&quot; but was an impermissible &quot;designation&quot; under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:463. The candidates argued that the trial court erred in finding that &quot;I.Q.&quot; was not a permissible nickname and impermissibly construed &sect; 18.463 as prohibiting political speech in a candidate's name on the ballot in violation of the candidates' First Amendment rights. The candidates admitted that they only started using the &quot;I.Q.&quot; moniker several weeks before qualifying for their respective races and that &quot;I.Q.&quot; was to inform voters that they would take no salary and work for the contraction of the number of assessors from seven to one. The court found that &quot;I.Q.&quot; pointed out to voters what the candidates would have done if they were elected. Thus there was nothing manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong with the trial court's rulings. The constitutional claims were not reviewable because they were not raised before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (Department), filed a writ application seeking review of the decision of the 20th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Feliciana (Louisiana), which denied an exception of prescription in respondent inmate's action for damages that he allegedly sustained as a result of being struck by another inmate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed an action for damages and the Department filed a peremptory exception of prescription, seeking dismissal of the suit with prejudice. Therein, the Department argued that the inmate failed to timely file an administrative claim for relief pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1172. The district court denied the exception and the Department filed a timely writ application. The court granted the writ, stating that the district court used the term &quot;interruption&quot; in regard to prescription, whereas the relevant statute,&nbsp;&sect; 15:1172(E), used the term &quot;suspension&quot; in regard to liberative prescription. Further, in briefs, the inmate argued that he had one year subsequent to delivery of the final agency decision on May 7, 2004, to file suit. In that sense, he appeared to argue that prescription was interrupted until May 7, 2004. The district court erred in finding that the statute provided for the interruption, rather than suspension, of the prescriptive period for delictual actions. Since the court believed that constituted legal error, it granted the writ and vacated the judgment of the trial court dated September 16, 2005.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ and remanded the matter to the district court for proper application of the law to the facts at hand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans parish (Louisiana) that convicted him of manslaughter under La.

The court held that defendant's conviction was supported by sufficient evidence, which included the testimony of pathologist that indicated that defendant struck the victim on head with a flashlight, causing bleeding in her brain that resulted in a coma and her death 2 days later. The court rejected defendant's justification defenses because the justified force provision, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:19, did not apply where the force resulted in a homicide. The court rejected defendant's claim regarding the limited cross-examination of police officers because defendant failed to object and the responses involved speculation, hearsay, matters not within the officer's personal knowledge, or opinion. The court found that defendant's sentence was only slightly longer than the minimum statutory sentence under the Habitual Offender Law, and that his two prior drug offenses could serve as the basis for his sentence as a third-felony offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant attempted to rob a tire repairman of $25.00. He fired a gun at the victim, but it luckily misfired and no one was injured. After he was convicted of two crimes, the trial court considered his extensive juvenile record and other factors when it imposed concurrent forty-five and twenty-year sentences. Defendant then sought review. In affirming, the appellate court determined that the sentences were not excessive under U.S. Const. amend. VIII or La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 because they were not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime. In considering the aggravating circumstances listed under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1(B), the trial court determined that defendant disregarded human life by firing the gun at the victim, and he had an extensive prior record. Further, Apprendi did not prohibit the trial court from considering the juvenile adjudications. In addition, Apprendi did not apply to defendant's situation because he did not receive a penalty that exceeded the statutory maximum. Finally, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim should have been pursued in an action seeking postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several years after defendant mother gave birth, plaintiff ex-boyfriend filed a petition to establish filiation, alleging he was the biological father of the child. The Fourteenth Judicial District Court of Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, denied his plea challenging the constitutionality of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 191 and granted the mother's exceptions of no cause of action, no right of action, and prescription. The ex-boyfriend appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the ex-boyfriend again challenged the unconstitutionality of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 191, asserting that the retroactive application of the peremptive period set out in art. 191 unconstitutionally deprived him of a vested right. The appellate court agreed, finding that prior to the passage of 2004 La. Acts 530 (which created La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 191), Louisiana courts traditionally recognized a biological father's right to his illegitimate child by means of an avowal action. Therefore, at the time the ex-boyfriend filed his suit, he had a vested right to sue to avow paternity. Accordingly, retroactive application of art. 191 was an unconstitutional abridgement of a right to due process. And as an action for avowal was not subject to a prescriptive period under the law in effect at the time the petition was filed, the trial court could not grant judgment on the mother's exceptions based on the timeliness of the ex-boyfriend's petition. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting the mother's exceptions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment denying the plea of unconstitutionality was reversed. The trial court's judgment granting the mother's exceptions was reversed, and the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's father died in a car accident the day before the final judgment of his divorce from appellant mother.

The Thirty-Sixth Judicial District Court of Beauregard Parish, Louisiana, rendered judgment granting visitation to the grandparents. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the mother contended the trial court abused its discretion in the amount of visitation awarded the grandparents and in failing to place special weight on the mother's visitation preference who was not proven to be or challenged as an unfit parent. She also argued that the trial court erred in applying La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:344 and in failing to apply and address the provisions of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 136. The appellate court agreed that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;9:344 was inapplicable as the father's death did not occur while he was married; the fact that the judgment of divorce was not signed by the trial court until the day following his death was of no consequence. The trial court should have applied La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 136. The appellate court also agreed with the mother that the trial court's visitation award was excessive, especially considering the fact that they were awarded more time with the child than the father was.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparent's visitation award was reduced and the visitation schedule was amended; as amended, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Ninth Judicial District Court of Rapides Parish, Louisiana, convicted defendant of aggravated rape, aggravated burglary, and first degree robbery. He was sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for the rape, to 40 years without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for the robbery, and to 30 years at hard labor for the burglary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the verdicts of guilty of aggravated rape and aggravated burglary were unconstitutional because they imposed multiple punishments for a single act. He also contended the aggravated rape conviction was not sustainable because there was no evidence of a weapon or use of a weapon during the commission of the crime. The appellate court disagreed, holding first that the State did not need to present evidence that defendant used a weapon to be convicted of aggravated rape; the fact that the victim was 77-years-old at the time of the rape was sufficient to support this conviction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42. And based on the Blockburger test, double jeopardy did not exist as the crimes of aggravated rape and aggravated burglary each required proof of an additional element different from the other. Defendant could have been convicted of aggravated rape without proof that an aggravated burglary occurred; he could also have been convicted of aggravated burglary without proof that a rape occurred, considering the fact that he committed a battery upon the victim when he struck her in the arm and armed himself with a club.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed but the case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to amend the sentencing minutes to reflect that the trial court sentenced defendant to 30 years at hard labor for aggravated burglary and to order the sentence imposed for first degree robbery to be served without benefit of parole.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged that his due process and equal protection rights were violated by not being granted a timely work release.

For such complaints, the inmate was required to exhaust the administrative remedy procedure which governed those complaints before filing suit in district court. The inmate was approved for work release in August 2004. The first correspondence from the inmate was dated October 18, 2004 asking for assistance in getting a work release. The inmate wrote the warden or assistant warden four more times asking for assistance of some sort though December 1, 2004. Of note, none of the letters contained the phrase &quot;This is a Request for Administrative Remedy,&quot; pursuant to La. Admin. Code tit. 22, &sect; XI.325(F)(2)(a) and (b) (2005). The inmate filed suit on November 15, 2004. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the inmate's complaint because it was clear that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies before filing suit as required by La. Rev. Stat.

Throughout the prosecution of his case, defendant filed numerous pretrial pro se briefs with the trial court. The trial court granted defendant hearings on several of his pretrial pro se motions, and upon his request, allowed defendant to personally argue his motions. At defendant's arraignment, the State read the bill of information. The bill of information included the elements that the State intended to prove at trial. After being advised of the elements of the offenses, defendant stated that he understood both of the charges. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court discussed defendant's prior extensive experience with the judicial process. Defendant was a fifth felony offender with a record dating back to 1983. Based on his prior extensive experience with the criminal justice system, defendant was aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a Catholic priest, sought review of the decision of the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Mary (Louisiana), which convicted him of 15 counts of possession of pornography involving juveniles in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.1, after his plea of guilty. He was sentenced to 10 years at hard labor for each of the counts, to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendant's motion to quash and sentenced him to 10 years at hard labor for each of the 15 counts of child pornography. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences, stating that at issue in the case was the legality of imposing separate sentences on defendant for convictions of 15 counts that were charged separately in a single bill of information. The court stated that a careful reading of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.1 revealed that the legislative intent was to proscribe possession of any single image. The use of the plural form was clearly a matter of grammatical style and not suggestive of an intent to establish a unit of prosecution based upon a broad course of conduct involving multiple contraband images. Thus, defendant's emphasis upon the plural form of the contraband items was misplaced. The court further concluded that the sentences imposed were not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense. Because defendant made no objection when the trial court imposed fines, the issue was barred on appeal pursuant to La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 103(A)(1) and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 841.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate sought review of an order from the Seventh Judicial District Court, Parish of Catahoula (Louisiana), which granted exceptions and motions filed by defendants, a correction center, a warden, a captain, and an officer, and struck his habeas corpus petition without prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The trial court granted defendants' exceptions and struck the inmate's pleadings without prejudice. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in dismissing the petition as premature because there was no showing that an adequate administrative remedy was available. A review of the inmate's pleadings indicated that he never had the opportunity to adjudicate the merits of his claim for the return of his personal effects, including his law books. The trial court dismissed his complaint for failure to pursue administrative remedies, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1184(A)(2), without reaching the question of whether prison officials prevented him from pursuing those remedies. Further, the trial court erred in dismissing the petition pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 891 because the pro se petition was sufficient to alert defendants of the causes of action alleged. Finally, the trial court erred in dismissing the petition pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1184(B) because the allegations were not frivolous, did not fail to state a cause of action, and did not meet any other criteria for dismissal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order granting defendants' exceptions. The court reversed the order granting defendants' motion to strike, except as to any monetary references in the petition. The court remanded the case for a hearing and ruling on the issue of the inmate's right to pursue mental anguish damages and punitive damages. The court ordered that the inmate be afforded access to the law library or be provided legal assistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted him, by a guilty plea, of possession of more than 60 pounds of marijuana in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(F)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his guilty plea and sentence, but the court affirmed. The court stated that the officers had probable cause sufficient to justify a warrantless arrest when they entered the recording studio. By that time, the confidential informant had purchased marijuana from defendant inside the studio and told the officers that he had seen additional marijuana there. The officers also arrested a man immediately after he left defendant's studio who had marijuana in his possession. The officers were concerned that defendant had been alerted to their surveillance activity. Due to defendant's nervous behavior, the officers believed that he was aware of their presence and was destroying evidence. Based on that, the court found that there were exigent circumstances sufficient to support a valid entry. When officers approached defendant outside of his business, they had probable cause to arrest him for distribution of marijuana. When defendant attempted to elude the officers by fleeing into his studio and locking the door, the officers were within their authority to enter the building pursuant to the Fourth Amendment and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 5 to complete the arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and remanded with instructions to the trial judge to send written notice to defendant within 10 days of the rendition of the opinion of the correct statement of the law regarding the prescriptive period for postconviction relief, and to file written proof in the record that defendant received the notice.</SPAN></P>

Case No. 502,311. The Honorable Janice Clark, Judge Presiding.  <BR>Wooley v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 893 So. 2d 746, 2005 La. LEXIS 142 (La., Jan. 19, 2005)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Commissioner of Insurance sought declaratory relief seeking a determination that 1995 La. Acts 739 and 1999 La. Acts 1332 were unconstitutional; the trial court held the Acts unconstitutional. Defendant insurance company appealed directly to the Supreme Court of Louisiana, which remanded the matter to determine if the Commissioner had the right to declaratory relief on the issue of whether a form complied with applicable laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance company had sought approval of a form. The Commissioner had disapproved of the form, but an administrative law judge (ALJ) approved the form over the Commissioner's objection, and the Commissioner sought judicial review. A trial court ruled that the Commissioner had no right to judicial review, based upon La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 49:964(A)(2) and 49:992(B)(3). The Commissioner then filed the present action. The appellate court determined that the Commissioner had no right to seek declaratory relief in a situation where the insurance company had only sought administrative approval of the form and a challenge to the form had not arisen out of a concrete factual situation because the legislature's enactment of &sect;&sect; 49:964(A)(2) and 49:992(B)(2) and (B)(3) unequivocally restricted the Commissioner's authority to seek judicial review of the ALJ's adverse adjudication of the issue presented to him. As the administrative approval of insurance forms were not civil matters within La. Const. art. 5, &sect;&nbsp;16(A), the issue was not within the original jurisdiction of the court. Thus, there was no justiciable controversy that allowed the Commissioner to seek declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two men, claimed to be the illegitimate children of the deceased and filed petitions to intervene in his succession. Appellee representative filed exceptions of prescription and no cause/no right of action. The Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), found former La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 209, regarding proof of filiation, applicable and sustained the exceptions and dismissed the petitions. The men appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the appeals were pending, the Louisiana Legislature enacted La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 197 which was effective in 2005, and which changed the law regarding the time period for bringing a paternity action. Formerly, La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 209C provided for the time limits for proving filiation. At the time the instant petitions were filed, one of the men was 54 years old and the other was 36 years old. Obviously, they were well beyond 19 years old and their claims for filiation had long prescribed under former art. 209, which had required that any proceeding had to have been brought within 19 years of their birth. Although the men claimed that the trial court erred in finding that former art. 209 was constitutional, its constitutionality was clearly upheld by the Louisiana Supreme Court in Succession of Grice. Based on Grice, the appellate court agreed with the trial court's ruling that former art. 209 was constitutional and therefore, that finding foreclosed the constitutional attacks of the men. Nor had the appellate court found any &quot;clear and unequivocal&quot; expression by the legislature that new La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 197 revived filiation claims that had already prescribed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Costs of the appeal were to be shared equally between the two children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant appealed the decision of the Office of Workers' Compensation, District 4 (Louisiana), to dismiss her disputed claim for compensation pursuant to appellee employer's motion for summary judgment. The court found that no question of fact remained but that the claimant violated the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208 by misrepresenting her condition to obtain workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer alleged that the claimant made numerous misrepresentations as to previous injuries and her pre-accident physical condition in depositions and that surveillance videos showed that she was able to perform tasks she previously denied being able to do. The appellate court noted that while the video surveillance tapes showed the claimant doing tasks which she stated she was unable to do, they also showed occasions on which she appeared to be in pain and unable to function normally. The WCJ stated in her oral reasons for judgment that the claimant made deliberate misrepresentations about her injuries in order to bolster her compensation claim. The WCJ also stated that there were some cases where she felt that she needed to see the witness to judge the credibility. But that it was sufficiently documented in the instant case that the claims were &quot;more than puffery or exaggeration.&quot; In light of the contradictory evidence and the WCJ's credibility evaluation with regard to the claimant's motive or intent, the appellate court found that summary judgment was not appropriate. A material issue of fact remained as to whether willful misrepresentations were made to obtain benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. The case was remanded. Costs of the appeal were assessed to the employer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens appealed a decision of the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Martin (Louisiana), which granted defendant property owners' exceptions of no cause and no right of action to survey and fix boundaries at the high water mark along privately-owned lands. Plaintiffs added the State as a defendant and sought mandamus compelling the State to bring a boundary action against the owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were individuals who navigated the waters of a basin for commercial and recreational purposes. They claimed that the owners impeded plaintiffs' servitude and right of public access to waters and banks subject to public use under La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 456 and 784, et seq., and La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3691. The court held that on the face of the petition, there was not a cause of action for the kind of &quot;boundary&quot; that plaintiffs sought to fix in that it was not a traditional boundary between contiguous lands. Plaintiffs did not have a right of action to fix such boundaries because plaintiffs were not owners, lessors, lessees, legal or conventional usufructuaries, or adverse possessors of the properties at issue. As to mandamus, there was no indication of even a discretionary basis for the State to fix such boundaries. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41:1701.1B(4) did not impose the burden of suing numerous landowners to fix boundaries not required by law. Further, the request for declaratory judgment essentially sought to compel the State to declare rights not adjudicated. Plaintiffs had no standing to compel the State to make such broad declarations on their behalf.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to suppress alleging that the evidence was obtained as a result of an unconstitutional stop. The Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier (Louisiana) denied defendant's motion. Defendant was subsequently convicted of possession of marijuana and resisting an officer. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Enforcement agent stopped a vehicle driving through a wildlife management area (WMA) to determine if the occupants had obtained a permit to conduct activities in the WMA. The stop led to further investigation in which the agent learned that marijuana was in the vehicle. The agent told a sleeping passenger, defendant, to get out of the vehicle. He then attempted to flee the scene. The agent chased and apprehended him. The agent testified that the reason he stopped the vehicle was that he did not see a self-clearing permit on the dashboard, but the regulations did not require such a permit if the vehicle was simply passing through the WMA. The stop appeared to be arbitrary or discretionary on the part of the agent and constituted an invasion of privacy. Thus, the stop violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition against warrantless searches and seizures, and violated the La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5 right against invasions of privacy. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress. Finally, because defendant was not under arrest, he could not be convicted of resisting an officer under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated and set aside defendant's convictions and sentences, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The judgment denying the motion to suppress was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Martin (Louisiana), which convicted him of dogfighting. He was sentenced to one year at hard labor, with a $ 1,000 fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's vehicle was pulled over by a police officer for impeding the flow of traffic. After the driver and defendant were arrested, the officer saw a bleeding dog on the backseat of the vehicle. The officer searched the car, also finding a video camera and a videotape. Upon questioning the driver, the officer learned that he and defendant had engaged in dogfighting. Defendant was charged with dogfighting. The trial court denied his motion to suppress. He pled guilty to the charge. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in notifying defendant verbally, rather than in a written waiver of rights, of the prescriptive period for filing postconviction relief. The notice did not meet the requirements of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 930.8. The record supported a determination that the officer was reasonable in stopping defendant's car where it was stopped at a traffic light next to another vehicle and the occupants of both vehicles were talking. The officer had probable cause to believe that the dog was injured as a result of some criminal activity because the vehicle was stopped in the early morning, defendant seemed intoxicated, and the driver had blood on his pants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court remanded the case with instructions to the trial court to send defendant appropriate written notice of the prescriptive period for filing postconviction relief within 10 days and to file written proof that defendant received notice in the record of the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, several individuals, sued defendants, a parish government (the parish), and the State Land Office. The underlying issue was the boundary between two parishes and the residency of a candidate. Plaintiffs alleged, in part, that defendants relied on inaccurate surveys when determining the boundary. The Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana, held suit was barred by res judicata. Plaintiffs sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The underlying issue, which went back to 1999, had involved a dispute about whether a candidate for the parish government resided within said parish. The first state court lawsuit litigated the eligibility of said candidate. The instant court had held that his home was located in an adjacent parish. The issues in the present suit, as to the validity of an ordinance establishing the boundary, were not raised or litigated in the previous state court action. Moreover, the parish and the State Land Office were not parties to that suit. Plaintiffs had then brought suit in federal court alleging violations of their constitutional rights. However, the issues raised in the instant suit were not litigated in that action. Later, with respect to the ordinance, the trial court rescinded a temporary restraining order and denied a permanent injunction. The judgment was silent with regard to plaintiffs' request for a declaratory judgment as to whether said ordinance was constitutional. Ultimately, plaintiffs filed the instant suit, claiming fraud or mistake on the part of the government officials. Thus, the appellate court found the instant suit was not barred by res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court was reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 19th Judicial District Court, In and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, ordered defendant city to reinstate plaintiff employee to his position at the Department of Public Works (DPW). The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was terminated from his employment with DPW; however, he appealed his termination to the personnel board. After a hearing, the Board members could not agree on an appropriate punishment. Because there were not enough votes to impose either penalty considered, the Board ruled that the employee would be reinstated to his DPW position. Approximately 18 months after the appellate court rendered its original unpublished decision, another panel considered and decided another case. In that appeal, the appellate court decided that city had, by its own charter, limited its recourse as a juridical entity from adverse decisions of its own personnel board. Therefore, neither the district court nor the appellate court had subject matter jurisdiction. To resolve the conflict, the appellate court overruled its decision in the earlier appeal of this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate filed a petition for judicial review of the administrative decision recalculating his sentence after his parole was revoked after he was found guilty of a crime committed after he had been released on parole. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) dismissed the inmate's suit for judicial review, assigned a strike, and assessed costs against him. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was originally convicted and sentenced to a total of 15 years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. At the time he was sentenced, former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.14 was in effect. As a result of the revocation, he was required to serve the remainder of his original sentence due at the time of his release; i.e., approximately seven and a half years in addition to the new five-year sentence. The inmate claimed that the court erred in not restoring his earned good-time credits, in retroactively applying newer, more onerous and burdensome versions of &sect;&sect; 15:571.14 and 15:571.4, and in assessing costs to him and assigning a strike against him. Inter alia, the appellate court held that an inmate whose conditional release was revoked upon his conviction for another felony was not entitled to credit against his sentence for time spent free under parole conditions. However, the district court erred in assigning a strike because the Prison Litigation Reform Act's (PLRA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1181-91, strike provisions did not apply because the inmate was challenging the duration of his custody and not a condition of his confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court dismissing the petition for judicial review without prejudice and assessing costs was affirmed. The portion of the judgment assigning a strike against the inmate was vacated. Costs of the appeal were assessed to the inmate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee attorney and former indigent defender board (IDB) member brought an action to judicially declare the statutes and procedures governing selection of IDB members unconstitutional or otherwise illegal. Appellant State, through judges, filed various exceptions including the exception of no right of action. The First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) denied the exception. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney alleged that the judges, empowered by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;15:144(B), involved themselves in the functioning of the IDB to the extent that by 2003 the judges effectively supervised and controlled the IDB's operations. The attorney claimed that such control violated the separation of powers between different branches of government in violation of La. Const. art. II, &sect; 2. From that he argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:144 et seq., were facially unconstitutional. The appellate court held that it was difficult to imagine what class of plaintiff would have been appropriate to challenge the constitutionality of the statutes setting up a board to represent indigent defendants if the judges' argument was accepted. The attorney was a citizen and certainly could challenge the process. The trial court accurately interpreted La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1872 to require only a minimal threshold for standing for declaratory judgment relief and found that the attorney met the &quot;person interested&quot; requirement for standing under art. 1872. Under his allegation, the attorney had more than an expectation. Thus, the trial court correctly found that the attorney had a right of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions in the Criminal District Court Orleans Parish (Louisiana) for attempted first degree murder under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:27 and 14:30 and felon in possession of a firearm under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer testified that he approached defendant as a suspicious person, and after some confrontation, defendant shot the officer four times. The court held that while defendant and the officer told dramatically different versions of the events, the State's witness could have viewed defendant on his knees as a struggle, and she also testified that others &quot;rooted&quot; defendant on to shoot the fallen officer. The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the officer was acting as a peace officer at the time of the shooting because he was returning from court when he encountered defendant and he was attempting to handcuff defendant when he was shot. Given defendant's testimony that he shot at the officer's head because he was not sure the officer was wearing body armor, this supported a finding that he intended to kill the officer. The trial court properly excluded evidence of a misdemeanor charge against the officer as it happened two years after the shooting, and any possible relevance was substantially outweighed by the potential prejudice. The court remanded for resentencing because the trial court failed to set forth particular reasons for the consecutive sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but vacated the sentences and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which convicted him of manslaughter in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his manslaughter conviction, but the court affirmed, stating that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. There was a combination of physical evidence, both circumstantial and direct, and eyewitness testimony that was sufficient to carry the required burden. Defendant failed to identify specifically what evidence the State failed to provide that would have exculpated him and the record also evidenced that he was afforded time, when requested, to review the witnesses' statement. Thus, a mistrial was not warranted under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 729.5. Testimony based upon a witness's experience as an employee of a retail gun store who had to be generally familiar with firearms laws in order to operate the business was appropriate pursuant to La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 702. Although a witness's alleged confession to a new witness was partially corroborated by the evidence, the overwhelming weight of the evidence showed that defendant, in fact, fired the fatal shot in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita, Louisiana that convicted him of aggravated rape, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42, and that sentenced him to serve the mandatory term of life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed his offense involved minimal force which did not justify punishment in the greater degree as an aggravated rape. The court held that defendant's conviction for aggravated rape was supported by sufficient evidence that showed he forced the victim to perform oral sex on him, she was prevented from resisting the act by threats of great and immediate bodily harm, and that the victim testified that when she attempted to escape, he picked her up and slammed her to the floor. Also La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:41, 42, and 42.1 had been amended to add oral sexual intercourse to the crimes of forcible rape and aggravated rape. The court noted that the difference between aggravated rape and forcible rape was the degree of force employed and the extent to which the victim resisted, and that the determination of the grade of rape was for the jury to decide. The court rejected defendant's Batson challenge where there was nothing in the record that established defendant had made out a prima facie case of discriminatory purpose. The court also held that the mandatory life sentence was not excessive and that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for mistrial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

As to the exception of no right of action/want of interest pursuant La. Code Civ. Pro.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant former employee appealed a judgment from the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, that dismissed his reconventional demand seeking medical expenses, permanent and total disability (PTD) benefits, penalties and attorney fees based on its finding that the employee's medical problems of stroke and ischemic colitis, and his PTD were unrelated to his 1980 work-related heart attack.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed the insurer should have paid his medical expenses for a stroke and colitis and PTD benefits because those conditions were secondary to the same disease process that caused his work-related heart attack in 1980. The trial court did not err in concluding that the employee was not entitled to workers' compensation for medical expenses for his stroke and colitis, and disability benefits where medical experts testified that his medical problems and disability resulted from the progression of his atherosclerotic disease, accelerated by his failure to reduce his risk factors, and were not the result of his heart attack as provided in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1021(8)(a). However, the trial court did err in failing to make findings of fact regarding the employee's claim for reimbursement of the amount the insurer reduced his weekly workers' compensation payments as an offset against his Social Security old-age benefits because the statutory authority for such an offset, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1225(C), had been held unconstitutional. Also, reimbursement of the offset should have been retroactive to when the offset commenced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the part of the trial court judgment that denied the employee's claim for reimbursement of the offset against his Social Security old-age benefits, and amended the judgment to order reimbursement to the employee. The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects and assessed the costs of the appeal to the employer and insurer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In four consolidated actions, appellant State of Louisiana filed writ applications directed to the Criminal District Court of the Orleans Parish No. 3, Louisiana, challenging the order that the State file a petition to have appellee criminal defendants civilly committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue raised by the State in the writ applications was whether the trial court erred when it directed the State to file a petition to have defendants civilly committed. The State argued that defendants' commitment pursuant to the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure was legal, and that the trial court should continue to conduct periodic reviews of defendants' condition pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 648 et seq., without the need for the filing of a new petition. The appellate court ruled that the trial court erred. There was nothing in the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure, in Title 28 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes, or in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:211(A) which required the State to file a formal petition for a civil commitment once the trial court had determined under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 648(B)(3) that a criminal defendant was unlikely in the foreseeable future to regain his capacity to proceed. The statutes had not been amended to impose such a requirement in the years since the trial court first found that the criminal defendants were unrestorably incompetent and dangerous, as required to designate continued commitment as &quot;civil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's writ applications were granted, and the trial court's orders were vacated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which convicted him of the possession of cocaine in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's case involved an appeal regarding the length of the sentence received by him under the Law as it was in effect on November 25, 1998, the date that defendant committed a third offense under the statute. Defendant was sentenced to life in prison without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, and he appealed that sentence as excessive. The court vacated and remanded for resentencing, stating that it found that the imposed sentence at the age of 50 made no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment. It appeared from the face of the record that the life sentence was grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime and the harm to society that it caused. Additionally, defendant would have faced a maximum of 10 years in prison under the current Law, and the court found that on the face of the record, the sentence that he received could have been shocking to the conscience when that fact was considered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. Defendant was to be resentenced after a presentence investigation had been obtained and after the trial court made a determination of whether the minimum sentence in effect at the time defendant committed the crime of possession was constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, (Louisiana) that convicted him of second-degree battery and attempted false imprisonment while armed with a dangerous weapon; and that imposed concurrent 5 year sentences at hard labor on each count with the battery sentence to be served without benefit of parole, pursuant to the firearm enhancement statute,&nbsp;La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that his enhanced sentence without parole eligibility pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.3 for the battery conviction violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under the Apprendi rule. The court noted that the statutory maximum for second-degree battery under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34.1, was 5 years at hard labor with no limit on parole eligibility, and that the firearm enhancement statute,&nbsp;La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.3, merely provided for the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence when a firearm was used. The court held that Article 893.3 did not provide for a separate sentence in addition to the sentence imposed for the battery; therefore defendant's enhanced sentence presented an Apprendi rule violation because it was a more severe sentence than the five-year sentence with no restriction on parole eligibility allowed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34.1. The court held that the trial court, not the jury, found defendant used a firearm in the commission of the battery that resulted in a more severe sentence than the jury's findings alone would have permitted. The court vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, but vacated his sentence on the second-degree battery count and remanded the case for re-sentencing on that count consistent with the opinion. The court affirmed defendant's sentence on the attempted false imprisonment count but directed the trial court to issue a new commitment order consistent with the transcript that reflected parole was not restricted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that a predicate offense was invalid because the ad hoc judge who took his plea in that case was not an elected judge and, hence, did not have authority to accept his plea; and the ad hoc judge in that case failed to properly advise him of his constitutional rights before accepting the guilty plea. Defendant failed to cite any ruling that denied the authority of a duly-appointed ad hoc or pro tempore judge to accept a guilty plea. Defendant argued that the Waiver of Rights form submitted by the State as proof of the predicate conviction revealed that the form failed to include an advisement of defendant's presumption of innocence and/or the fact that the state carried the burden of proving his guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant contended the fact that such an advisement was not contained in the form showed that the ad hoc judge neglected to advise him of that right. Any failure of the court to advise defendant of the presumption of innocence did not invalidate his plea for enhancement purposes. The trial court properly denied his motion to quash. The court was not required to inform defendant that he was presumed innocent until proven guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court In and For the Parish of East Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana, which sentenced him to life imprisonment as a third felony habitual offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 following his conviction of possession of cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(C). Defendant asserted that the statutorily mandated life sentence was unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not file a motion to reconsider the sentence with the trial court. The court noted that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 881.1(E) and 881.2(A)(1), the failure to make such a motion precluded defendant from raising an objection to the sentence on appeal. The court determined that it would nonetheless examine the sentence for excessiveness because it was necessary to do so as part of the analysis of defendant's allegation of ineffective of counsel in failing to file the motion. The court rejected defendant's argument that changes in the Habitual Offender Law required a reduction of his sentence. Without proof that defendant's history was an exceptional one, the prospective change in that law was not enough to justify any downward departure in sentencing. Defendant did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was exceptional to the extent that a mandatory life sentence was not meaningfully tailored to his culpability, the gravity of the offense, and the circumstances of the case. Thus, defendant did not meet his burden of showing that the sentence would have reasonably been different absent defense counsel's failure to file a motion to reconsider sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CONVICTION FOR ONE COUNT OF ARMED ROBBERY REVERSED AND JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL ORDERED; SENTENCES VACATED; REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Twenty-Seventh Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Landry (Louisiana), which convicted him, following a guilty plea, of two counts of armed robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64 and one count of aggravated burglary in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:60 and which ordered him to pay restitution as required by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, along with a co-defendant, kicked down the front door and entered a woman's home. Once inside, defendant took a gun from the woman, while the co-defendant struck another occupant of the home with a bottle of bleach before taking money from her possession. On appeal, the court first noted that the trial court's failure to state the amount of restitution rendered defendant's sentence indeterminate and thus illegal. The court next addressed defendant's argument that the factual basis established at the guilty plea hearing was sufficient to support only one count of armed robbery, rather than two counts as charged. Defendant contended that the only item taken from the woman was a handgun, and that subsequent to his taking of that weapon, no item of value was taken from her. The &quot;taking&quot; upon which the charge of armed robbery was based was the gun taken from the woman. The court first stated that the facts clearly supported the plea of guilty to the charge of aggravated burglary. The court next determined, however, that charging defendant with both aggravated burglary and armed robbery, based upon the same set of facts, clearly violated the &quot;same evidence&quot; test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for one count of armed robbery and ordered a judgment of acquittal entered on the record. The court vacated defendant's sentences for the convictions of the remaining count of armed robbery and aggravated burglary and remanded the case with instructions for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants one and two appealed their convictions and sentences in the Seventh Judicial District Court, Parish of Catahoula (Louisiana). Defendant one was convicted of manslaughter and attempted second degree murder. Defendant two was convicted of second degree murder and attempted second degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were fishing with friends, and an altercation occurred when another party arrived, resulting in the death of one victim and the serious injury of another victim. Defendant one testified that he struck the victim in the back of the head with a piece of wood because the victim, who was intoxicated, was beating up a friend. It was defendant two that had the knife. The court affirmed in part and held that a rational trier could have determined that defendant one's hitting the victim satisfied the requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31(A)(1). As to attempted second degree murder, the court found that it was unlikely that defendant one inflicted any of the injured victim's wounds and further, the evidence established that defendant one's attempts to stab that victim were in response to the victim hitting him. Therefore, the lesser included offense of aggravated battery was appropriate. The court held that considering the location, number, and severity of the wounds, the jury could have inferred that defendant two had the specific intent to kill both victims. There was a lack of physical evidence that one of the victim's tried to drown defendant two.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant one's conviction for manslaughter and reversed his conviction for attempted second degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to one count of possession of methamphetamine, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967. He was sentenced by the 36th Judicial District Court, Parish of Beauregard (Louisiana) to pay a $ 1,000 fine and serve 60 months at hard labor, with 12 months suspended. Defendant was further sentenced to five years of supervised probation after his prison term to be served consecutively to a previous sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that his sentence was excessive. The court considered the &quot;ample consideration&quot; that defendant received in his plea agreement with the State. Defendant received a great benefit through his plea agreement, which reduced his total sentencing exposure from 20 years to 5 years. The district court noted that defendant was a second felony offender. The court's review of the record indicated that defendant previously pled guilty to six counts of distribution of marijuana and one count of possession of marijuana pursuant to a plea agreement in which the State dismissed charges on three counts of possession of a firearm while in possession of marijuana. Maximum sentences should be reserved for the most egregious and blameworthy of offenders. Defendant fell within that category. Defendant alleged that the district court erred in ordering that his sentence should run consecutively to the seven-year sentence he received in 1999.&nbsp;As the district judge clearly designated that the sentences be served consecutively, as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 883, the imposition of consecutive sentences by the district court was not an abuse of its sentencing discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was affirmed. However, regarding the conditions of defendant's probation following his prison term, the matter was remanded, and the district court was instructed to specify a payment schedule for the fees ordered as conditions of defendant's probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of an attempt to create or operate a clandestine laboratory for the unlawful manufacture of a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance (CDS) under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:983. The First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) denied defendant's post-trial motions for new trial, post-verdict judgment of acquittal, and arrest of judgment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant argued that &sect; 40:983 was unconstitutional. The most limiting factor of the defined crime was its requirement for proof of the unlawful manufacture of a CDS. Regardless of the fact that many common household items might be possessed by a person accused of the instant crime, the process of manufacturing, which the state's expert witness described in elaborate detail, entailed a complicated course of conduct. Such conduct demonstrated the intent to manufacture the CDS was much more than possession of common household items. Thus, the illegal activity proscribed by the statute was narrow and gave adequate notice to those who would engage in such manufacturing activities that the conduct was proscribed. The finding that defendant did not conspire to manufacture methamphetamine did not conflict with the finding that he attempted to create or operate a clandestine laboratory with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine. Inter alia, the appellate court also held that because the search of the house appeared to have been primarily limited to common areas, the babysitter had authority or at least apparent authority to give consent to search those areas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guilty plea was entered with the reservation that defendant would be allowed to appeal the denial of the pre-trial motion to suppress. Nevertheless, the grounds raised in the memorandum to support the motion to suppress never included the assertion that the initial stop was illegal. Instead, the basis for the motion to suppress was that the detention after the traffic stop ended was prolonged, and, under the circumstances, the consent was not voluntary. Therefore, the issue was not properly before the appellate court. Nevertheless, the appellate court continued to analyze defendant's argument, and it concluded that a trooper's belief that defendant was in violation of a window tinting statute was sufficient to justify the traffic stop. Further, a video made of the stop indicated that there was no coercion that preceded defendant's consent to search under the totality of the circumstances. As to defendant's sentence, the suspension of a fine was part of the plea bargain, and the trial court specifically found defendant to be indigent; therefore, it was a viable option to decline to impose a fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Board of Directors of the Industrial Development Board of the City of Gonzales, Louisiana, filed a petition for a motion for judgment under the Louisiana Bond Validation Act, La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents owned sporting goods stores; they contended that the use of public funds to finance a competing retail sporting goods store was unconstitutional. The residents further urged that the Tax Increment Financing Act (TIF Act), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:9038.1-.10, did not provide the authority for the project. The appellate court declined to read the TIF Act as limiting governmental assistance to only those aspects of an economic development project falling within the ambit of public works and infrastructure. The TIF Act specifically authorized public assistance to economic development projects involving the private retail industry. As to whether the funding scheme amounted to a donation of public funds prohibited by La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14(A), in this instance the funding was not strictly gratuitous. The residents did not meet their burden of showing that the constitution prohibited legislation that would allow local governments to promote economic development. The residents also made an equal protection challenge, but the TIF Act was rationally related to the legitimate governmental purposes of economic development and enhancement of future revenues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted a defense motion to stay the matter pursuant to Louisiana's Prison Litigation Reform Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1186B(2) (as amended by 2002 La. Acts 1st Ex. Sess. No. 89, &sect; 2), until the inmate paid all court costs accrued after the effective date of the statute's amendment. The inmate argued that the automatic stay provision violated his right of access to the courts as guaranteed by La. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 and was contrary to the equal protection guaranteed in La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. The court found no merit in the inmate's arguments, observing that the automatic stay provision did not affect any suspect class or involve any fundamental right and was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of lessening the burdens presented by nuisance prisoner suits. Thus, the provision neither violated equal protection guarantees nor unconstitutionally impaired a prisoner's right of access to the courts. Moreover, enforcing a stay of litigation as to those costs incurred after the effective date of 2002 La. Acts 1st Ex. Sess. No. 89, &sect; 2 was appropriate and did not constitute an unconstitutional retroactive application of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In January 22, 2004, appellant patient brought a medical malpractice action seeking damages against appellee doctor for treatment rendered in the fall of 1997. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) sustained the doctor's dilatory exception of prematurity and the peremptory exceptions, and dismissed the patient's cause of action with prejudice. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Review of the factual allegations of the petition revealed significant deficiency in factual particularity, particularly as to allegations of facts constituting fraud. Inter alia, the patient failed to allege that the doctor had knowledge of his failure to remove the entire length of the catheter before stating that the procedure was &quot;successful,&quot; when and how the doctor acquired that knowledge, that the misrepresentation was deliberate, and when and how the misrepresentation was made. The relevant circumstances of how the doctor managed to conceal his purported knowledge and to prevent the patient from discovering the alleged malpractice were not alleged with any particularity. Thus, even if those allegations were technically uncontroverted they could not be accepted as true for purposes of determining the issue of prescription. Even if the appellate court generously accepted the date of the alleged malpractice as the last day of fall, the complaint was still instituted almost six years after the date of the alleged malpractice, well beyond both the one-year prescriptive period and the statutory three-year period of repose generally applicable to all claims of medical malpractice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court sustaining the peremptory exception as to the objection of prescription and dismissing the petition of the patient was affirmed, but the judgment was amended in part to vacate that portion of the judgment sustaining the dilatory exception of prematurity and the peremptory exception as to the objection of no cause of action as moot. All costs of the appeal were assessed to the patient.</SPAN></P>

Appellant police department dispatcher slipped on the wet floor and sued the sheriff and appellee, the sheriff's department's insurer. The 32nd Judicial District Court, Parish of Terrebonne (Louisiana) granted summary judgment to the sheriff, dismissing the dispatcher's claims. The dispatcher appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the dispatcher argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:708, which authorized parish sheriffs to allow prisoners to voluntarily perform manual labor in public buildings, was inapplicable. She argued that since the sheriff did not retain custody of the prisoner, the statute did not apply because he should somehow have been in control of the prisoner at all times. Particularly, she argued that the statute was never intended to apply to situations where prisoners performed manual labor or otherwise walked around without supervision by the sheriff's department. The appellate court disagreed and concluded that &sect; 15:708 was applicable. The language of &sect;&nbsp;15:708(A)(1)(a) clearly allowed the sheriff to put prisoners to work performing manual labor in public buildings. Nothing in the language of the statute made the statute inapplicable should the sheriff delegate control of the prisoner to trained officers of a fellow law enforcement agency or to any other person or agency. Applying the plain language of &sect; 15:708, the statute governed authorized labor by prisoners held by a Louisiana sheriff's department.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of purse-snatching in the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana. He was adjudicated a third felony offender and sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. He appealed, asserting that although his sentence was statutorily mandated under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, that same was unduly harsh and unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted that the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, under which defendant was sentenced, had been held constitutional on numerous occasions. Further, to merit a deviation below the mandatory minimum sentence, a defendant had to clearly and convincingly show that he was &quot;exceptional&quot; as downward departures were to occur only in rare instances. In the instant case, defendant did not argue that he was exceptional. Rather, his only contention was that his offenses had not been very violent. However, he had been convicted of simple robbery on two prior occasions, and in the instant matter, he was convicted of purse snatching. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:2(13) specifically enumerated both &quot;purse snatching&quot; and &quot;simple robbery&quot; as &quot;crimes of violence&quot; for purposes of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. In addition, his lengthy criminal history included a variety of felonies. Thus, defendant failed to show that his case was exceptional or extraordinary in any way, or that he deserved a lenient sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, arguing that the university police officer had no jurisdiction off campus, and even if he did, he did not have a reasonable basis to stop defendant. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the one and a half blocks off campus on route to an off-site campus parking lot qualified as being contiguous to the perimeter of the parking lot as well as the main campus, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:1805(A)(3). In considering the reasonableness of the stop at issue in this case, the appellate court noted that this was not a checkpoint stop. Rather, at 11:00 p.m., the officer heard a disturbance of public concern. The officer observed one vehicle leaving the area and stopped that vehicle to ask the occupant and driver what he may have seen or heard. The officer had no intent to arrest or even ticket defendant. There was a public concern, and the intrusion was minimal. As such, there was no discriminatory action.</SPAN></P>

The pipelines of public service companies were assessed by local assessors at 15 percent of fair market value while the public service properties of plaintiffs were assessed at 25 percent of fair market value. The court held that the trial court correctly remanded the matter to the Commission and that on remand, it was within the province of the Commission to correct errors in the appraisal and/or assessment of public service properties under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1837. Plaintiffs filed protests with the Commission and filed the instant suit seeking refund of taxes paid under protest, and the court held that plaintiffs could not now argue that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel precluded reassessment of the properties. Reassessment did not violate plaintiffs' due process rights because they would have ample opportunity to object, if necessary, to the local assessors' valuations. Therefore, the remedy ordered by the trial court was both just and equitable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment to provide that the Commission would issue to plaintiffs a full refund of the taxes paid under protest. The court otherwise affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Appellant taxpayers appealed the judgment of the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Parish of Livingston (Louisiana) in favor of the economic development district, holding that the individual taxpayers' challenge to a resolution proposing the bond issuance, and related proceedings, was untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to strike essentially claimed that the 30-day time limit, provided in La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 35(B) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9038.4L for a challenge to the validity of the bond resolutions and related proceedings, was a peremptive period that had already run before the individual tax payers filed their answer. Thus, their right to challenge was extinguished. The taxpayers conceded that the trial court ruled not on the merits, but on the issue of peremption raised by the motion to strike. Thus, the motion to strike was more akin to a peremptory exception raising the objection of no cause of action or of prescription. Essentially, a hearing on the claim of peremption was held, and the trial court ruled that the challenge was not timely. The appellate court found no violation of due process rights. However, to the extent that the trial court held that a challenge to the legality of the election or elections at issue was perempted, it erred. Such a challenge was timely if brought within 60 days after promulgation of the result of the election pursuant to La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 35(A) because the election occurred more than 30 days after the publication of the resolution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the victims returned home to find defendant in her house without permission. As she tried to escape, defendant grabbed her. Defendant attempted to argue on appeal that the evidence was insufficient; however, the State proved that defendant made an unauthorized entry into the victims' home with the intent to commit a felony or any theft. While in the victims' home, defendant committed a battery upon one of the victims. Although the defendant claimed that he was not the person who committed the crime, the State negated any reasonable probability of misidentification, and established the defendant's identity as the burglar by testimony and physical evidence, including fingerprint identification. The jury obviously rejected defendant's explanation of how his fingerprints were found inside the victims' home. Defendant failed to rebut the presumption that his mandatory minimum sentence was constitutional. Finally, a review of the record did not show that trial counsel's representation fell below the standard of reasonableness and competency as required by prevailing professional standards demanded for attorneys in criminal cases.</SPAN></P>

OFFICE OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION ADMINISTRATION. (NUMBER 02-08224), STATE OF LOUISIANA. HONORABLE ELIZABETH A. WARREN, OWC JUDGE.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;AMENDED AND, AS AMENDED, AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Office of Workers' Compensation Administration (OWC), District 6, (Louisiana) dismissed appellant employee's claim for benefits and granted relief to appellee employer, ordering forfeiture of the employee's right to compensation benefits as a result of his willful misrepresentation of his prior medical history. The employee was also ordered to pay restitution totaling $ 11,130. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that because he was consistent and credible in his testimony about his hemorrhoid problems, the OWC erred in finding he had violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208. The employee fell at work and although he immediately sought treatment for his rectal bleeding, he did not seek treatment for lower back, buttock, and left leg pain until two months later on July 23, 2002. He testified that prior to July 23, 2002, he had never had a problem with or received treatment for hemorrhoids. But the employer submitted medical records showing that beginning in June 1990, he had received medical attention for hemorrhoids. The medical records provided a reasonable factual basis to support the finding that the employee's statement was false and that the misrepresentation was willful and that the employee misrepresented his hemorrhoid history for the purpose of obtaining benefits. His claim for additional benefits associated with his lower back, buttock, and left leg pain exposed him to the risk that if he revealed the history of hemorrhoids, his employer would have denied him medical and indemnity benefits for that claim and sought a refund of what had already been paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the employee's declinatory exception raising the objection of subject matter jurisdiction, the dismissal of his claim for benefits, and the order of forfeiture of workers' compensation benefits were affirmed. That portion of the judgment, awarding the employer restitution was amended to reduce the award. That portion of the judgment awarding the employer $ 500 in attorney fees was reversed. Appeal costs were assessed equally.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with second degree murder. The jury in the 29th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Charles, Division &quot;E&quot; (Louisiana) returned a responsive verdict of guilty of manslaughter, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;14:31. After denying defendant's motion for a new trial and for a post-verdict judgment of acquittal, the trial judge sentenced him to imprisonment at hard labor for 25 years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for new trial or for judgment of acquittal and erred in imposing an excessive sentence. The jury was instructed as to both theories of manslaughter as set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&nbsp;14:31(A). Defendant conceded that &sect; 14:31(A)(2)(a) applied with the intentional misdemeanor being simple battery, when defendant punched the victim in the face while he was being brutally strangled. The doctor who performed the autopsy, testified that the cause of the victim's death was ligature strangulation and denied that he had died as a result of later being dropped from an overpass. The jury could have found the testimony of the doctor who conducted the autopsy more credible than that of defendant's expert. Also, the record reflected that the victim appeared to have been dead prior to his body being thrown over the overpass, as stated in a co-defendant's testimony and recorded statement. Likewise, according to defendant's statement, another co-defendant checked the victim and concluded he was dead before his body was thrown from the overpass. There was sufficient evidence to support the manslaughter conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, asserting the trial court erred in adjudicating him as quadruple multiple offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the due process requirements of the Louisiana Habitual Offender Law, specifically La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, were not complied with. However, the appellate court found that he had filed a motion to quash the multiple bill and a full hearing was held. Thus, the requirements for an arraignment, an opportunity to file objections, and a hearing were met. Secondly, under Apprendi v. New Jersey, a defendant's prior convictions were not required to be submitted to a jury. In addition, all the issues raised by defendant concerning the predicate offenses were properly determined by reviewing the documents submitted in support of the multiple bill. Third, defendant asserted the State failed to prove the sufficiency and validity of his prior guilty pleas. However, the appellate court held that the State met its burden of proving same, his identity thereon (in part through his fingerprint record), and the fact that less than 10 years had elapsed between convictions with respect to &sect; 15:529.1. Finally, defendant failed to preserve the issue of whether his sentence was excessive because he had failed to object and he failed to file a motion to reconsider sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the family members of a deceased patient, brought a survival and wrongful death action against appellee nursing home, claiming the patient sustained a decubitus ulcer and other serious injuries leading to his death as a result of the nursing home's negligence. The 34th Judicial District Court of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, granted the nursing home's exception of prescription. The family appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the family asserted that the trial court erred when it failed to apply the appropriate prescriptive period. In opposition, the nursing home submitted that the family's attempt to classify the claim under Louisiana's Nursing Home Residents' Bill of Rights, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2010.6 et seq., as contractual was incorrect because there had been no showing that a contract between the nursing home and the patient and/or his family ever existed. The appellate court agreed with the nursing home that the family failed to establish their contract claim as there was no evidence that a written contract existed with the patient. Further, because the amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2010.9(C) did not shorten the one-year prescriptive period provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628, there was no disturbance of vested rights in the retroactive application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2010.9(C). The family was aware of the patient's claim on January 8, 1999 when he was removed from the nursing home. Applying either statute, the family's cause of action against the nursing home prescribed in January of 2000. The petition for damages filed in May of 2001 was, therefore, untimely.</SPAN></P>

HONORABLE ROBERT EDWARD BURGESS, DISTRICT JUDGE.  <BR>Plainview Area Ass'n v. State, 900 So. 2d 837, 2005 La. LEXIS 1257 (La., Apr. 29, 2005)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State appealed a judgment of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Parish Of Sabin (Louisiana) requiring it to maintain a road. The matter was remanded. The trial court again found in favor of plaintiffs, a citizens association. The State filed a suspensive appeal. The court transferred the matter to the supreme court, which vacated the judgment and remanded the case for a ruling on the merits of the appeal from the original judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued, in part, that it was no longer responsible for the road's maintenance because La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 27 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:757 prohibited the expenditure of state funds on roads that were not part of the state highway system. The association claimed that the State was responsible for the road according to an agreement entered into just before its construction and that La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 27, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:757&nbsp;unconstitutionally impaired those obligations. On appeal, the court agreed that the trial court erred in finding that the road was part of the state highway system. The court noted that the road had never been assigned a state highway number nor was it referenced by the statute establishing the system. Furthermore, the association conceded at oral argument that the road was not part of the system. The court's finding that the road was not part of the state highway system made the constitutionality issue determinative of the matter. Because the court could not address the constitutionality issue on its own, it remanded the case to the trial court so that the association could specifically plead the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court so that the association could specifically plead the constitutionality issue.</SPAN></P>

NO. 02-3286, DIVISION &quot;J&quot;. HONORABLE STEPHEN J. WINDHORST, JUDGE PRESIDING.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;CONVICTION, FINDING AS A SECOND FELONY OFFENDER AND ENHANCED SENTENCE AFFIRMED; CASE REMANDED.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for possession of Diazepam (Valium), by the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana. The State filed a habitual offender bill of information charging him as a second felony offender. The trial court then vacated his initial five-year sentence, and re-sentenced him to an enhanced sentence of 10 years imprisonment at hard labor. Defendant's motion to reconsider was denied and he then appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found not guilty as to heroin charges. The facts showed that officers conducted surveillance on defendant. They observed what appeared to be a narcotics sale in a parking lot. They stopped the other driver, she had heroin and Valium, and she implicated defendant. Hours later, defendant's residence was searched. Defendant was not home and only Valium was recovered, but there was evidence of other drug related activity. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that counsel's failure to file notice of his alibi defense, that he was out of town at the time of the alleged crime, was ineffective assistance. That was because defendant was not in the residence at the time of the search. Further, he was not convicted based on conduct related to the parking lot transaction. In any event, he was equivocally identified by the narcotics agents. Thus, he suffered no prejudice. Finally, defendant's sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive of grossly disproportionate. His sentence was a maximum, but the trial court was able to consider the heroin charges even though he was acquitted in that respect. The same was true to a past drug arrest where the case was refused.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed. However, the case was remanded for the trial court to advise defendant, by written notice, of the prescriptive period for filing an application for post-conviction relief. The trial court was directed to then to file written proof in the record that defendant received said notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant company appealed from a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff, the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association (LIGA), denying company's summary judgment motion, and ordering the company to pay LIGA $ 25,457 for reimbursement for benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found the Louisiana Legislature intended for LIGA to be able to seek recovery from an insured for any claim it paid on behalf of the insured whose net worth exceeded 25 million dollars on December thirty-first of the year immediately preceding the date of the determination of the insolvency of the insurer. To have held otherwise would have rendered La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1382(D) meaningless and would have thwarted the purpose of the statute, to avoid financial loss to a claimant because of the insolvency of an insurer. Moreover, 2004 La. Acts 109, amending La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1382(D), correcting a typographical error by replacing the last letter of the word insured with an &quot;r&quot; thereby changing the word to &quot;insurer,&quot; as was clearly intended, and deleting the word &quot;covered&quot; in reference to what claims LIGA can seek reimbursement, the amendment was interpretive or curative. Finally, the appellate court rejected the company's argument that &sect; 22:1382(D) was unconstitutional because it discriminated as to wealth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed but amended to delete an award of attorney fees for LIGA.</SPAN></P>

The Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of Claiborne, Louisiana, denied relief, and the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had sued the warden for money damages alleging he sustained medical problems due to exposure to contaminated water. The trial court dismissed the inmate's claim, and the inmate sought review. The trial court granted the warden's motion to enforce the automatic stay in &sect; 15:1186(B)(2) pending payment of the court costs by the inmate. The inmate claimed &sect; 15:1186(B)(2) was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed the constitutionality of &sect; 15:1186(B)(2) as it furthered a legitimate state interest in reducing court congestion by reducing the number of frivolous lawsuits filed by inmates. The appellate court also held that &sect; 15:1186(B)(2) did not violate La. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 9, 22 as the inmates did not have a fundamental constitutional right to sue for civil damages, and their access to the courts could be restricted if there was a rational basis for the restriction. Finally, the court approved the retroactive application of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1186(B)(2) as &sect; 15:1186(B)(2) was procedural as it prescribed a method for operation of the in forma pauperis proceedings by prisoners under the PLRA, and thus, could be applied both retroactively and prospectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court declaring that the automatic stay provision was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee filed a claim when her workers' compensation benefits were reduced to reflect the receipt of her old age benefits as per La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1225(C)(1), a section that was later declared unconstitutional. The Office of Workers' Compensation of District 1W, Caddo Parish, Louisiana, found that appellee employer was only obligated to reinstate benefits retroactive to the date of judicial demand. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the employee challenged the trial court's finding as to when the date of reimbursement should have been. The appellate court found that the employer's assertion that full benefits should only have been restored to the date of judicial demand was untenable considering that it was possible for the employer to receive a credit for benefits paid prior to seeking judicial enforcement of an offset under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1225(C)(1). Further, retroactive application to the date of the commencement of the offset would not have promoted inequity as reimbursing the employee for the benefits that she would have received absent the offset simply allowed her to receive the full benefits to which she was entitled. As such, the trial court erred in denying the employee a reimbursement of the offset benefits retroactive to the date the offset commenced. However, the employee was not entitled to penalties and attorney fees under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1201 because, at the very least, the employer reasonably controverted the employee's demand for complete reimbursement, and the legal dispute was not frivolous as the jurisprudence was not dispositive of the issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That portion of the judgment denying the employee's claim for reimbursement of all benefits offset retroactive to the date the offset was commenced was reversed. The remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, stating that the application of &sect; 9:5628 did not violate the patient's due process rights pursuant to La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, or equal protection rights pursuant to La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On November 12, 2002, the State filed a bill of information charging defendant with video voyeurism, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:283. On March 23rd, the day set for trial, the State entered a nolle prosequi. The case was reinstated on April 16th and defendant pleaded not guilty. The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section &quot;K&quot; (Louisiana) granted defendant's motion to quash on June 23, 2004. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State cited La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 691 and 576 for the propositions that the district attorney had the power to dismiss a bill of information and reinstitute a new prosecution based on the same facts unless the dismissal was made to avoid the time limitations for commencement of trial established by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 578. The motion to quash was granted on June 23, 2004, more than 4 months before the statutory 2-year time limit elapsed. Thus, it did not appear that the State entered a nolle prosequi to avoid statutory time limitations. Twenty months elapsed between the filing of the original bill of information and the granting of defendant's motion to quash. That period of delay was &quot;presumptively prejudicial&quot; under the first factor of Barker, necessitating further analysis. Under the Wingo factors: (1) the length of the delay was presumed prejudicial; (2) the State bore more of the responsibility for the delay; (3) defendant did not object to the delay or file a motion for a speedy trial; and (4) he was inconvenienced by having to travel for court appearances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) of possession of cocaine. He was found to be a third-felony habitual offender and was sentenced to serve five years in prison without credit for time served. The sentence also provided for a jail term in the even of default of the payment of court costs. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially stopped for reckless driving. A pat-down of defendant revealed cocaine. Defendant was convicted as charged and the court affirmed on appeal. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 703. The pat-down of defendant pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 215.1 was justified because defendant appeared to be on drugs and the officer was concerned for his safety. Defendant's oral consent, given twice, to the search of his pocket was freely given, which justified the search. Because of defendant's outstanding warrants, the cocaine would have been discovered without reference to any alleged police error or misconduct, and therefore, even if revealed during an illegal search, the evidence was have been admissible under the inevitable discovery rule. The trial court erred in ordering defendant to serve 10 days in jail if he defaulted on the payment of court costs because defendant was indigent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court amended defendant's sentence to delete the portion that provided for a jail term in the event of default of the payment of court costs. As amended, the court affirmed defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208(D). The employer made willful misrepresentations in an attempt to defeat the employee's claim. In a civil proceeding, the Nineteenth Judicial District, East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, upheld the constitutionality of the statute and found the employer liable for the civil penalties. The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sustained a job-related injury during the course of his employment with a grocery store. His employer denied the accident and responsibility for the claim. The workers' compensation court awarded the employee benefits. An additional civil penalty of $ 5,000.00 was assessed against the employer, because the operator and sole stockholder of the grocery store made intentional misrepresentations in his court testimony, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208(A). In a civil appeal, the employer argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208 was unconstitutional in that it improperly authorized the judge to exercise criminal jurisdiction in a workers' compensation proceeding. The appellate court disagreed. The penalty provided by &sect; 23:1208(D) was civil, not criminal. Therefore, &sect; 23:1208 was not unconstitutional. The court's assessment of civil penalties under &sect; 23:1208(D) was related to the judicious administration of workers' compensation claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sought review of an order from the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Vermilion (Louisiana), which dismissed as premature her action to have La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208(E) declared unconstitutional and to have the court issue an injunction preventing defendant State of Louisiana from enforcing the statute in her workers' compensation case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a claim for workers' compensation benefits. However, before her claim was litigated, the employee filed suit in the trial court, seeking to have &sect; 23:1208(E) declared unconstitutional and to have the trial court issue an injunction preventing the State from enforcing the statute. The trial judge dismissed the employee's suit as premature. On appeal, the court determined that because the employee's workers' compensation claim had not yet been litigated, she had not been adversely impacted by the statute that she sought to have declared unconstitutional. There was a possibility that if the court waited, the whole constitutional problem might be eliminated by later developments. If the workers' compensation judge was to determine that the employee had not violated the statute, the issue of the constitutionality of the statute would be moot. Accordingly, the issue raised by the employee was not ripe for determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city council candidate brought suit against defendants, the State via the attorney general and a parish court clerk, challenging an election. The attorney general and the clerk filed peremptory exceptions of no cause of action, prescription, and peremption. The Fourteenth Judicial District Court of Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, granted the exceptions of prescription and dismissed the candidate's suit. The candidate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the candidate contended that the time limitation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1405(B) was unconstitutional and, therefore, should not have been applied to bar her action. The appellate court disagreed, finding that this provision had previously been upheld as constitutional. Furthermore, there was no conflict between the time delays for the promulgation of election returns as forth in &sect; 18:1405 and the time delays for challenging elections pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:574. Nor was La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1405 ambiguous as to the date on which the delay for filing the action began to run as the statute clearly stated that the nine-day delay commenced to run on the day following the conducting of the election. Notwithstanding the candidate's contention that the language of the Election Code was confusing, the appellate court found that the wording of &sect; 1405(B) was clear and free of any ambiguity or vagueness. As the time period set forth in &sect; 1405(B) was peremptive, the trial court correctly dismissed the candidate's suit with prejudice as her claim ceased to exist prior to the filing of her petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals in a summary tax proceeding, appellant city challenged judgments of the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) that granted respondent hospital's reconventional demand for a refund of overpaid sales and use taxes; denied the city's claim for taxes on immovable property; and that denied the city's claim for penalties on the unpaid taxes under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1602. The hospital also appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city challenged the grant of the hospital's reconventional demand for a refund of overpaid taxes. The hospital challenged the grant of the city's claim for audit costs pursuant to New Orleans, La., City Code 150-707 and for attorney fees. It also challenged the calculation of sales taxes assessed on the service and repair contracts for immovable property, which consisted of computerized tomography equipment and a radiation therapy simulator. The court held that reconventional demands were not permitted in tax collections cases because of the sui generis nature of the summary proceedings and because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:337.61, which required that all defenses be filed prior to the time fixed for the hearing, would preclude a tax collector from filing an answer or defenses to the demand. The city was authorized to impose a penalty on delinquent taxes and that the limiting language in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1602 did not mean that no penalty could be imposed. The court held that New Orleans, La., City Code &sect; 150-441 expressly deemed &quot;tangible personal property&quot; to include certain immovables for the purpose of the imposition of sales taxes on the sale of services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment granting the hospital's reconventional demand for a refund of taxes and dismissed the demand. The court reversed the denial of the city's claims for penalties on the unpaid taxes and the city's claim for taxes on immovable property and remanded the case for a determination of the exact amount of the judgment against the hospital. The court affirmed the grant of the city's request for audit costs and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:89(A)(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional and struck the offending portions without nullifying the statute in its entirety. The organization appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization argued that the trial court erred by failing to declare &sect; 14:89(A)(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional in its entirety and in refusing to declare La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 12:1041&nbsp;unconstitutional. It argued that the trial court erred in attempting to sever the phrases in &sect; 14:89(A)(1) and rewriting the statute so that the only part of paragraph (A)(1) that remained was the portion prohibiting &quot;unnatural carnal copulation&quot; with an animal. The organization argued that the human/animal clause was not severable from the human/human clause and that the entire &sect; 14:89(A)(1) should have been struck down. The Louisiana Supreme Court's discussion of that conduct in Thomas contrasted compensated versus uncompensated conduct because Thomas involved persons charged with performing human-on-human acts for compensation. The court's language did not prohibit severance of the prohibition of human-on-human conduct from that of human-on-animal conduct within &sect; 14:89(A)(1). The appellate court concluded that the two types of behavior were severable, because the prohibition against the human/human portion could be removed without affecting the validity or intent of the human/animal prohibition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Fortieth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. John the Baptist (Louisiana) of two counts of distribution of cocaine in a drug free zone, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:967(A) and 40:981.3, and one count of distribution of cocaine, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A). Defendant was sentenced to consecutive terms on the three counts. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold cocaine to an undercover officer on three occasions. On appeal, the court found that the jury, within its right, apparently chose to believe a detective's uncontradicted testimony in estimating that two of the transactions occurred between 150 to 200 feet from a Catholic school. The jury could have reasonably inferred that a parking lot at issue was the school parking lot and, thus, used for school purposes. The fact that the parking lot might also have been used by a church did not negate its use for school purposes. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request to add co-counsel on the second day of the trial after the completion of voir dire and the testimony of witnesses. Additionally, it appeared that the request for co-counsel may have been for abusive delay. Finally, the trial court sentenced defendant on the same day it denied his second or third motion for a new trial. Thus, the trial court failed to observe the mandatory 24-hour time delay pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 873. Because defendant challenged his non-mandatory sentences as excessive, defendant had to be re-sentenced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed, the sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the 25th Judicial District Court, Parish of Plaquemines (Louisiana) to two counts of carjacking, one count of attempted armed robbery, two counts of aggravated battery, and two counts of armed robbery, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:64.2, 14:27, 14:64, 14:34. Defendant was sentenced to 30 years for the armed robbery counts and to lesser sentences for the other crimes. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that his counsel was ineffective because his counsel failed to move to withdraw the guilty pleas prior to sentencing. The court reversed defendant's conviction for attempted armed robbery and vacated this sentence, but otherwise affirmed. Because the indictment did not specify that defendant was armed with a dangerous weapon, it was an error patent to convict him for the crime of attempted armed robbery under La. Rev. Stat. Ann.&nbsp;&sect;&sect; 14:27, 14:64 when the crime described in the bill of information was that of simple robbery under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:65. The error was not harmless because defendant pleaded guilty to a more serious offense than that alleged in the indictment. The court addressed defendant's claim of error related to ineffective assistance of counsel even though the court was not required to do so. Defendant's contention that his counsel was ineffective for failing to move to withdraw guilty pleas that, according to defendant, did not exist, was without merit. The trial court did not abuse its discretion under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 559.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's attempted armed robbery conviction and vacated defendant's related sentence. All other convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Trial Court No. 040796. Honorable Hamilton S. Winters, Judge.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate brought a medical malpractice action against appellee state university hospital and a doctor. They filed an exception of improper venue asserting that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1184, exclusive venue for a tort action by an inmate was the parish where the inmate was incarcerated when the cause of action arose. The Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana) granted the exception. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed the court erroneously granted appellees' exception. When read in isolation, &sect; 15:1184F supported the trial court's grant of the exception of improper venue. But, the provision could not be read in isolation, it had to be read in the context of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1181-1191. The title of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1184 was &quot;suits by prisoners,&quot; indicating that it addressed only those lawsuits that fit the definition of a &quot;prisoner suit&quot; under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1181(2). Reading La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1184(F) in context lead to the conclusion that the exclusive venue provision for delictual actions for injury or damages was intended only to address those delictual actions concerning conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by governmental officials on the lives of inmates. Thus, an ordinary malpractice action fell outside the scope of the exclusive venue provision. Neither the hospital nor the doctor were governmental officials whose actions affected the lives of inmate's, and a malpractice action for treatment received at the hospital was not an action with respect to the conditions of confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Alexandria Civil Service Commission appealed a judgment of the Ninth Judicial District Court, Parish of Rapides (Louisiana) that was entered in favor of appellees, Mayor and City of Alexandria, which found 2001 La. Acts No. 390 (Act 390) and Alexandria, La., City Ordinance No. 247-2003 (Ordinance) to be constitutional. The Commission argued that the provisions violated La. Const. art.

The Commission objected to the Ordinance and issued an order directing the Mayor to present his proposed plan to amend the Charter to the majority of the electors. The Mayor filed suit and obtained a restraining order against the Commission. The Commission filed suit against the Mayor, claiming that Act 390 and the Ordinance were unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment for the Mayor. The Commission appealed. The court affirmed the trial court judgment, holding that the Commission failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that Act 390 and the Ordinance were unconstitutional. The court found that Act 390 and the Ordinance were not in violation of La. Const. art. VI nor were they contrary to the Charter. The court found that under the Ordinance, the Division of Personnel and Civil Service was still headed by a Director of Personnel as required the Charter and that it was within the Mayor's authority to create departments within the divisions of his administration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was adjudicated delinquent as a result of having committed the crime of purse snatching. On appeal, the court found that the record did not support the juvenile's contention that the adjudication hearing was not completed. However, the court found that the trial court erred in denying the juvenile's motion to suppress identification evidence because it was unconstitutionally seized. La. Child. Code Ann. art. 818B could not constitutionally be applied to allow the juvenile to be picked up and taken to be photographed and fingerprinted. At best, it could be said that a detective had a suspicion that the juvenile had committed the crime of purse snatching. Yet, the juvenile, who was not in custody and who merely was suspected to have committed a crime, was taken from his home, fingerprinted, and photographed. Clearly, the juvenile was entitled to at least as much protection as an adult. The procedure followed in obtaining the juvenile's photograph and fingerprints could not pass constitutional muster. Accordingly, the identification evidence should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">From his life sentence for his armed robbery and aggravated rape convictions, defendant filed a number of writ applications. His motions for postconviction relief and reconsideration were denied. A federal district court dismissed his application for writ of habeas corpus as being time barred. Defendant filed another application for postconviction relief, which the Criminal District Court of Orleans Parish (Louisiana) denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant raised eight claims challenging the denial of his motion for postconviction relief, including: challenges to the indictment because of the exclusion of African-Americans on the grand jury; ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to file a motion to quash the indictment; and the use of an erroneous reasonable doubt jury instruction. The appellate court held that defendant's failure to file a motion to quash due to the alleged discriminatory selection of the grand jury barred relief. Further, defendant failed to present any evidence showing that he would not have been indicted by a properly-constituted grand jury. If counsel had filed the pretrial motion to quash, the indictment would have been quashed, but defendant would have been reindicted and convicted at trial. Thus, defendant failed to show prejudice, and his ineffective assistance of counsel claim had no merit. Finally, the appellate court reaffirmed that a so-called Cage instruction did not require reversal of defendant's conviction on grounds that it diluted the State's burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in violation of due process guarantees.</SPAN></P>

After the leases were terminated, the property owners learned that their property was contaminated with radium. The property owners filed an action seeking damages. A judgment was entered in favor of the property owners, awarding compensatory damages and one billion dollars in punitive damages. All parties appealed, and the court amended the judgment to reduce the punitive damage award to twice the general damage amount in order to comply with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed, including the denial of the oil company's exception of prescription. The trial court was not clearly wrong in determining that the property owner acted reasonably in relying on assurances that the property did not contain unacceptable levels of radioactive waste. The trial court did not err in correcting the record pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2132. The court found that for purposes of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.3, the cause of action accrued when the pipe company ceased cleaning pipes on the property owners' land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment by reducing the amount of punitive damages awarded to the property owners and affirmed the judgment as amended.</SPAN></P>

The 19th Judicial District Court, In and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, entered summary judgment for the instructor. The parties cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instructor was placed on administrative leave without pay pending investigation of allegations of sexual harassment. A removal hearing was scheduled, but it was delayed. The appellate court noted that the trial court erred in concluding that the removal policy section was the one under which the Board acted. On that basis alone, the trial court's ruling that the &quot;without pay&quot; provision of the removal policy section was unconstitutional had to be reversed. Nevertheless, the appellate court's de novo review of the record supported the factual finding of the trial court that the leave policy section of the general personnel policy was improperly applied to the instructor. The instructor's suspension violated the safeguards of due process. In his sole assignment of error, the instructor challenged the trial court's ruling that he was not entitled to conduct pre-removal discovery under the provisions of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure. Nevertheless, the appellate court did not read the language at issue in the Board's policy as incorporating by reference the discovery devices and procedures of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of attempted molestation of a juvenile by influence of control or supervision and attempted obstruction of justice. The Twenty-Second Judicial District Court In and For the Parish of St. Tammany, Louisiana, adjudged defendant a fourth felony habitual offender and sentenced him to 20 years at hard labor to be served without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the habitual offender bill of information, the State alleged that on November 12, 1999, defendant pled guilty to two counts of simple escape and two counts of issuing worthless checks. Defendant argued the November 1999 predicate offenses could not be used to adjudicate him a fourth felony offender as they were entered on the same date. The appellate court disagreed and affirmed defendant's status as a fourth felony offender because under the habitual offender statute, multiple convictions obtained on the same date based on unrelated conduct could be counted separately for sentence enhancement. As the convictions occurred on different dates and were not based on related conduct, defendant's status as a fourth felony offender was affirmed. The appellate court affirmed the sentence imposed as the statutory minimum sentence for the molestation of a juvenile was no less than 20 years. As defendant had not specified any unusual circumstances indicating that he was a victim of the legislature's failure to assign sentences that were meaningfully tailored to the culpability of the offender, the gravity of the offense, and the circumstances of the case, the 20-year sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to simple rape and simple kidnapping. Several years later, he filed a motion for a valid sentence. The trial court interpreted the motion as an application for postconviction relief. The trial court granted defendant's application. On appeal, the court explained that the State's remedy was to file a writ of review invoking the court's supervisory jurisdiction. Therefore, under the court's supervisory jurisdiction, it converted the appeal to a writ application. The court further found that because evidence existed that might have shown that defendant was not the perpetrator of the crimes, his claim that his Alford plea was not intelligently entered had merit. The State withheld evidence that defendant was entitled to have. Experts would have been required at trial to explain to the jury whether defendant's classification as a Group &quot;O&quot; secretor would have included or excluded him as a possible suspect in the crimes. The jury would have been given the opportunity to weigh the evidence along with other evidence that the State may have produced to determine defendant's culpability. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of, inter alia, possession with the intent to distribute heroin in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966A, and possession with the intent to distribute cocaine in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967A. Pursuant to a motion to reconsider sentence, the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section &quot;D&quot; (Louisiana) vacated the 25 year sentence and imposed a 13 year sentence. The State and defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence and that the drugs he abandoned as a result of the stop had to be suppressed because the officers had no reasonable suspicion to stop him. He argued that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion to stop him as a confidential informant's tip was neither detailed nor predictive and the officers did not corroborate the tip. The appellate court held that the officers' actions did not constitute either an actual or an imminent actual stop, and so defendant abandoned the bag prior to any unlawful intrusion into his right to be free from governmental interference. The officers lawfully seized the bag containing the drugs and, once the drugs were found, the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant, and incident to arrest, they could lawfully search him and seize the money from his pocket. Because there was no actual or imminent actual stop, it was immaterial whether the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant, but, even if their action constituted an imminent actual stop, the informant's tip, corroborated by police surveillance, was sufficient to support an investigatory stop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions, his sentences on his cocaine and marijuana convictions, and his adjudication as a second offender as to the heroin count were affirmed. Because the appellate court could not determine whether the trial court erred by imposing a sentence below the mandatory minimum on defendant's heroin conviction, the matter was remanded to the trial court for a determination on that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of possession of cocaine in excess of 400 grams, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F)(1)(c). Defendant made oral motions for a post-verdict judgment of acquittal and for a new trial, which the 16th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Martin (Louisiana) denied. On appeal, the conviction was overturned. The Louisiana Supreme Court reinstated the conviction and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and three passengers were stopped by a state trooper for a traffic violation. Defendant consented to a search which uncovered more than a pound of cocaine under the dashboard. The appellate court held that the trial court had not imposed a fine although one was mandated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F)(1)(c). Therefore, the sentence appeared to have been illegally lenient. The trial court, even in light of its determination that defendant was indigent, should have imposed the mandatory fine but without imposing default time under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 884. Defendant's 40-year sentence was not excessive because the sentence imposed fell in the lower-middle range of possible sentences. Applying the Barker analysis, the appellate court held that defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated because even though the delay until trial was slightly more than two and one-half years, the delay could not be entirely attributed to the State; at least some of the delay was attributable to defendant. Also, defendant had not asserted his constitutional right to a speedy trial while before the trial court or clearly alleged any prejudice to his case due to the delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed. However, the sentence was vacated for failure to impose the mandatory fine. The case was remanded for resentencing. The trial court was instructed that, if it found defendant was indigent, it was to impose the mandatory fine without default time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant beat a victim with a crowbar, causing serious head injuries. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of aggravated battery. He appealed after a life sentence was imposed due to the fact that he was a third felony habitual offender. In affirming, the court determined that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34. Self-defense was not a viable claim because defendant armed himself during a verbal exchange, followed the victim as he tried to leave the residence, and hit the victim from behind. The court did not have the authority to re-weigh the credibility of the witnesses. Moreover, the record showed that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 780. The trial court advised defendant about his right to a jury trial under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 (1974), defendant entered a waived by an oral statement in open court, and defendant was represented by counsel at all times. Next, the State proved all elements of the habitual offender bill under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15:529.1, and Apprendi did not apply to prior convictions. Finally, the sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tax debtor sought review of a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which rendered judgment in favor of defendants, a buyer and a city tax collector. The debtor had filed an action to annul the tax sale of his property, which had been conducted pursuant to the orders of the tax collector and had resulted in the property being purchased by the buyer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor's property was sold by the tax collector because of unpaid city and parish taxes in June 1995. The buyer purchased the property and a conditional tax deed was recorded. The debtor filed an action to annul the tax proceeding alleging, in part, that he did not receive post-sale notice as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2180A(1)(b), which was not enacted until after the sale had occurred, but did go into effect before the expiration of the three-year redemption period on the property. The trial court rejected the debtor's assertion that the notice was required to be given to the debtor, and entered judgment in favor of defendants. Reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court held that the notice provision of &sect; 47:2180A(1)(b), which went into effect on August 15, 1997, required the tax collector to give the debtor notice of his post-sale rights while the three-year redemption period was still in effect, even though the provision did not go into effect until after the sale. Providing the notice did not impact concerns about inappropriate retrospective application of the provision. Because the required notice was not given, the tax sale needed to be annulled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court and rendered judgment in favor of the tax debtor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowner filed a petition for declaratory judgment when defendant city tax assessor denied the homeowner's application for a homestead exemption, maintaining that he was the sole occupant of the purchased dwelling and that the dwelling was his residence. The Civil District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, agreed with the homeowner and granted his motion for summary judgment. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the city contended that La. Civ. Code Ann. art 477(B) did not constitutionally allow bond-for-deed purchasers to be eligible for a homestead exemption. The appellate court found that the property in question was owned and occupied in accordance with La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 20(A)(1); thus, the homeowner was exempt from taxes. Further, in accordance with La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 477, the homeowner was considered the &quot;owner&quot; of the subject property via a bond-for-deed contract for the purpose of obtaining a homestead exemption. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the city's argument that art. 477 was unconstitutional was without merit. Neither the record, nor the briefs, indicated that the homeowner and the previous owner both sought to benefit from the homestead exemption status. If anything, the laws were extended to protect the tax assessor from instances whereby people sought to &quot;double dip&quot; in their homestead exemption. The homeowner sought what was rightfully owed to him as a property owner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Ouachita, State of Louisiana revoked appellant inmate's pauper status for having three qualifying strikes under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1187. The inmate requested a writ application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court concluded that the inmate's underlying causes of action clearly fell within the definitional confines of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1181(2) et seq.; therefore, the causes of action were subject to the sanctions found in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1187. The inmate claimed that he was entitled to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 5181(B). After embarking on a close examination of the inmate's claims, the appellate court concluded that the trial court was correct in its ruling that the inmate's action was related to the conditions of his confinement, or the effects of actions by government officials on his life as a person confined in prison. Turning next to the question of whether the inmate's rights were infringed by the three qualifying strikes rule under &sect; 15:1187, the appellate court noted that the rule did not prohibit the inmate from pursuing his lawsuit, but merely required him to pay full filing fees. The inmate's right to sue for civil damages was not based on a fundamental right to file a civil suit cost-free. There was a rational basis for restricting the inmate's access to courts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the mother contended the trial court erred: in concluding that the child had no theory of recovery against her mother for her negligently inflicted prenatal injuries; and in finding that the employer was not vicariously liable for the negligent acts of the mother that caused damage to her unborn child. The appellate court found that it was possible that when the child became of age or was emancipated, she could bring a claim against her mother, and whether the child could at some point in her life sue her mother for negligently injuring her before birth was not before the trial court in the employer's motion for summary judgment; thus, dismissal of the child's claim against her mother was error. However, the employer had no choice but to keep the mother working while she was pregnant under The Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000e(k): the mother did not request light duty or ask to be moved to another assignment, and there was no evidence of prior negligence acts on the mother's part. Thus, the employer could not be held vicariously liable for the child's injuries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of attempted forcible rape, sexual battery, and simple kidnapping, violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:27, 14:42.1, 14:43.1, and 14:45. His motion for a new trial was denied. The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;A&quot; (Louisiana) sentenced defendant to serve, inter alia, 15 years imprisonment at hard labor for the attempted forcible rape and 4 years for simple kidnapping. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was also sentenced to seven years for sexual battery, with the sentences to run concurrently. Defendant contended that his 15 year sentence was excessive because he was only 19 years old at the time of the offense and because he was a first offender. Defendant did not file or make a motion to reconsider sentence that alleged any particular grounds. He objected to the sentence as excessive after it was imposed. Thus, defendant was limited to a review for constitutional excessiveness. The appellate court held that in the instant case, nothing in the record reflected that the trial judge abused her broad discretion when imposing the 15 year sentence for attempted forcible rape. Defendant grabbed the victim by her hair and neck and dragged her to a canal bank. After forcing her into the backseat of his car that he had previously parked there, he repeatedly struck the victim while attempting to have sexual intercourse with her. It was only the victim's evasive maneuvers that prevented defendant from completing the act of rape. Further, the Louisiana Supreme Court held that a sentence of 17 1/2 years at hard labor was not excessive for an 18 year-old with no prior convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and sentences were affirmed. The case was remanded with an order to the trial judge to advise defendant of the two year prescriptive period for filing post-conviction relief and its time of commencement. In addition, the trial judge was ordered to advise defendant of the registration requirements within 10 days after rendition of the appellate opinion and to file written proof in the record that defendant received such notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother of the child, not born of a marriage to the father, appealed a judgment ordering that the surname of the minor child be changed to that of the natural father. The court affirmed, however, stating that, according to the general prevailing meaning of the terms used and considering that the documents in question expressly outlined the construction to be given the father's signature thereon, the court could not say that the trial court clearly erred in finding that he did not intend to consent to the child's surname being the mother's when he signed the affidavit of paternity and the certificate of live birth. The parol evidence introduced at trial further supported that finding by the trial court. Also, former La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:34(B)(1)(a)(iv) substantially furthered an important governmental interest. Due to the large number of children born outside of marriage in Louisiana and the cost incurred by the State in establishing paternity and collecting child support, the State had an important interest in increasing the number of fathers who acknowledged and supported their children, thus reducing the costs borne by the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a writ application contending that the Thirty-Sixth Judicial District, Parish of Beauregard (Louisiana), erred in prohibiting introduction of evidence regarding a prior sexual assault against the victim, a minor child. The State filed a writ application contending that the trial court erred in ruling that evidence about a prior sexual assault would be admissible and that it waived the right to object to such evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of raping the victim. The evidence showed that the victim had previously been sexually abused by her grandfather. The appellate court found that the introduction of testimony concerning the causes of any alleged pre-existing conditions of the victim would be irrelevant; unnecessary to establish the facts sought by the defense; and unfairly prejudicial, confusing, and misleading. Also, evidence of prior incidents of sexual assault against the victim was prohibited by Louisiana's rape shield law. Thus, the trial court properly permitted general testimony regarding the potentially pre-existing physical condition of the victim, while excluding irrelevant and prohibited evidence concerning the alleged prior sexual abuse. However, the appellate court found that the trial court erred in ruling that the waiver by the State of its right to assert the rape shield statute could not be withdrawn prior to trial where the State apparently acquiesced to an erroneous ruling by the trial court and where the State had not even seen the documents from the Beaumont hospital. Thus, the State was not estopped from raising its objection based on the rape shield law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court denied defendant's writ. The appellate court granted in part the State's writ, permitting it to re-urge its objection to the Beaumont hospital records based on the rape shield law. The appellate court denied the remainder of the State's writ.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed and alleged his sentence was unconstitutionally excessive, and not particularized to him, and that the trial court erred in refusing his request for post-conviction bail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police went to defendant's house to arrest the individual who was living with him for a probation violation. While there, the police saw five marijuana plants growing in plain view behind the house; defendant admitted they were his. Defendant pled guilty to attempted cultivation of marijuana for the dismissal of the possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia charges. After the sentence was imposed, defendant filed a motion to reconsider his sentence, which was denied. The appellate court affirmed defendant's sentence and held that the sentence imposed was not unconstitutionally excessive, as the sentencing range for attempted cultivation of marijuana was five to thirty years and could not exceed one-half of the longest term of imprisonment prescribed for the offense attempted. Thus, defendant's four year sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive. Further, as the court considered defendant's personal history including his age, family ties, marital status, health, employment record, prior criminal record, and the likelihood of recidivism or rehabilitation, the sentence was particularized to him as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxing district filed a motion for judgment in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana. Following a hearing, a judgment was rendered as prayed for, and appellant taxpayers appealed. Subsequently, the matter was remanded for a full new trial on the merits. Following the new trial, the district court rendered judgment for the taxing district. Intervenor hotel association and intervenor individual appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxing district urged that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9038.21 operated as a suspension of law pursuant to La. Const. art. III, &sect; 20. The appellate court disagreed. The appellate court found the law to be a special law, but found no reasonable basis for the distinction. The statute violated La. Const. art. III, &sect; 12(A)(7) because the law exempted a facility to be operated as a hotel from paying already existing sales taxes imposed by statutes and ordinances, and it granted a private entity (the developer) a special privilege to use taxes imposed by the statute for private purposes. The appellate court noted that a classification of certain parties would not render a law special if it was based on a substantial difference between the class created and the subjects excluded, and there existed a reasonable basis for the distinction. Section 33:9038.21 was a special law, but the appellate court found no reasonable basis for the distinction it created. Section 33:9038.21 created an open-ended exemption from the present hotel occupancy taxes, and it was not uniform; it further violated La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29(D) by creating a special taxing district and political subdivision.</SPAN></P>

Appellant employer paid benefits but stopped paying them after the employee took regular retirement. The employer's motion under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1310.8 to modify the prior judgment was denied but the Office of Workers' Compensation, District 1W, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana). The employer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties agreed that the claimant had been receiving supplemental earnings benefits (SEB) and that the applicable statute regarding his entitlement to those benefits was La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1221(3). With the employer seeking to terminate a prior award of SEB, the issue was whether the workers' compensation judge (WCJ) erred in finding that the employer had failed to prove the availability of a job that satisfied the criteria set forth in &sect; 23:1221(3)(c)(i). The claimant admitted that he had not looked for employment since retiring but stated that he intended to continue working in some capacity when his hands/medical condition allowed him to do so. The evidence showed he had not sought treatment for his carpal tunnel condition for some time and that he had likely reached maximum medical improvement regarding that condition. The WCJ had the opportunity to observe the claimant testify and found him to be a credible witness. The WCJ carried over that observation to its reading of the claimant's deposition testimony on the issue of his intent to retire/continue to work. The court was unable to say that the WCJ's choice between the alternative conclusions was clearly wrong.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the WCJ was affirmed. Costs were assessed to the employer.</SPAN></P>

The Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, Louisiana, entered judgment for defendants, and the citizens appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature authorized the local governing authorities, where riverboats were berthed to levy an admission fee of up to $ 2.50 for each boarder.  In 1993, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:552 (now La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27:93) was amended to specifically direct how the proceeds collected would be distributed.  The parties designated to receive the funds from the two river boat companies in this action were: 80 percent to the City; 15 percent to the parish school board, and 5 percent to a youth shelter. 1995, the legislation was again amended to add another $ .50 to the boarding fee, with this additional amount to go to the police jury for widening a road and thereafter to be placed in its road fund. Defendants entered into contracts with the river boat companies that placed limits on the amounts all parties were to receive, except for the City. The appellate court reversed the judgment entered in favor of defendants and held that the legislature specifically delineated its intent as to how collected casino revenues were to be distributed. The subsequent amendment did not give defendants the authority to deviate from that method of distribution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to reconsider after the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), imposed a 35-year enhanced sentence on his conviction for illegal possession of stolen things valued at over $ 500, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:69. The court had previously vacated defendant's sentence and had remanded for resentencing in defendant's first appeal, and the state supreme court denied writs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his enhanced sentence was unconstitutional because he was entitled to a jury trial of the facts found by the trial court in his habitual offender proceeding. Defendant was found to be a fourth felony offender with predicate convictions of simple robbery, possession of PCP, and possession of cocaine. The court noted that defendant had demonstrated himself to be a career criminal. His prior arrests comprised numerous felony and misdemeanor offenses. Thus, the record supported the sentence imposed. In addition, longer sentences had been held to be constitutional for similarly situated offenders. Defendant's sentence was only 15 years above the minimum 20-year sentence. The court failed to find that defendant's assignment challenging his habitual offender finding should be considered because it was challenged for the first time on appeal. In any event, his argument had no merit. Defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the three years and three month delay between his conviction and sentence. As a fourth felony offender, the sentencing range he faced was 20 years to life. Thus, he could not reasonably have expected any sentence less than 20 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sentence, but remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to correct the habitual offender commitment for accuracy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Fourth Judicial District Court of Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, convicted defendant of second-degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment without benefits. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the State failed to meet its burden of proving his identity, the trial court erred in failing to admonish the jury following prejudicial statements, and his sentence was excessive. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the jury heard codefendant's testimony and chose to convict defendant mostly on the sole evidence of codefendant's testimony, which was well within the province of the trier of fact. While the prosecutor walked a fine line when he referred to defendant's failure to &quot;come forward,&quot; the appellate court found that the statement followed his reference to defendant's own action of coming forward to police during the crime's investigation years later. The prosecutor was contrasting the pretrial actions of the two accomplices and their behavior, not defendant's failure to testify. Thus, denial of defendant's motion for mistrial was not an abuse of discretion. Considering that defendant committed the planned robbery of the victim, choked and brutally beat him to death with a tire iron, and then left his body to decompose in a cotton field, the imposed sentence was neither grossly disproportionate nor shocking to the sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant indicated he understood his rights and wanted to waive the jury trial. The trial court also indicated that this was not an issue that the court would go back and forth on, and defendant reaffirmed his desire to waive his right to a jury. On appeal, defendant claimed that the record showed he was having second thoughts about the waiver and the trial court should have allowed him to withdraw. The appellate court rejected defendant's claim because there was no evidence he had second thoughts about the waiver. Also, defendant made no objection before or during the bench trial that he wanted a jury. Finally, defendant was properly sentenced as a habitual offender, as defendant had a prior controlled substance conviction and defendant did not preserve a challenge to the constitutionality of La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sexually abused a minor child. As a result, defendant was convicted of attempted sexual battery and received nine months in jail and probation. Defendant appealed, and the conviction was affirmed but the sentence was remanded for reconsideration. The trial court imposed a new sentence of three years at hard labor. Defendant challenged the conviction contending that the resentence was excessive, was contrary to sentencing guidelines, and that his counsel was ineffective. The court noted that La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 expressly prohibited excessive sentence. The court concluded that defendant's sentence was not excessive, even though it imposed a longer term, because it contributed to acceptable goals of punishment, was not imposed to inflict pain and suffering, and was not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime. Furthermore, defendant failed to satisfy the two-prong test to show ineffectiveness of counsel. Defendant failed to show that counsel's performance was defective, and that he was prejudiced. Finally, the court held that the sentence imposed was fully within the sentencing range for attempted sexual battery. Therefore, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Iberia (Louisiana), convicted defendant of two counts of armed robbery as well as attempted armed robbery and theft in excess of $ 500. He was sentenced to serve 20 years for each of his convictions for armed robbery, 15 years for his attempted armed robbery conviction, and five years for his conviction for theft. All of the sentences were ordered to be served concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence contained in the record demonstrated that defendant intended to plead guilty to count two, alleging a second count of armed robbery, even if not captured by the transcript because (1) the minute entry for his guilty plea hearing stated that he was pleading guilty to two counts of armed robbery; (2) he was clearly made aware of the nature of the charges and the number of counts against him several times during his guilty plea hearing; and (3) he signed a certificate outlining the plea agreement, which stated that he agreed to plead guilty to two counts of armed robbery. Additionally, the appellate court found that defendant's sentences were not excessive because (1) there was no indication that the sentences imposed were a purposeless imposition of pain and suffering or that they were grossly disproportionate to the crimes; and (2) defendant substantially benefitted through the plea agreement as his sentencing exposure was reduced significantly. Finally, the record did not support a finding that there was an agreement between defendant and the State or the trial judge which would set defendant's sentence at one-half the length of his co-defendants' sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences for the two counts of armed robbery, attempted armed robbery, and theft in excess of $ 500. However, the appellate court remanded the case to the trial court with an order to amend the minutes of sentencing to reflect that the sentences for the two counts of armed robbery were to be served concurrently with each other and to the other two sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an assessor for a municipal district, filed a petition for review of a decision of the Louisiana Tax Commission that reduced the valuation of a riverboat gambling casino vessel that was owned and operated by defendant taxpayer. The assessor appealed from a judgment of the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana) granting the taxpayer's peremptory exception of no right of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the assessor valued the casino vessel for ad valorem tax purposes, the assessor's valuation was affirmed by the local board of assessors. On the appeal that the taxpayer took to the Tax Commission, the Tax Commission reduced the valuation. In the action that the assessor brought for judicial review of the Tax Commission's decision, the trial court determined that the assessor had no right of action either in his official capacity or in his capacity as the bona fide representative of an affected tax-recipient body. On appeal, the court ruled that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:1989 and 47:1998(C), the assessor, in his official capacity, had the right to bring suit on behalf of the state to protect the state's interest in ad valorem taxes. The assessor also had the right under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1998(A)(1)(a) to institute suit as the bona fide representative of the board of assessors, the affected tax-recipient body. The court concluded that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1998, which provided for judicial review of Tax Commission decisions, did not violate the due process rights that were guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the part of the judgment granting the taxpayer's peremptory exception of no right of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, found defendant to be a third felony offender and sentenced him to life in prison without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The trial court later denied defendant's motion to reconsider sentence. Defendant appealed, asserting that the mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment was constitutionally excessive based on the facts of his case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 was unconstitutional, as the trial judge utilized facts not found by the jury at his underlying trial to enhance his sentence to life imprisonment in violation of Apprendi v. New Jersey. However, habitual offender proceedings did not charge a separate crime, but merely constituted ancillary sentencing proceedings such that the punishment for a new conviction was enhanced. As defendant's sentence was enhanced based on prior convictions, wherein he obtained procedural due process protections, and not any other fact, he was not entitled to a jury trial under Apprendi. However, defendant's case had been remanded from an earlier appeal. In reviewing the record, the appellate court found the trial court imposed a life imprisonment sentence under the mistaken impression that the appellate court instructed it to do so. Defendant was in fact &quot;subject&quot; to a life sentence as a third felony offender. But, because of the trial court's erroneous belief, and because the trial court failed to consider whether a life sentence in light of defendant's unusual circumstances was constitutionally excessive, remand was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence as a third felony offender was set aside, and the case was remanded to the trial court for a hearing and resentencing in accordance with law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Ouachita, Louisiana, which convicted him of two counts of second-degree murder and sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences. Defendant's first-degree murder conviction was reversed due to the trial court's failure to excuse jurors for cause, and, on remand, his motion to quash the indictment was granted based on systemic discrimination in grand juror selection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction, raising numerous points of error, including the restrictions on his right to cross-examine a cell mate and his accomplice and the admission of his plea discussions. The evidence showed that defendant and his accomplice murdered two victims after tying them up, taking them to a lake, and shooting them in the head. Defendant's tennis shoes matched impressions recovered at the crime scene, his fingerprints were found in one of the victim's homes, and the victim's car, watch, and jacket were found at defendant's apartment. The court rejected defendant's claim that the trial court violated his right to confrontation by refusing to allow him to cross-examine his cell mate or the accomplice, as defendant sought to question them on collateral matters and their testimony did not exculpate defendant or contradict their prior statements. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce evidence regarding his plea discussions, because it was used to corroborate the cell mate's testimony about little known facts that could only have been revealed in a private conversation with defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment that convicted defendant of second-degree murder and sentenced him to two life sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee of the title company used a hand-held scanner inside the clerk's office to copy a map and other public documents while conducting a title search. The title company filed an action against the clerk when he objected to such use. The trial court determined that the scanners were not permitted, and the title company sought review. In reversing, the court determined that there was a constitutional right to the free access of records under La. Const. art. 12, &sect; 3. This was codified in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:31. However, there were two exceptions for clerk's offices under La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44:32(C)(1)(c) and La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 251A. The court analyzed the plain language of the latter statutes to determine if the use of a hand-held scanner constituted the &quot;placement&quot; or &quot;installation&quot; of prohibited equipment within the office of the clerk. The court noted that both terms meant assigning or locating in a particular spot. A hand-held scanner did not fit within this definition. The court noted that the legislative history also supported this interpretation. Finally, the title company was awarded costs and fees under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:35(D).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed. The clerk was ordered to permit the use of the hand-held scanners. The court awarded reasonable costs and attorney fees to the title company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff children filed suit seeking damages related to their father's death while he was in the custody of defendant sheriff. The 33rd Judicial District Court, Parish of Allen (Louisiana), granted the motion to strike filed by defendants, the sheriff, the sheriff's department, and several deputies, because a jury trial was unavailable pursuant to the Louisiana Governmental Claims Act. The children filed an application for supervisory writs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children alleged that their father was denied medical assistance while confined in the parish jail and that the denial of treatment led to his death while in the sheriff's custody. In their application for a supervisory writ, the children contended that, even to the extent that the Act might operate to preclude a jury trial against the sheriff and the department, the Act could not be viewed as prohibiting a jury trial against the deputies. However, reading La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:5101(B) and 5102(B) within the context of the Act, use of &quot;political subdivision&quot; in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105 included officers or employees of that political subdivision, which included the deputies. Also, the children were not entitled to a jury trial in their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action, as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105 expressly indicated that they did not have that right, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 did not provide an independent basis on which a right to jury trial was conferred, and the Seventh Amendment's guarantee to a jury trial was not made applicable to the states. Thus, the children were not entitled to a jury trial on any of their claims against the sheriff, the department, or the deputies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court denied the children's writ application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant approached defendant about purchasing some drugs. Later, defendant convicted of one count of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. After sentencing on the drug charge, defendant was found guilty under a habitual offender bill. He was then sentenced to life in prison under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. Thereafter, defendant sought review. In affirming, the court determined that a statement made by one of the undercover agents was admissible under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 801(D)(4), even though the agent did not hear the conversation between the informant and defendant. In addition, defendant failed to object to the same testimony when offered by the informant. The officer's recitation of an accomplice's statement was admissible under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 801(D)(3)(b) because the course of events, coupled with the statements made by the accomplice, were sufficient to establish a prima facie showing of conspiracy. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim was meritless because the failure to object to two statements did not most likely result in the conviction. Finally, the life sentence imposed was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury for the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;G&quot; (Louisiana), found defendant guilty of two counts of distribution of marijuana. The trial court sentenced defendant to imprisonment at hard labor for 15 years on each count to run concurrently, with the first five years of the sentences to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold an informant one-half pound of marijuana on one occasion and two pounds of marijuana on another occasion. Defendant argued that his 15-year sentences were excessive for a 26-year-old convicted of non-violent offenses. The appellate court found that defendant distributed a large amount of marijuana on two occasions. Additionally, the appellate court found that had the trial court given defendant the maximum sentence on each count and ordered them to run consecutively, he would be serving a 60-year sentence; thus, defendant received a benefit from the concurrent 15-year sentences imposed. Also, sentences in prior cases supported defendant's sentences. Thus, the sentences imposed by the trial court were not constitutionally excessive. However, because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(B)(3) did not require that the first five years of defendant's sentence be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, that portion of the sentence was illegally excessive. Finally, defense counsel's affirmative response to a question by the trial judge as to whether defendant was ready for sentencing constituted a waiver of the required 24-hour delay in sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court amended defendant's sentence to delete that portion requiring that the first five years of his sentence be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. As amended, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;N&quot; (Louisiana) granted the motion for summary judgment as to the husband because he had received notice but denied the motion as to the wife because she had not received the required notices of the delinquent taxes or the tax sale. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife argued that notice had to be sent to each record owner of the property and due process required that she receive notice of the tax sale, as a record owner. The company argued that either spouse was a proper party to receive notice of a tax sale of community property, so notice to either spouse was sufficient. The company contended it sent notice to the husband, so notice to the community was perfected. The appellate court noted that no statute clearly stated whether or not both spouses in a community had to receive notice on delinquent taxes due on community property. The wife was not listed in the caption of the act of sale; however, she did sign the act of sale as an owner. Further, the property was community property, so the couple each owned an undivided one half interest. Accordingly, the wife had an interest in the property and had to receive notice of the delinquent taxes due and notice of the tax sale. The wife had not received that required notice, and thus, the trial court correctly denied the company's petition to confirm the tax title. The failure to provide notice of the tax sale to the wife was a violation of her due process rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court denying the company's petition for confirmation of tax title in favor of the wife was affirmed. Costs of the appeal were assessed to the company.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a previously convicted felon, became involved in a dispute between his mother and three of her tenants concerning return of a rental deposit. Defendant allegedly threatened the tenants with a pistol, and he fired one or two shots into the air, or in the general direction of the tenants. On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in imposing an unconstitutionally excessive sentence. Trial counsel did not file a motion to reconsider the sentence as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.art. 881.1. Counsel did, however, make an oral statement. This statement, as well as other statements made by the trial court at the sentencing hearing, revealed that the trial court, while aware of mitigating factors which would tend to favor a lighter sentence, was under the mistaken impression its sentencing discretion was quite limited and that the minimum sentence defendant could receive was five years. Because he was convicted of attempted possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, there was no minimum sentence. Had the trial court realized that no minimum sentence applied, the trial court might have chosen to impose a shorter sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;AFFIRMED IN PART, AMENDED IN PART, AND REMANDED.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to charges of obstruction of justice, aggravated burglary and theft in excess of $500, and two charges of attempted first degree murder. The Thirty-Fifth Judicial District Court, Parish of Grant, Louisiana, sentenced him to consecutive 32 years for each of the attempted first degree murder charges. He was also sentenced to five years for obstruction of justice and 15 years for aggravated burglary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers stopped the truck defendant was driving after receiving a complaint that it was suspicious. During the course of the stop, defendant began shooting at the officers; both officers were shot. Defendant later broke into a home where he was found by the police. Defendant's sole basis of appeal was that the sentences imposed were excessive. Before addressing the excessiveness claim, the appellate court reviewed the record for errors patent and remanded the matter for sentencing to be imposed on the theft charge, and amended the sentences for aggravated battery and obstruction of justice to be served at hard labor. With regard to the excessiveness claim, defendant did not raise any specific grounds; thus, under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1(E), the only issue was whether it was unconstitutionally excessive. Given that defendant shot two police, and the sentencing range for attempted first-degree murder was 20 to 50 years, the sentences of 32 years were not excessive. The court also held that consecutive sentences were not improper, as the judge stated the reason for the consecutive sentences was that defendant came very close to murdering two police officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentences for attempted first degree murder were affirmed, but were remanded to reflect that they were imposed without the benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence and without good time eligibility. The conviction of defendant on the theft charge was remanded for sentencing. Finally, the sentences for obstruction of justice and aggravated battery were affirmed, but were amended to reflect that they be served at hard labor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court originally reversed petitioner inmate's manslaughter convictions; however, on remand, the appellate court affirmed his convictions. Subsequently, the inmate filed an application for post-conviction relief. At the hearing on the merits, the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section &quot;A&quot; (Louisiana), denied the inmate's application. The inmate appealed the trial courts denial of his application for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that trial counsel manifested his apparent lack of knowledge of criminal law and procedure, rules of evidence, and trial techniques. He listed 22 examples of trial counsel's ineffectiveness. However, the appellate court found that the inmate was either unable to show that counsel erred or that he was prejudiced by counsel's errors. Thus, the inmate's ineffective assistance of counsel claims failed. Additionally, the appellate court found that the inmate did not carry his burden of proof under Brady and its progeny since he did not show that exculpatory evidence material to his guilt was withheld, and that the suppression of the evidence undermined confidence in the outcome of the trial. Also, the inmate's argument that the felony-murder doctrine did not apply was essentially an insufficiency of the evidence claim, which had already been raised on appeal. Thus, the trial court did not err in not considering that argument. In addition, the appellate court found that sentencing claims were not cognizable in post-conviction proceedings; thus, the trial court did not err in not considering the inmate's claims that his sentence was excessive, and cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court granted the inmate's writ, but denied his petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff senator alleged that the agreements donating property to the state were unconstitutional. The Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) granted the exceptions of no right of action filed by defendants, the governor, a state official, a company, and a non-profit corporation, and dismissed the senator's and intervenor wildlife organization's claims for declaratory judgment. They appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The senator alleged that to the extent the documents at issue could be interpreted as granting the company the mineral rights on state-owned land and water bottoms, the effect of the agreements would be an unconstitutional donation of public property. Moreover, the senator alleged that to the extent the agreements diverted to the company state income in the form of royalties on state-owned land, such diversion constituted an unconstitutional expenditure of state funds without an appropriation. Those allegations, if proven, would clearly have a detrimental effect upon the public fisc. Additionally, the senator also established his standing to bring the declaratory judgment action as a legislator because he averred that, through the execution of the agreements, executive branch officials had usurped the legislative duty of appropriating and budgeting the expenditures of the state. Accordingly, the senator's right to bring an action challenging the validity of those agreements was firmly established in the jurisprudence, and the trial court erred in denying him that right. However, the individuals members of the wildlife organization did not have standing to bring an action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction filed in the appellate court was denied. Trial court's judgment maintaining defendants' exceptions of no right of action as to the senator's petitions and dismissing his demands with prejudice was reversed. Defendants' exceptions of no right of action as to the wildlife organization's petition of intervention was affirmed, but the dismissal of its petition with prejudice was reversed.</SPAN></P>

Upon his admission, defendant's parole officer placed him under arrest for having contact with the inmate, a violation of his parole. The appellate court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions to suppress evidence because (1) there was probable cause to arrest defendant, and (2) no evidence was obtained as a result of his arrest. Also, the appellate court found that the trial court properly denied his motion to quash because the bill of information clearly charged a valid offense. Further, defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated. In addition, defendant was not entitled to a motion for change of venue as he failed to establish any reason why a fair and impartial trial could not be obtained in the parish where the prosecution was pending. Finally, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to recuse the trial judge since he failed to show or even allege any acts of bias or prejudice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was larger and stronger than the victim, he picked her up out of bed, carried her to his bedroom, despite her verbal protests, and pinned both of her hands behind her back.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two game clubs, sought a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction against defendants, a parish and the parish sheriff's office, after being informed that an existing parish ordinance against cockfighting would be enforced. The First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo, Louisiana, granted a preliminary injunction but deferred a decision on declaratory relief and a permanent injunction. The parish appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:102.1 was the state statute prohibiting cruelty to animals and it explicitly stated that fowl were not defined as animals. However, the parish ordinance prohibiting cruelty to animals included fowl, and therefore, allowing cockfighting was punishable as a misdemeanor under said ordinance. The appellate court noted that since the parish had adopted a home rule charter, it was therefore governed by La. Const. Art. VI, &sect; 5(E), and it could pass ordinances consistent with the 1974 Louisiana constitution unless denied by general law. Further, La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9 recognized the state's vital interest to define and provide for the punishment of felonies but failed to make such a provision concerning misdemeanors. However, the appellate court noted that implicitly, state law misdemeanors could be duplicated by local governments, but a local government ordinance could not contravene a state statute. The appellate court held the trial court correctly found that the parish ordinance abridged the police power of the state because the threatened prosecution under an unconstitutional ordinance presumed irreparable injury and impaired an existing property right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended his guilty plea was null and void, because he pleaded to an offense that was nonexistent at the time of the commission of the offense. The charging instrument alleged that the aggravated robbery occurred October 1, 2000; however, the crime of aggravated robbery was enacted and became effective almost one year after the commission of the offense. The State asserted on appeal that defendant and his attorney requested that he be allowed to plead guilty to aggravated robbery because it was not defined as a crime of violence. According to the State's brief, defense counsel assured them that he would not raise the issue on appeal and would raise only an excessive sentence issue. The State contended it proceeded with the plea agreement based upon this reassurance. The appellate court determined, however, that jurisdictional defects were always reviewable, and these defects were non-waivable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, three brothers, appealed from a judgment of the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana), which convicted them of second-degree murder after granting the State's motion to rescind the plea agreements on the ground that they did not testify truthfully at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were originally charged with second-degree murder, but pled guilty pursuant to plea agreements to the reduced charge of second-degree battery. The trial court granted the State's motion to rescind the plea agreements on the ground that defendants did not testify truthfully at trial. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court decision as to two defendants. The court held that the transcript of the plea hearing established that the factual basis was an integral part of the plea agreements and that defendants acknowledged that they understood their plea agreements were based on truthful cooperation and testimony. The court found that defendants failed to meet their burden to establish that they complied with the plea agreements, and the record showed they were evasive and untruthful. The court reversed the trial court rescission of one defendant's plea agreement, as his responses to the prosecutor's questions showed that the other defendant held and swung the knife and was the only one stabbing the victim. The court rejected one defendant's other claims of excessive punishment, ineffective assistance of counsel, double jeopardy, defective indictments, and misjoinder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed two defendants' murder convictions and sentences. The court reversed the trial court's rescission of the third defendant's guilty plea, vacated his conviction and sentence for murder, and ordered that his guilty plea and sentence for second-degree battery be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with three counts of battery upon three different correctional facility employees while detained in jail, violations of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34.5, and was found guilty. Defendant was sentenced, but after a multiple offender hearing was found to be a second felony offender, and the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division &quot;E&quot; (Louisiana), sentenced defendant to six years. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The multiple offender bill alleged defendant was a fourth offender. However, he was sentenced as a second felony offender, as the court thought that a sentence as a fourth felony offender might have been unconstitutionally excessive. As a second felony offender, defendant faced a sentencing range of two and one-half to 10 years of imprisonment. Defendant argued that the trial judge had no basis for imposing the sentence. The pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) classified defendant as a third offender. At the time of the commission of the underlying offense, he was 51 years old. Prior to that time, he had been arrested for several felonies, in particular, attempted murder and attempted armed robbery in 1969. However, the PSI indicated the district attorney's office was not able to associate the 1969 charges with the arrest, and defendant pled guilty to a lesser charge and was given six months in parish prison. The trial judge imposed a mid-range sentence of six years. Under all of the circumstances, in particular, defendant's past criminal history, the appellate court found no abuse of the trial judge's sentencing discretion in imposing the enhanced six-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The matter was remanded to the trial court for the limited purpose of informing the defendant of the time period for seeking post-conviction relief and correcting the commitment to conform with the transcript.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with theft of goods valued between $ 100 and $ 500 and pled not guilty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed in a store placing watches into a metal pot that she was holding. Defendant passed the cash registers to get to the entrance door, but she did not try to pay for the items. Defendant was originally sentenced to two years at hard labor with credit for time served, La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:67.10(B)(2), and the trial court stated that it was imposing the maximum sentence. After a hearing on the multiple offender bill, the trial court vacated its original sentence and resentenced the defendant. Defendant's only argument on appeal was that her two-year sentence was excessive, and defendant did not challenge the validity of her conviction. The two year sentence was vacated by the trial court after defendant was found to be a multiple offender, and therefore, defendant's sole assignment of error was moot. Any claims involving defendant's habitual offender sentencing must be addressed in a separate appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beneficiary filed a petition for possession in an intestate succession. The detailed descriptive list did not include an annuity. He later filed a rule to determine if there was any inheritance tax due on the annuity. After the district court determined that the annuity was taxable under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 47:2401, 2404, the beneficiary sought review. In affirming, the court determined that an annuity contract under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:647(B)(2) was not entitled to the same legal status as an insurance contract. Life insurance proceeds were excluded from taxation under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2404(C). The annuity in question did not fall under the exclusion in &sect; 47:2404(C) because it was not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. The fact that an exemption for creditors for both annuities and life insurance existed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:647 did not mean that the two types of contracts enjoyed the same legal status for all purposes. Further, the Department did not act as a creditor in the context of imposing an inheritance tax on an estate. Finally, the court declined to address the beneficiary's argument concerning constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Municipal Officers' Supplemental Pay Board of Review (board) and members, sought review of the decision of the Nineteenth District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which found in favor of plaintiffs', employees, and reversed the denial of the employees' applications for supplemental pay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were full-time radio dispatchers, and the board denied their requests for supplemental pay on the basis that they were not Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) certified. The trial court reversed the denial of the employees' applications, and the court affirmed. The issue on appeal was whether the board erred in its interpretation and application of the eligibility requirements of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2218.2(A)(1). The court affirmed, concluding that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2405(C) clearly had no application to the stipulated factual situation herein. Rather, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2218.2(A)(l) was the applicable statute, and its application clearly provided that the employees were entitled to state supplemental pay. Because the employees were employed as police officers prior to March 31, 1986, they were not required to obtain POST certification as a requisite for state supplemental pay eligibility. Accordingly, the court found no error in the judgment of the district court, which reversed the board's denial of the employee's applications for state supplemental pay on the basis that the employees were not POST certified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor hotel association appealed a judgment of the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish, Division &quot;M-7&quot; (Louisiana) denying in part its motions for new trial. The trial court allowed the association to address, in brief only, the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9038.21, and refused to hear any new evidence, but allowed the association to proffer evidence pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1636. The association appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association argued that the trial court violated its due process rights in granting a new trial without allowing the introduction of any additional evidence or the cross-examination of prior testimony. Specifically, the association argued that because it did not receive actual notice of the hearing, it was entitled to a full and complete new trial. The appellate court agreed that the trial court clearly recognized that a substantial injustice would result if a new trial had not been allowed. The only possible basis for the trial court's decision was that it believed the association had not received adequate notice of the hearing. Despite that conclusion and the trial court's statement that it desired &quot;to place all parties on equal footing,&quot; it had refused to give the association a full new trial. Rather, it limited the new trial to argument (in brief form) on constitutional challenges only. That ruling was an abuse of the trial court's discretion, particularly in light of the statement in the trial court's corrected reasons for judgment that it found that the association had failed to clearly and convincingly show that &sect; 33:9038.21 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court abused its discretion in granting only a limited new trial, and the matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Secretary of State (secretary), sought review of the decision of the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which found in favor of plaintiffs, committee and electors, and granted a writ of permanent injunction enjoining him from placing Act 926 on the September 18, 2004 election ballot. Plaintiff's further filed a motion to transfer the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The secretary appealed a judgment granting a writ of permanent injunction enjoining him from placing on the September 18, 2004 election ballot a proposed constitutional amendment, Act 926. Act 926 involved the proposal to the constitution that defined marriage as a union of one man and one woman. The court stated that the trial court erred as a matter of law in addressing the issue of whether the proposed new article confined itself to a single object. In light of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1405(C), the merits of the issue could only be attacked when and if the electors adopted the proposed amendment. Further, the legislature, by adopting Act 926, did not violate either the laws or the constitution of Louisiana when it set the election for the proposed amendment on September 18, 2004. Thus, the trial court erred in granting the injunction on that ground. Because the proposed constitutional amendment had no force of law, La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 3601, the record failed to disclose grounds for issuance of an injunction. There was also no evidence in the record of the legislature exceeding its authority in amending the joint resolution as originally filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied plaintiffs' motion to transfer the case and affirmed the overruling of the secretary's peremptory exceptions of no right and no cause of action.

The court of appeal disagreed. A witness testified that both she and defendant needed money. They discussed robbing the victim. She drove defendant to the victim's trailer and under the pretext of using the telephone. She witnessed defendant stabbing the victim. Although the witness gave five different accounts to the police of the events of the crime, in each of her accounts she implicated defendant as the actual murderer. Her false statements mainly centered around her involvement in the crime. Defendant's cousin testified that defendant came to her home on the night of the homicide to request her brother's assistance in changing a flat tire. Defendant offered her $ 20 to call her brother. The brother testified that defendant was in the possession of &quot;a lot of money&quot; when he came to her home. Blood found on the inside of the passenger's door of the car belonged to the victim, and defendant's DNA was recovered from the console of the car, the T-shirt, and the currency used to purchase money orders. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81.2 and two counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences, but the court affirmed, stating that the evidence sufficiently supported all convictions. Defendant engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with his seven-year-old daughter and the evidence was clear that the child was visiting with defendant and that he exercised control and supervision. Thus, molestation conviction was appropriate. Further, the indecent behavior convictions were proper because he permitted his daughter to view sexually explicit movies coupled with inappropriate touching and nudity. Defendant's behavior showed a pattern of exposing children, including his son, to erotic or semi-pornographic movies as a conduit for more specific sexual contact. A jury could reasonably have found under those circumstances that this wanton conduct was lewd and lascivious. His sentence was not excessive and the evidence of other crimes involving defendant's stepdaughter and her friend, who were six or seven years old, established identity, proved intent, guilty knowledge, motive, system, scheme, opportunity, and/or acts tending to show his &quot;lustful disposition&quot; in accordance with La.

The victim identified defendant in a photographic lineup and in open court. Although defendant argued that the victim was not occupying the car when it was taken, the court held that the victim's presence in the vicinity of the car was sufficient to establish that the car was in his immediate control; hence, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of armed robbery under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64, rather than carjacking under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64.2. The identification was not overly suggestive, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it chose to believe the victim's identification testimony over that of defendant's alibi witnesses. Defendant's sentence of 30 years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive, given that defendant was a second felony offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners sought rezoning of land on the edge of a heavy industry district for the purpose of residential and commercial development. Businesses operating in the surrounding heavy industrial districts opposed rezoning on the ground that residential and commercial development would not be compatible with the existing heavy industry. Following the denial of rezoning, the owners sought review, arguing that the police jury lacked authority to regulate zoning of the land. The court found no merit in that claim, concluding that Bossier Parish, La., Ord. 783 was not inconsistent with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:106.1 and that an amendment to &sect; 33:106.1 allowed the parish police jury to regulate all land within five miles of city limits pursuant to the ordinance. Moreover, the owner did not show that the actions of the police jury in denying his request for rezoning were arbitrary and capricious. The record established that the decision to deny the request for rezoning was debatable and that considerations of public health, safety, and general welfare could have, and did, justify the denial. The zoning decision appeared to have been based on appropriate and well-founded concerns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because the State did not prove the requisite intent. The court of appeal disagreed. There were a number of circumstances from which a rational trier of fact could have concluded that defendant had the specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm upon the victim. First, there was evidence that defendant shot one victim in the head at very close range and that the same gun that was used to shoot that victim was used to shoot the other victim numerous times. The victim was shot with that gun in the torso, both from the front and the back, in the head, and in other areas of his body. Clearly, shooting the victim in the torso and in the head evidenced a specific intent on the part of defendant at least to commit great bodily harm. Further, defendant did not deny that he was participating in a drug transaction when the victim was shot. Therefore, even if the fatal wound were inflicted by someone other than defendant, defendant was a principal to the crime.</SPAN></P>

Defendant dropped something to the ground &quot;very discreetly.&quot; A police officer walked over and retrieved the object. Once police officers determined that the substance tested positive for cocaine, the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant. Defendant was not entitled to suppress the cocaine. The record reflected that defendant was not actually stopped until after he abandoned the cocaine. Since defendant discarded the cocaine prior to any unlawful intrusion by the police, the cocaine was lawfully seized. Upon his plea to possession of cocaine, the trial court sentenced him to imprisonment at hard labor for five years to run concurrent with his parole violation. However, the trial judge failed to state that this sentence was to be served without benefits of probation or suspension of sentence. This error patent did not require any action by the appellate court, because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:301.1(C) imposed these restrictions by operation of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed a judgment of the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), dismissing his petition for writ of habeas corpus on the basis of his failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The inmate alleged the unconstitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.5, contending its application by appellee department of public safety resulted in a deprivation of his constitutional rights. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed, inter alia, that his claim was a habeas corpus application challenging the department of public safety's legal authority to place him on supervised release and to revoke his release, a claim not subject to administrative remedies. The appellate court agreed with the inmate that his claim was not governed by the Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure (CARP), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1171 et seq. The appellate court concluded that, while not a claim governed by CARP, the inmate's claim was also not one that could have been raised through post-conviction habeas corpus under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 362(2), in that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.5 had been upheld on numerous occasions and, thus, there was no application of a statute declared unconstitutional to trigger a true habeas corpus claim. Rather, such a claim involving a liberty interest or asserting deprivation of a constitutionally protected right was a civil matter over which the trial court retained original jurisdiction. However, even accepting the allegations of the pleadings as true, the inmate failed to state a cause of action, in that he was not legally entitled to the relief sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was amended to reflect that the inmate's claims were dismissed with prejudice on the basis that he failed to state a cause of action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a rehearing to review its previous ruling relating to a tort action. Ruling that a decedent's children were parties needed, the court remanded to the18th Judicial District Court, Parish of Iberville (Louisiana). On remand, the trial court overruled appellant corporation's peremptory exception raising the objection that appellee testamentary executor had no right of action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent brought a tort action against the corporation. The trial court had rendered judgment in favor of the decedent. An appeal was taken before the decedent died. The executor was substituted as a party. On original hearing, the court ruled that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the corporation's motion to amend its answer to assert the statutory employer affirmative defense. During the oral argument on rehearing, the court noted that it was arguable that the decedent's surviving children, and not the executor, were the proper parties. The court remanded to the trial court, which overruled the corporation's peremptory exception raising the objection of no right of action. The court reversed the trial court's ruling. The court stated that the legal effect of construing La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.1, La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 801, and La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1519 together was that the decedent's death caused her legacy of the tort cause and right of action to lapse pursuant to the provisions of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1589(2). When the decedent died during the pendency of the case, the executor lost his legal capacity to receive the legacy.</SPAN></P>

The court reinstated its judgment on original hearing and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The trial court was instructed to cause the substitution of the deceased's children as parties in the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Morehouse, Louisiana, which convicted him of second-degree murder and which sentenced him to life imprisonment without parole. The charge against defendant arose from a liquor store robbery in which the store owner was killed. A co-offender agreed to testify against defendant in exchange for being allowed to plead guilty to the reduced charge of armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the jury adversely considered his decision not to testify when it requested copies of any statements by him and the co-offender. In affirming, the court held that there was no rational basis by which to conclude that the innocuous jury request indicated an improper consideration of defendant's right to remain silent. Furthermore, the jury instructions as to second-degree murder and manslaughter were not so incomplete as to preclude the jury's ability to properly consider manslaughter as a responsive verdict. The judge and attorneys had merely simplified the charge for the jury, to aid them in reaching a just verdict. Defendant failed to show that his trial counsel erred in approving the instructions or that the jury reached an unreliable verdict. Defendant made no showing that the State committed any constitutional error by obtaining a search warrant for a DNA sample without a hearing, nor by harvesting defendant's DNA at a time when his counsel was not present. Finally, the court found meritless defendant's claim that the State had asked leading questions to his co-offender, which prevented him from receiving a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff parish police jury challenged a decision from the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Morehouse (Louisiana), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, several owners and two tax officials, in a dispute involving the tax exempt status of land designated as a wildlife management area (WMA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the owners entered into a lease agreement with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (DWF). The property was used for a WMA, which allowed for a tax exemption under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:24. A resident filed a declaratory action challenging the classification of the property. Later, the parish joined the action. After a motion for summary judgment was granted, the parish sought review. On appeal, the court determined that &sect; 56:24 was not unconstitutional.&nbsp;La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 21 stated that public lands were exempt from taxation. The court determined that the lease agreement demonstrated that the land was used by the DWF for a public purpose, which was the establishment of a WMA. As such, the property fell with in the public land exemption in &sect; 21. However, it was unclear if the lease met the 25-year requirement of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:24. The agreement provided for a 25-year term, but it allowed a termination in 30 days by either party. The court found that this created an ambiguity as to the intent of the parties.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 21st Judicial District Court, Parish of Livingston, Division &quot;C&quot; (Louisiana), validated a bond issuance by appellee economic development district created pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9038.2 to fund an economic development project in the parish that would have facilitated the location of a retail outlet in the parish. Appellant opponent taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, the taxpayer argued that the application of the tax increment financing statute (TIF law), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:9038.1-9038.10, to the particular project under consideration violated certain constitutional and statutory provisions and that the alternative plan was not approved by all participating entities. The appellate court held that the fact that the project benefited private entities, either by disbursement of revenue bond funds to procure facilities for the use of private businesses or by the subsequent transfer of property so procured to a private entity for a nominal price upon retirement of the revenue bonds, did not render the project violative of La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14. Testimony at the hearing held in the instant case revealed the extent to which the project would economically benefit the parish. The district was comprised of undeveloped property that generated no sales tax revenue. Without the incentive plan offered by the state and local government entities to the shops to locate in the parish, the company might have decided against opening a retail center in the parish, and the district would have continued to have generated no sales tax revenue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. All costs of the appeal were assessed to the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee was injured while working for appellee city as a firefighter. He obtained workers' compensation benefits, but shortly after the accident, he obtained his retirement pension benefits. The city then terminated his workers' compensation benefits. Pursuant to the employee's disputed claim, the Louisiana Office of Workers' Compensation (OWC) approved the termination of his supplemental earnings benefits (SEB). The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, who had began his employment with the city in 1966, did not attempt to engage in any employment. The employee argued that the OWC judge erred in finding that he had retired from the work force and in denying him the maximum 520 weeks of supplemental earnings benefits (SEB) as allowed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1221(3)(d)(ii). The Louisiana Supreme Court had found the portion of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1221(3)(d)(iii) that terminated benefits upon a claimant's receipt of social security old age benefits unconstitutional. However, the supreme court had expressly declined to consider the constitutionality of that portion of the statute terminating benefits when a claimant retired. The appellate court noted that an employee who expressed his intention to both retire or stop working and not look for other employment, and who made no effort to find another job, retired within the meaning of &sect; 23:1221(3)(d)(iii). In such case, whether an employee &quot;retired&quot; was determined on a case by case basis. In reviewing the record, the appellate court concluded the employee did in fact retire. Thus, the OWC properly held the city was entitled to terminate SEB benefits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred by permitting the State to try the charges against him in connection with two separate criminal incidents in a single trial and the sentence he received was excessive. The appellate court found that the joined offenses were triable by the same mode of trial. Further, the Williams criteria were met, and defendant suffered no prejudice from having the charges against him joined at trial; the facts of each offense were simple and each of the criminal incidents was a completely separate event with its own set of witnesses such that the jury would not have been confused by the various counts and would have been able to segregate the charges and the evidence. Defendant's sentence of imprisonment at hard labor for 203 years without the possibility of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence was not excessive, considering the crimes he perpetrated were abhorrent, he was among the worst offenders for whom the maximum sentences were reserved, he showed no remorse for his crimes, and one of his victims was going to suffer from permanent physical problems as a result of his injuries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.30.1, following a jury trial. The 27th Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Landry (Louisiana), denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence of his shoes that he claimed were unconstitutionally seized without probable cause or reasonable suspicion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three detectives testified that defendant was cooperating with the investigation and that he consented to give up his shoes. The issue of consent turned on the credibility of those testifying and the weight of the evidence. The trial court had not abused its discretion in denying the motion to suppress. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in allowing expert witness testimony that reached conclusions that were solely within the province of the jury. The expert gave a summarizing opinion of the evidence before the jury and concluded that the State's theory of the case was the only reasonable explanation. Thus, the expert's opinion invaded the province of the jury and was in violation of La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 704. But, at trial, the physical evidence tying defendant to the crime scene was uncontroverted. Inter alia, his DNA was found in a blood smear on the panel of the door that was kicked in at the victim's house and his shoe contained a blood droplet with the victim's DNA and glass similar to the glass found in the broken window of the house. A reasonable jury could have concluded that defendant was at the crime scene. Thus, the expert's opinion was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, convicted defendant of one count of racketeering and two counts of possession with intent to distribute marijuana. On appeal, defendant's sentences were vacated and remanded for re-sentencing. On remand, defendant was re-sentenced to 30 years at hard labor on each conviction, to be served concurrently. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended his sentences were excessive and the trial court erred in denying his motion to reconsider sentence. The appellate court held that the fact that defendant's co-defendant received a more lenient sentence did not necessarily indicate that the penalty imposed on defendant was excessive. Further, the record established that defendant's involvement in the narcotics business was more substantial than his co-defendant's. Contrary to defendant's complaint, the appellate court did not find that the sentences imposed were vindictive; defendant neither alleged nor demonstrated that he was not free to accept any plea offers made by the State. Based on evidence showing that defendant ran a large-scale narcotics-distribution operation in which he moved significant quantities of marijuana on a regular basis, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing concurrent 30-year sentences or in denying defendant's motion to reconsider sentence. The trial court's advisal to defendant of the provisions of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 930.8 was incomplete.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed but remanded with instructions that the trial court inform defendant of the prescriptive period at the time of sentencing and to amend the commitment to reflect the trial transcript.</SPAN></P>

The client filed a malpractice action against the law firm on January 20, 2003. The appellate court affirmed the exception of peremption filed by the law firm and found the client's claims were perempted by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5605. As the complaint against the law firm alleged that the law firm's negligence was its failure to timely add the other parties to the law suit, the malpractice claim would have had to have been filed by September 19, 2000. The appellate court also held that as the client failed to prove how she was denied due process of law, the right of access to the courts, or the right to petition for a redress of grievances, her claim that &sect; 9:5605 was unconstitutional failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge denied the commission's petition for writ of mandamus, finding that the judges had sufficient interest to question the constitutionality of La.

The supreme court found that the case was not properly before it and transferred the case to the court of appeals. The appellate court determined that, although it had appellate jurisdiction, because the trial court judgment did not declare the statute unconstitutional, like the supreme court, it could not rule on whether the trial judge erred in finding the statute unconstitutional. The appellate court concluded that the claim was still pending and the procedurally correct resolution was to remand the case to the trial court for a determination of the unconstitutionality issue and to issue a modified judgment to include his decision into the judgment denying the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross-appeals were taken from a judgment of the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which, in a labor dispute, awarded plaintiff firefighters' union a sum of damages, annual leave days, legal interest, additional pension contributions, and an adjustment to base pay to include all longevity raises that defendant employer should have paid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer, a home rule city, argued that minimum wage statutes for firefighters violated La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33:1992(B), 33:1996 represented a valid exercise of the state's police power and were constitutional as applied pursuant to La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9(B). An amendment seeking longevity pay was prejudicial and did not relate back under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1153; hence, the three-year prescriptive period of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3494 ran from the filing of the amended petition. The trial court did not err in allowing a credit for periodic longevity raises. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1992(B) required longevity raises for 20 years of service after the initial three years. Supplemental pay was included in base pay for the computation of longevity raises. New Orleans, La., Civ. Serv. Comm. R. VIII, &sect; 1.2, which limited the period of time for earned vacation days to be used, did not violate La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1996. Injured firefighters who lost scheduled annual leave were entitled to compensation. Pursuant to La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14, as amended, vacation and sick leave benefits were included in the calculation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment with respect to the calculation of longevity pay. The court affirmed the determination of constitutionality, the credit for periodic longevity raises, and the validity of the vacation day limitation. The court reversed with respect to the calculation of vacation benefits forfeited by injured firefighters, and the court remanded for recalculation.</SPAN></P>

He later filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming that his attorney pressured him to make the plea. The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, denied his motion. The trial court also denied defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence and to dismiss the indictment underlying the conviction. Defendant filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the case at bar, the transcript from when the guilty pleas were entered indicated that defendant was represented by an attorney when he entered the pleas. The trial judge fully explained defendant's rights and questioned him as to whether the pleas were knowing and voluntary. The judge explained the maximum sentences that defendant could receive. Defendant said that he understood the rights and that he had no questions. Therefore, defendant's pleas were knowing and voluntary and the Boykin colloquy was adequate. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw the guilty plea. Although the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to quash his grand jury indictment, defendant's substantial rights were not affected because he was indicted by a grand jury selected according to local laws. The error did not require reversal of his indictment, convictions, and sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose on an application for writs directed to the Civil District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In compliance with statutory provisions, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5121, et seq., the taxing district filed a motion for judgment seeking validation of the contemplated agreements, contracts, and transactions. The intervenors filed motions to intervene as defendants, opposing the taxing district's request as unconstitutional, as, among other reasons, it diverted public funds to a private property developer. The taxing district argued the lower court's ruling was erroneous because it permitted intervention after a final judgment was rendered. Yet, given the expedited nature of the validation procedure, the legislatively expressed intent to provide an equitable process with regard for the public fisc and rights of interested parties, plus the procedural exclusivity language in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5122, it appeared that the Louisiana Legislature implemented La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5126 to vest the trial court with discretion as to intervention to safeguard the rights of interested parties. There was no time limitation as to intervention expressed in &sect; 13:5126. Also, there was no case law on point to confirm or negate the foregoing conclusion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's original conviction and sentence for second-degree murder was reversed and remanded for a new trial. Upon retrial, the Criminal District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, again found defendant guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defendant's motion for reconsideration of sentence was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict, the trial court erred by allowing the admission of hearsay evidence, and his sentence was excessive. The appellate court found that an eyewitness's testimony describing the getaway car and positive identification of defendant as the person who killed the victim, combined with the fact that defendant hid in the attic when the police came to the house to arrest him, was sufficient to support the verdict. Further, even if information regarding defendant's relationship to his wife and mother-in-law was inadmissible hearsay, the admission was harmless, as any reference to defendant's relationship to his wife and mother-in-law was not a factor in the jury's decision; the jury had ample evidence upon which to convict defendant based on the in-court eyewitness's identification of defendant. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in not ordering a pre-sentence investigation, as it was not requested and the trial judge was required to impose a mandatory sentence. As second-degree murder was one of the gravest offenses one could commit, a mandatory life sentence was warranted.</SPAN></P>

The claimant went to pick up his check the next day, and the employer told him that he could not have his check until he signed a statement saying he had quit. The employer deducted $ 134 from the claimant's check to pay for the tow truck. At trial, the employer denied that an accident had occurred, and that he never paid a tow truck fee. The employer also admitted to lying about whether it had workers' compensation insurance, and not calling the insurance carrier when the accident occurred. As a doctor testified the claimant was injured after the accident, and the appellate court deferred to the trial court for determinations of credibility, the judgment in favor of the claimant was affirmed. The penalties were also affirmed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1210F as the employer did not reasonably controvert the claimant's claim that the employer failed to provide benefits.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court set aside and annulled the convictions and sentences, stating that since the record established that the trial judge represented the defendant on a 1987 charge of attempted forcible rape which resulted in a conviction, and that the 1987 conviction was admitted as other crimes evidence, the trial judge should have been recused pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 671(A)(3). The failure to recuse was not harmless error inasmuch as the trial judge was required to rule on the admissibility of that 1987 conviction, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 921. The trial court erred when it refused to give the jury limiting instructions regarding the proper purpose and use of the other crimes evidence as requested by defendant. It could not be ruled out that the jury convicted the defendant of the present offense because he had been convicted of committing the same offense in the past.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a medical review panel issued an adverse decision, plaintiffs, a former patient and her spouse, filed an amended petition against defendants, a medical center, the state attorney general, and a blood center, alleging strict liability for the use of tainted blood on the patient. The Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, Louisiana, granted the center's exception of prescription. Plaintiffs petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ten years after receiving blood at the medical center, the patient was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. In a previous appeal, the court held that plaintiffs' strict liability claim was one of medical malpractice, making the three-year prescriptive period in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. ?? 9:5628 applicable. At issue in the instant appeal was plaintiffs' claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied. The court agreed. Under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. art. 1, ?? 2, plaintiffs had a vested property right to file a damage suit in tort. A doctor testified that a person contracting Hepatitis C would not experience any symptoms for a period of approximately 10 years from the date of receipt of the contaminated blood. Such was the case for the patient. The court held that to enforce the three-year prescriptive period on such facts would have resulted in a denial of due process rights. Therefore, the court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. ?? 9:5628 was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings. Costs were assessed to the medical center.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208 for performing an unnecessary surgery. The trial court granted the store's exception for lack of jurisdiction. The doctor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor treated the store's employee after the employee was injured on the job. The doctor performed a cervical diskectomy and three-level fusion at the C3-4, C4-5, and C5-6 levels despite the contrary opinions of three other specialists, who felt that the surgery was unnecessary. The store's employee sought workers' compensation benefits, and the WCJ found that the cervical diskectomy and three-level fusion performed by the doctor was medically unnecessary and unreasonable. The judgment stated that the doctor had violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208. The doctor filed his petition to have that portion of the workers' compensation judgment nullified. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's grant of the store's exception for lack of jurisdiction. The appellate court held that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1310.3(E), the Louisiana Office of Workers' Compensation Administration had exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising out of workers' compensation law. As the allegation that the doctor had violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1208 arose out of workers' compensation law, the court had no jurisdiction to hear the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), which imposed an additional three-year sentence, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:50.2, after she pled guilty to being a second offender. She had been convicted of purse snatching, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:65.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed, asserting as her sole assignment of error the trial court's imposition of an additional three year sentence pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:50.2, which provided for the discretionary imposition of an additional three year sentence when the victim of certain crimes of violence was 65 years old or older. Defendant had snatched the victim's purse. The court affirmed, however, stating that, given the procedural history of this case coupled with the fact the actual sentence imposed on defendant did not exceed the statutory maximum for purse snatching, the court found no due process violation occurred as a result of the trial court's expressly considering the victim's advanced age in setting the sentences. The court also noted two relevant factors. First, the State filed a pretrial motion to invoke the sentencing enhancement provision of &sect; 14:50.2. Second, defendant failed to object in the trial court to her 18-year sentence, in general, and the constitutionality of &sect; 14:50.2, in particular. The court thus found that defendant's argument that her sentence should be vacated unpersuasive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual battery and attempted indecent behavior with a juvenile. As a third felony offender, he was sentenced to 12 years on count one, with credit for time served, and, on count two, to a consecutive sentence of seven years, with credit for time served. The Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, resentenced him to three and one-half years on count two, with credit for time served. This appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and defendant's girlfriend agreed to go to a neighborhood bar. When the mother returned to the house, her daughters told her that defendant had touched them inappropriately while the mother was gone. He was arrested. At trial, the mother testified that defendant exposed himself to her children, raped one, and demanded oral sex from the other. Defendant was not entitled to present evidence of the rape victim's prior sexual contact, because he did not file a pretrial motion in compliance with La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 412. Defendant's sentences of 12 years of imprisonment as a third felony offender for committing sexual battery upon an 11-year-old female and three and one-half years for attempted indecent behavior with a four-year-old were not unreasonable punishment. The trial judge's failure to specify that defendant's sentences were subject to the restrictions listed in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:43.1(C) did not require remand for correction; defendant's sentences had to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>

Further, the evidence showed that an attempted robbery was consistent with the testimony of the accomplice and other witnesses. The court also noted that defendant gave an inculpatory statement regarding his role in the crime. The fact that the weapon was fired in close range of the victim's head was sufficient to show that defendant had the specific intent to commit the crime under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1(A). Finally, the court determined that the sentence imposed was not unconstitutionally excessive. The trial court was not required to give reasons for the sentence, and defendant did not show any facts that warranted a departure.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmate was convicted in a disciplinary board proceeding of being a threat to security and was sentenced to a transfer to maximum custody. He filed a petition for judicial review with respect to defendants, disciplinary board members, asserting their action was unlawful. He sought damages and an injunction. The 19th Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, dismissed the petition. The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the relief the inmate sought was not simply reversal of his disciplinary board conviction. Rather, he sought monetary damages for the rights violation he claimed occurred when he was wrongfully convicted. His petition for injunctive relief, filed after his petition for judicial review, arose from an entirely different set of facts. The inmate's action was in fact a delictual action, which did not fall under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1177, which governed suits for post-conviction relief or habeas corpus relief. The claims for which the inmate sought injunctive relief were subject to the administrative remedies procedure, and the inmate had to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit in district court. The inmate's action was governed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1186, regarding proceedings in forma pauperis. The appellate court held that, because the inmate's action was not a proceeding for post-conviction relief or habeas corpus challenging the fact or duration of confinement in prison, a stay of the proceedings was appropriate under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1186(2)(b), because the inmate had not paid required court costs and fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court remanded the proceedings to the trial court with instruction to order a stay of his action until all costs and fees owed the trial court by the inmate were paid. Costs of the appeal were assessed to the inmate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with aggravated battery, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34. Defendant pled not guilty. After a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of the responsive offense of second-degree battery, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34.1. The 22nd Judicial District Court, Parish of Washington (Louisiana), sentenced defendant to five years of imprisonment at hard labor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Inter alia, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of second-degree battery. The appellate court did not agree. To prove a second-degree battery, the State had to prove that defendant: (1) committed a battery upon his wife; (2) without her consent; and (3) intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury. It was undisputed that defendant intentionally committed a battery and his wife did not consent to the battery. Moreover, there was no evidence to suggest that his wife did anything to physically threaten defendant that would have justified him in striking her repeatedly with the handle of a pistol and with his fists and feet. The jurors were charged with the law regarding simple battery, which did not require serious bodily injury. They were advised that they could return that verdict if the evidence did not support conviction for a more serious grade of the offense. For the additional reason that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of the originally charged offense of aggravated battery, the jury's verdict of guilty of the responsive offense of second-degree battery did not entitle defendant to a reversal of his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed. The sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporation had filed an action against appellant parish for freight charges and lease payments. The parish now sought suspensive appeal of the judgment by the 25th JDC, Parish of Paquemines, Louisiana, that denied its motion for a new trial in favor of the corporation. The corporation cross-appealed the partial motion for summary judgment in favor of the parish that denied its claims for attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation sued the parish for the return of sales and use taxes paid under protest and claimed damages and attorney's fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and &sect; 1988 on the grounds that it was deprived of its federally protected property rights. The parish had presented the corporation with a tax assessment for delinquent sales/use taxes, penalties, and interest resulting from the freight charges and leasing of barges used in their deliveries. The corporation paid the tax under protest. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the corporation and ordered the parish to return all taxes, interest, and penalties paid under protest. The appellate court noted that Plaquemines, La., Parish Ordinance No. 98-117, &sect; 14-51 defined &quot;sales price&quot; in the same manner as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:301(13)(a). As &sect; 47:301 did not provide for the inclusion of transportation and freight charges as part of its taxable base, then neither could the ordinance include freight charges in the sales price for the purpose of calculating sales tax. The corporation was not entitled to its attorney's fees as it was allowed to pay its taxes under protest and receive a refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's denial of the parish's motion for new trial and its grant of its motion for partial summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 144. Plaintiff city had issued summonses to the owner for violating &sect; 144.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was issued two misdemeanor summonses for violations of Broussard, La., Mun. Code &sect; 144. The trial court upheld the decision of the magistrate court suspending the owner's occupational license for 15 days. On appeal, the court determined that the proceeding was civil rather than criminal. While the purpose of the ordinance was to promote the protection of the citizens and to maintain peace, which was both a civil and a criminal objective, violators suffered no loss of liberty, incarceration, or fine. The court further found that, under either La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:1896 or 33:4788, the owner was entitled to a trial de novo by the trial court. The owner, as a defendant in a civil proceeding, was entitled to a trial de novo. Finally, the court held that, in light of its decision that the case be remanded for a trial de novo, the owner's contention that the city did not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt was rendered moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the case for a trial de novo.</SPAN></P>

Defendants also appealed from a subsequent judgment taxing costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was rendered a quadriplegic after receiving medical treatment for injuries sustained in a traffic accident. The court found that the award of costs pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 970 was valid. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.42B(1) was clear that costs in amounts over the cap were permissible. The trial court erred, however, in taxing costs to the physician. While the limitation of liability for a qualified health care provider was $ 100,000 plus interest, liability of LPCF was limited to $ 500,000 plus interest and cost. Special interrogatories sent to the jury were proper, and the finding that the patient was in need of future medical care and related benefits pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.43 was noted correctly in the final judgment. The jury did not abuse its discretion in the award of special damages to the patient's mother for reimbursement of custodial care rendered to her daughter. It was harmless error for the trial court to keep from the jury the factual finding that there was insufficient evidence to meet the burden of proof for a finding of liability for the patient's damages against the driver in the accident or the hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment taxing costs to name only the LPCF. The court affirmed the judgments as amended.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court reversed the order and held that as the city was not a party to the action, and never served with the judgment, the judgment was null as to the city under La. Code Civ. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, son, moved to be appointed independent administrator of decedent's estate. Respondent, decedent's former wife, filed a petition to have the decedent's will probated and to be confirmed as the testamentary executrix. The Civil District Court, Orleans Parish, Division M, Louisiana, appointed an attorney not involved in the litigation as provisional administrator, and the parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son asserted that the decedent died intestate, and the wife asserted that the decedent died testate. The appellate court determined that the issue was whether La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1608(5) was applicable to a testament executed in 1990. The appellate court found that the application of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1608(5), which was part of the revision law of successions adopted by 1997 La. Acts 1421, effective July 1, 1999, to the decedent's testament would fly in the face of long-standing law and jurisprudence. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1608(5), concerning revocation of a legacy or other testamentary provision due to divorce, did not apply to the last will and testament of the decedent. The decedent's succession was not opened until after the effective date of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1611(B), and, at the time he executed his will, the legacy to the wife and the appointment of her as executrix was not prohibited under Louisiana law. The will specifically stated that the decedent desired to leave his entire estate to the wife, his then spouse, and that he desired the wife to serve as executrix. There was no evidence that the decedent wished to revoke the legacy and appointment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant filed a petition and set forth an action for nullity seeking to nullify two money judgments rendered in favor of appellee employer previously rendered in a prior proceeding appealed. The Office of Workers' Compensation (OWC), District 1E Parish of Ouachita, Louisiana, dismissed the claimant's petition. The claimant appealed, and the employer and cross-appellant insurer answered seeking damages for a frivolous appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant action asserted that the OWC lacked jurisdiction in the first action to award money damages to the employer for restitution. After a contradictory hearing, the worker's compensation judge found the OWC had jurisdiction as a matter of law and dismissed the nullity action. The claimant appealed. His former employer and its insurer answered, seeking damages for a frivolous appeal. The gist of the claimant's argument in this appeal was that the OWC had no jurisdiction to award money damages except in awarding compensation benefits. The appellate court generally held that: the claimant's challenge to the OWC's jurisdiction and to the constitutionality of the statutes enabling the OWC to enter the awards, including his action challenging the subsequent award for damages for investigation and litigation, was barred by operation of La. Code Civ. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured party challenged a decision from the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee company in a negligence and strict liability action. The injured party also challenged the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1671.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A piece of wood hit the injured party after it fell from a piece of scaffolding owned by the company. The injured party later filed an action against the company, which alleged negligence and strict liability. After its initial motion for summary judgment was denied, the company filed a motion for reconsideration based on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1671. The injured party's attorney prepared a memorandum in opposition to the motion, but did not appear in court. The document contained a statement that the application of &sect; 40:1671 was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection. After the motion was granted, the injured party sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the injured party had not preserved the issues regarding summary judgment for appellate review. The only issues before the court concerned the constitutionality of &sect; 40:1671 and the procedures for attacking the constitutionality of a statute. The court found that the injured party did not notify the attorney general at the trial court level. Further, the attack on &sect; 40:1671 was not contained in any pleadings. The memorandum did not constitute a pleading.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
