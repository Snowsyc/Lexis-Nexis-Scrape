</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant medical service provider sued appellee insurer in the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida), alleging that the insurer had regularly failed to pay interest on late-paid personal injury protection (PIP) benefits as required by Fla. Sta. ch. 627.736(4) (1995). The insurer moved for summary judgment. The trial court entered final summary judgment in the insurer's favor. The medical service provider appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The medical service provider accepted assignment of PIP insurance benefits from its patients. As the assignee of such benefits, the provider was entitled to receive PIP payments directly from the insurer. The provider claimed that the insurer regularly failed to pay interest on late-paid PIP benefits as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(4) (1995). The insurer moved for summary judgment, claiming that the forms executed by the provider's assignor did not constitute a valid assignment. The insurer also argued that its tender of payment extinguished the entire claim. The trial court found for the insurer, concluding that the action should have been dismissed following the insurer's tender of interest due on the late-paid benefits without provision for payment of the provider's attorney's fees, because the provider had inappropriately sought to litigate rather than arbitrate as mandated by Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(5) (1995), and the provider incurred no fees between the time arbitration was ordered and the time payment was tendered. On appeal, the court found that pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 627.428(1) (2002) the insurer's tender of payment entitled the provider to a fee award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon remand from the Florida Supreme Court, the intermediate appellate court considered defendant's appeal from his conviction of robbery, aggravated assault, and kidnapping, with a firearm; and from his sentence as a prison releasee reoffender after the dismissal of a juror, the denial of defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal, the denial of defendant's motion to interview the jury, and the granting of defendant's motion in limine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant opinion was substituted for the intermediate appellate court's previous opinion. Defendant argued that he was denied his right to be present when the sleeping juror was dismissed. The intermediate appellate court held that the argument was waived, as it was not presented to the trial court. Defendant was not prejudiced by the delay in ruling on his motion to disqualify the juror because the alternate was present for all the testimony. Defendant did not specify grounds for his motion for a new trial, or at least a juror interview, arising out of the jury's note expressing their fear of retribution. The police officer's testimony relating the store manager's description of his assailant was inadmissible hearsay, but the error was harmless. The State's repeated reference to defendant's race, while improper, did not make the trial unfair. Fla. Stat. ch. 943.325 (1999) did not apply to the taking of defendant's DNA because the samples were taken prior to his conviction. The trial court's refusal to exclude the DNA evidence was within its discretion, although the samples were submitted to the FBI. The prison releasee reoffender act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Duval County, Florida, convicted defendant of burglary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that his counsel was ineffective as he failed to argue the elements of burglary of a dwelling, and for failing to investigate a possible intoxication defense. The appellate court held that defendant stated a legally sufficient claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by alleging his lawyer failed to delineate the elements of burglary of a dwelling or pursue lesser offenses, including that of burglary of a structure. Moreover, defendant alleged prejudice in that burglary of a structure was a third-degree felony, whereas burglary of a dwelling was a second-degree felony, and the record showed that defendant burglarized a detached garage, and nothing in the attachments disclosed that it was enclosed by a fence. Pertinent case law established that burglary of a detached garage not enclosed together with the home by a fence did not constitute burglary of a dwelling. Defendant also set forth a facially sufficient claim by alleging that he was drinking alcohol and smoking crack cocaine before and while he was looking for work the day of the incident. Such allegations were sufficient to warrant further inquiry regarding counsel's strategy on the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That part of the trial court's judgment, which denied defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, was reversed, the remainder of the judgment was affirmed, and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fireworks company sought an injunction to prevent appellee city from &quot;interfering&quot; with its business by enforcing and seeking to enforce the city fire code. The fireworks company appealed the grant of summary judgment by the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) in favor of the city. The fireworks company asserted, inter alia, that the fire code was a land development regulation enacted without following the proper procedure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireworks company planned to open a retail store in a downtown shopping center to sell fireworks to consumers. The city approved the opening of the store provided certain conditions were met. The fireworks company did not seek administrative review of the decision, but brought litigation instead. The appellate court held the fireworks company failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. However, it reviewed the allegations that the city's fire code was void ab initio. The fire code, Orlando, Fla., Code &sect; 24.01(b) did not regulate what could be built on land, rather it mandated requirements for the structure of a building, if used for certain purposes, in order to safeguard the public from fire hazards. The purpose of the fire code was to prevent fire and explosion through the regulation of conditions which could cause fire or explosion. The code's effect on building structures was incidental. Further, the purpose of the code was not to regulate land use, but to insure public safety and welfare. Its adoption was not subject to review by a local planning agency and thus it was validly adopted by the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the County Court for Pinellas County (Florida) which certified a question from the county court as a matter of great public importance after a jury found defendant guilty of violating Fla. Stat. ch. 843.085 (2001), unlawful use of police badges or other indicia of authority. Defendant challenged the statute on the grounds of overbreadth, vagueness, and substantive due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a convenience store dressed in a black T-shirt on which was printed a large star and five-inch letters spelling &quot;Sheriff.&quot; The large star depicted a crest and read &quot;Pinellas County Sheriff's Office.&quot; The shirt was used in emergency response situations. Defendant was also wearing denim shorts and sandals. A police officer who happened to be present questioned defendant and discovered she was not an employee of the sheriff's office. She was subsequently charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 843.085(1). The appellate court held her conduct clearly fell within the prohibitions of Fla. Stat. ch. 843.085. The incidental effect the statute may have on First Amendment rights did not justify application of the strict scrutiny level of review, rather, the rational basis test was proper in a substantive due process analysis. Individuals wearing, without authorization, full law enforcement uniforms or displaying law enforcement badges were not entitled to First Amendment protection for their conduct. Fla. Stat. ch. 843.085 was not overbroad or vague and did not violate the right to substantive due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant struggled with a store clerk before grabbing an open cash drawer and running from the store. Defendant was convicted and sentenced in the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) for robbery, battery, and petit theft. Defendant argued that he should be re-sentenced on the robbery charge because the Florida habitual violent offender statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's sentence for robbery because the unconstitutionality of the habitual violent offender statute was cured retroactively. However, the court certified the question of whether the curative statute passed in 2002 should be applied retroactively to the offenses defendant committed in 2000. Further, the court found that double jeopardy barred dual convictions for both robbery and petit theft of the same property in the same incident from the same clerk, as there was no separation of anything: time, object, place, or circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The property appraiser put up a general denial with an affirmative defense asserting the constitutional invalidity of &sect; 192.042. The trial judge agreed with the property appraiser and held that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal the court affirmed, adopting the reasoning set out in another opinion on that issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandparents had custody of the child under a court-approved stipulation between the parents and the grandparents. The mother's previous motion for custody was denied. The appellate court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 61.13(7) had been ruled unconstitutional, and that the proper consideration in a custody determination between a parent and third parties was whether the mother was a fit parent, and whether a transfer of custody to the mother would be detrimental to the child. The grandparents' contention that the issue was whether there was a substantial change of circumstances and whether a change of custody would be in the best interest of the child was rejected. The grandparents' claim that their rights did not accrue from ch. 6.13(7), but from the trial court's order granting them custody, making them custodial parents, was also rejected. The evidence supported the trial court's finding that a transfer to the mother would not be detrimental to the child. Further, the trial court's order granting the grandparents visitation rights in the event that the father was unable to exercise his visitation rights was reversed as it violated the mother's constitutional right to privacy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the order granting visitation rights to the grandparents was reversed. The order was affirmed in other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the State sued certain parents for criminal neglect of their minor children, the newspaper sought access to investigative files maintained by state agency concerning the children. The agency moved to dismiss the action based on insufficient process, lack of jurisdiction, and improper venue. The appellate court held that the agency waived its challenge to the sufficiency of service by seeking a transfer of venue. Because the agency denied access to documents that were maintained in Palm Beach County, the act of denial occurred in Palm Beach County, not at the agency's home office. Therefore, the correct use of Fla. Stat. ch. 119.07(7) (2002) was that such an action could be brought where the records were being kept and where access was being denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) granted defendant's motion to correct an allegedly illegal sentence by eliminating his designation and consequent sentence as a habitual felony offender, finding that 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188, the Three-Strike Violent Felony Offender Act, was unconstitutional as violative of the single subject requirement of the Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court was bound by Taylor to rule as it did. The appellate court however, was not and it held that directly contrary to Taylor, 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 was not invalid. Because the Florida Supreme Court would have to resolve the conflict with Taylor, it was necessary only rather summarily to announce that the appellate court believed that each provision of the statute was sufficiently related to the others and to the general purpose of the Act as a whole, and that the constitution was therefore satisfied. Chapter 188, was designed to protect the public from repeat and serious violent felony offenders. The statute as a whole was quite plainly not a &quot;cloak&quot; for dissimilar legislation having no necessary or appropriate connection with the subject matter, and thus did not violate Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and the conflict was certified. On remand, the designation of defendant as a habitual felony offender was to be restored and his sentence adjusted accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) which denied his motion to correct an illegal sentence. Defendant alleged he was illegally sentenced as both a habitual felony offender (HFO) and a prison releasee reoffender (PRR) for one criminal episode. Defendant claimed his sentence or sentences were illegal since Fla. Stat. ch. 99-188 had been declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Neither defendant's motion nor the trial court's order told the appellate court anything regarding the offense or offenses for which defendant was sentenced. Because defendant did not allege that he received both PRR and HFO designations for a single offense, his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) claim was facially insufficient. The appellate court's affirmance on that issue was without prejudice to any right defendant might have had to present a facially sufficient claim that he was illegally sentenced as both a PRR and an HFO on the same offense. Defendant alleged that he was sentenced prior to the enactment of Fla. Stat. ch. 99-188. Thus, it was immaterial that it was later declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board held a hearing at which it found that the landowners were in violation of a building code. Several months later, a supervisor submitted an affidavit of non-compliance averring that the landowners had not complied and asking that the board impose a fine. A hearing was not held and there was no indication that the affidavit was served on the landowners. The board summarily approved the imposition of the fines and a lien based solely on the affidavit and without further discussion. The landowners were not given notice or an opportunity to be heard before the entry of the order. The landowners sought review and the circuit court affirmed. On the landowners' petition for writ of certiorari, the court granted the petition and quashed the circuit court's order, holding that the board denied the landowners procedural due process and the circuit court applied the incorrect law in determining otherwise. The court held that when the imposition of a lien required additional factual findings, due process in the context of Fla. Stat. ch. 162 required some pre-deprivation or post-deprivation process for the property owner to test the validity of those findings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the denial by the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) of his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion, after his sentence for violating Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(1)(a) (1999) by trafficking in cocaine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that because the law mandating a minimum sentence for his crime had been stricken, and because he committed the crime during the window period for challenges, he should be resentenced. The issue was whether the legislature, when reenacting the criminal punishments contained in a law after it was stricken on constitutional single subject grounds, could apply the reenacted punishments retroactively to the effective date of the earlier law. The appellate court held that 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 212 could not be applied retroactively under the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and the Florida Constitutions. The retroactivity portion of ch. 212 was retrospective and the act disadvantaged defendant. Chapter 212 was void ab initio. Martinez did not apply to criminal cases, and expressly did not decide whether a retroactive reenactment was constitutionally permissible. Chapter 212 was not an operative fact as contemplated in Dobbert. Defendant was sentenced before the effective date of ch. 212, and could not be sentenced under the 1999 statute. He also could not be sentenced under ch. 212, which could not be applied earlier than its effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed and the case was remanded with directions that defendant be resentenced. The conflict created by the decision was certified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County, Florida, dismissed appellant van converter's attempt to have the underlying matter determined a trial de novo, and enforced the prior arbitration decision. The van converter appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The van converter challenged the judgment entered in a Lemon Law case. The Lemon Law scheme granted a form of hybrid, more intensive, judicial review. Instead of deferring to the arbitrator's decision, the loser in Lemon Law arbitration was given the right de novo to convince a judge that the arbitration decision was wrong. It was for this reason that appellee buyer's argument in support of the motion to dismiss was not well taken. First, because the trial de novo was a form of review of the arbitration decision, the appeals court did not think that the failure of the party losing the arbitration necessarily should always bar that party from offering evidence showing that the Board's default decision, or the finding that the vehicle was defective within the meaning of the Lemon Law, was erroneous. To hold that the default barred the van converter from showing that the vehicle was not defective was to deny it the very review afforded by the statute. On remand, the van converter was to be given an opportunity to offer evidence purporting to show that the arbitration decision was erroneous, and the buyer of course was to be allowed to present any contrary evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his resentencing by the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) after his motion to correct illegal sentences was granted. His earlier sentences had been imposed pursuant to an open plea under incorrect sentencing guidelines. The trial court determined he was entitled to be resentenced under the rule announced in Heggs. On resentencing, the trial court imposed habitual offender sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant committed several armed robberies. The State filed a habitual offender notice. Facing the possibility of consecutive, habitual offender sentencing, defendant entered an open plea. At that sentencing hearing, a prior scoresheet was used. The trial court determined that defendant qualified for habitual offender sentencing but decided to impose multiple concurrent sentences under the guidelines. When defendant received relief under Heggs, his guidelines score sheet resulted in a significantly lower sentencing range. At the resentencing, the trial court decided that adequate sentences could not be structured under the lower guidelines range. Thus, it imposed concurrent 25-year habitual offender sentences for all of the armed robberies. The new sentences were roughly equivalent to the old sentences. The appellate court held the original sentence was illegal. A harsher sentence could be imposed on resentencing in such a context without violating double jeopardy. The mandate in Heggs required trial courts to resentence eligible defendants &quot;in accordance with the valid laws in effect&quot; on the date of offense and also authorized habitual offender sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal and petition for writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), appellant, the Florida Department of Agriculture, challenged the trial court's order declaring the 2002 Citrus Canker Law amendments unconstitutional, enjoining the Department from entering private property without individually issued search warrants, and denying an application for 69 search warrants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to fight citrus canker, Fla. Stat. ch. 581.184 (2002) was enacted. It permitted the destruction of citrus trees within a 1,900-foot radius of a diseased tree. Appellees, growers and others, challenged the law and the trial court granted relief, declaring the statute and Fla. Stat. ch. 933.07 (2002) unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held Fla. Stat. ch. 581.184 (2002) did not violate substantive due process because Florida could use its police power to protect the citrus industry where compensation was given for the destruction of trees. The statute did not violate procedural due process because the affected parties' rights were protected by the availability of inverse condemnation. Fla. Stat. ch. 933.07 (2002), which provided for area-wide warrants, was unconstitutional and the Department was required to obtain search warrants in conformance with the Fourth Amendment and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The trial court's restrictions, including single affidavits and search warrants for each individual property and the prohibition of the issuing judge's electronic signature, were neither statutorily nor constitutionally based.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Florida Sexual Predator Act was unconstitutional in that the automatic registration and notification requirements of the Act were violative of his protected right to procedural due process, guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Defendant claimed that the Act infringed on his liberty interest in reputation. He asserted, inter alia, that the lifelong registration requirements, employment prohibitions, and the inability to pursue tort remedies pursuant to the Act satisfied the plus requirements of the stigma-plus test. On appeal, the court found that the total failure of the Act to provide for a judicial hearing on the risk of defendant's committing future offenses made it violative of procedural due process, and therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) adjudicated two minor children dependent after finding that appellant father had physically abused one of the minor children on more than one occasion. The circuit court then awarded custody of the two minor children to their natural mother, a non-resident of Florida. The father and appellee state agency appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and the mother were divorced in Massachusetts. The father received custody of the two minor children and moved to Florida. The trial court took evidence as to the fitness of the non-custodial mother and retained jurisdiction while commenting about the custodial father's case plan and possible reunification. There was no evidence before the trial court or sought by the trial court that the mother was unfit. The trial court found that delays inherent in the Interstate Compact on Placement of Children (ICPC), codified at Fla. Stat. ch. 409.401, Fla. Stat. (2001), rendered it unconstitutional to the extent that it precluded or delayed placement of children in the custody of a nonoffending parent when no detriment to the children was shown. The appellate court noted that retention of jurisdiction placed the matter squarely within the requirements of the ICPC. Further, the trial court's placement of the children with their non-custodial, non-offending, out-of-state natural mother was also consistent with the ICPC and ICPC Reg. 3(6)(b). However, the trial court erred in finding the ICPC process unconstitutional in order to ignore the ICPC procedures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings with instructions that the court comply with the IPCP.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, appellant compensation claimants sought review of orders of the Judges of Compensation Claims (Florida), which held that because the claimants were injured and reached permanent total disability (PTD) prior to age 62, they were not entitled to supplemental benefits after age 65. The claimants challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(1)(e)1 (1991) and Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(1)(f)1 (1995).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants both suffered industrial accidents that rendered them permanently and totally disabled before the age of 62. Both collected disability payments and appellee insurance carriers terminated the payment of supplemental PTD benefits on the basis of Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(1)(e)1 (1991) and Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(1)(f)1 (1995). The claimants sought supplemental benefits for PTD after they reached 65 and the respective judges of compensation claims denied the claims. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the termination of the benefits under the statutes was not precluded by the Supremacy Clause because federal law, specifically 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 424a(d), did not preempt the statutes. The termination of benefits under the Florida statutes was not a reverse offset pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(10) and therefore was not in conflict with 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 424a, where the effect of both the state and federal statutes was to avoid duplication of benefits. Nor did the Florida statutes violate the guarantee of equal protection on the basis of age discrimination because the legislature's statutory objective of reducing premium costs satisfied the rational basis test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decisions of the respective judges of compensation claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant boxing promoters sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), which determined that Fla. Stat. ch. 548.06 (2000), which imposed a five percent tax on boxing promoters, did not violate the freedom of speech provisions of U.S. Const. amend. I. Appellant cable network additionally argued that the trial court erred in dismissing it as a party plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The promoters arranged live professional boxing events, many of which were made available to consumers on a pay-per-view basis through entities such as the network. Appellee Florida Boxing Commission sent demand letters to the promoters, seeking the five percent gross receipts tax due pursuant to ch. 548.06. The network claimed that it could have been considered a promoter and joined the suit seeking relief based on allegations that the statute imposing the tax was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The trial court dismissed the network and granted summary judgment against the promoters. On appeal, the court found no error. The court held that a boxing match did not constitute either pure or symbolic speech and declined to extend First Amendment protection to the promoters of a boxing match. The court therefore upheld the facial validity of ch. 548.06. Boxing conveyed no message or idea and thus had no content that was protected by the First Amendment. The court further determined that ch. 548.06 on its face did not apply to the distributors of boxing matches to cable networks; thus, the trial court did not err in dismissing the network's facial challenge to the statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted and sentenced under the 1995 guidelines and then resentenced under the 1994 guidelines. The trial court denied defendant's claim that he should have been sentenced under the most lenient guidelines in effect during the time frame alleged in the information and, instead, applied the guidelines in effect on the end date alleged in the information. On defendant's appeal, the court reversed and remanded for resentencing. The court held that defendant was entitled to be sentenced under the most lenient of the three sentencing guidelines that were in effect during the relevant time frame. The court specifically held that Fla. Stat. ch. 921.001(4)(b)(3) was to be applied only in cases where the charged felony was a true continuing offense and was not to be applied in cases where the information charged an offense that occurred at some unidentified point in time during a specified time frame.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions by the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida) for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, carrying a concealed weapon, and possession of cocaine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon observing the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger make an illegal turn, an officer stopped the car. Because defendant continued to reach across his body with his right hand, the officer became concerned for his own safety and requested that defendant exit the vehicle. Defendant was wearing a bulky jacket on a July morning. A pat-down search revealed first a cigar tube containing crack cocaine, then a pistol. A warrants check revealed that defendant had outstanding warrants for his arrest. Defendant was also cited for a seat belt violation. The appellate court held the commission of the traffic offense gave the officer the legal right to stop the car. Defendant's failure to wear his seat belt provided the officer with the authority to issue him a citation. Removal of defendant from the car was appropriate. Regardless of whether the initial frisk was proper, the inevitable discovery doctrine applied, as there was a reasonable probability that, independent of the search, the drugs and the weapon would have been discovered after the officer issued the citation for the seat belt violation. Hence, the trial court correctly denied the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with sexual battery on a person who was mentally defective. The State filed a petition for writ of certiorari because the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), granted defendant's motion to strike the State's notice given under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(24)(b) (2001) and declared the statute unconstitutional as it concerned disabled adults.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court agreed with the trial judge that the ch. 90.803(24) provision for disabled adults suffered from the same constitutional shortcomings identified by the Supreme Court of Florida with respect to the elderly person exception to the hearsay rule, as (1) the exception applied to a broad class of adult declarants; (2) the scope of the testimony admissible under the exception could apply to any act of abuse or neglect, any act of exploitation, the offense of battery or aggravated battery or assault or aggravated assault or sexual battery, or any violent act on the declarant disabled adult; (3) the factors set forth in ch. 90.803(24)(a)(1) for the court to consider when assessing the reliability of the hearsay statement did not guarantee the reliability of a statement when applied to a disabled adult; and (4) the policies that supported upholding the narrowly drawn child abuse hearsay exception were not present in the broadly defined, disabled adult context.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County (Florida), entered a final judgment of involuntary commitment of defendant under the Ryce Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 394.917 (1999). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the Ryce Act was unconstitutional in that it violated double jeopardy and was an ex post facto law, violated due process protections, and violated his equal protection rights. The appellate court noted that the Florida Supreme Court had upheld the Ryce Act's constitutionality, and rejected defendant's arguments. The Ryce Act abrogated the psychotherapist-patient privilege. The provisions which waived confidentiality during treatment did not render the Ryce Act a violation of the right to privacy. The State had a compelling interest in the long-term control, care, and treatment of sexually violent predators and accomplished its goal through the use of the least intrusive means. The Fifth Amendment privilege had no application in commitment proceedings so long as the proceedings did not entangle defendant in any criminal prosecution. Actuarials were generally accepted in the relevant scientific community as part of the overall risk assessment for sexual predators, so the trial court did not err in admitting expert testimony to predict defendant's likelihood of reoffending.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the employee's tort claims were barred by the exclusivity provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11(4) (2000). All of the allegations of the complaint related to defendants' alleged breach of contractual obligations under the workers' compensation policy; since no independent acts were alleged, there was no independent tort.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that they should have been given an opportunity to amend their complaint challenging the constitutionality of one of Florida's specialty license plates. The appellate court held that the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing with prejudice counts III and V without considering the Kozel factors. The factors were not met, as appellants offered a reasonable justification for their noncompliance with the order, counsel had not been previously sanctioned, the client was not involved in drafting the pleading, and neither appellees nor the trial court were prejudiced by any delay. The trial court also erred in dismissing counts I and IV. Appellees did not move to dismiss count I. Further, counts I or IV should not have been dismissed with prejudice as appellants had not abused their privilege to amend, and there was no showing of prejudice. Count II, alleging a violation of appellants' free speech rights, was properly dismissed with prejudice, as there was no indication that appellants had applied for, and been denied, a &quot;pro-choice&quot; license plate, making any right to amend the count futile.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Gadsden County, Florida, of four counts of election code violations. He appealed, arguing, inter alia, that two statutes pursuant to which he was charged, Fla. Stat. chs. 104.061(1) and 104.0515(3) (1999), were unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly influenced voters to cast absentee ballots for the candidate he favored. He argued the terms &quot;intimidate&quot; in ch. 104.0515, and &quot;threat,&quot; &quot;other corruption,&quot; and &quot;menace&quot; in Fla. Stat. ch. 104.061 were unconstitutionally vague, and that both statutes prohibited acts that were protected by federal law. The appellate court disagreed. These words conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct, and the statutes clearly prohibited conduct that could never be considered constitutionally protected. Defendant's claim of error for failing to sever the counts was not preserved, and failed on its merits. Allowing tally sheets into evidence was proper to rebut defendant's suggestion that a State witness was biased against defendant by showing that the witness had grounds to challenge defendant's actions. But defense counsel's questioning of this witness did not open the door to his testifying on redirect about a third party's being convicted of election law violations in a prior election, and it was reversible error to admit this highly prejudicial evidence. The trial court properly refused to give defendant's proffered, misleading jury instruction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant to five concurrent habitual felony offender sentences of life in prison. Defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a). The trial court denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentencing court had the authority to sentence defendant as a habitual felony offender for his life felonies, pursuant to Fla.

Because defendant's life felonies were committed on January 27, 1997, during the October 1, 1995, and May 24, 1997, window period, the habitual felony offender sentences imposed had to be reversed. On remand, defendant was to be resentenced under the 1994 version of the sentencing guidelines, as his offense date was also within the window period for relief. In addition, the trial court at resentencing had the discretion to impose an upward departure sentence if one or more permissible reasons were applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the trial court's finding that 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 225 violated the single subject rule of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The appellate court held that each section of the act was logically connected to the subject expressed in the title. The act addressed only civil litigation. It did not contain any provisions unrelated to the act's subject. Further, the individual provisions promoted the legislation's goal.  Fla. Stat. ch. 324.021 (2000) did not violate the right of access to the courts under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The statute did not violate the Kruger test; the statute merely capped the damages for vicarious liability of a lessor of a rental car. The statute did not violate the right to a jury trial under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. A jury retained the ability to assess all damages against those at fault.  Fla. Stat. ch. 324.021 (2000) merely limited a plaintiff's available damages from the owner of a vehicle. The personal representative failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that ch. 324.021 violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Florida Constitution, and did not overcome the presumption that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the motion was reversed. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation's complaint sought protection from the enforcement of a recorded tax warrant, and release of funds allegedly due and payable in Broward County, Florida, and which were being withheld by the Comptroller for the Florida Department of Revenue's upon direction of the Department, pursuant to that warrant. The corporation sought to have the tax warrant declared invalid, and injunctive relief to protect him from the Department's efforts to enforce the tax warrant. The action was for declaratory judgment to obtain direct judicial protection from the enforcement of the tax warrant filed by the Department in Broward County. Therefore the sword-wielder exception to the home venue privilege applied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant appealed from an order by the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) declaring him to be a sexually violent predator and committing him indefinitely to the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services in a civil commitment action instituted pursuant to the Involuntary Civil Commitment for Sexually Violent Predators' Treatment and Care Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 394.910 et seq. (1999).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the instruction given was wrong under Crane. The appellate court held that Crane required that there be a finding that the subject had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. The jury was instructed that it was to consider appellant's emotional or volitional capacity which predisposed him to commit sexually violent offenses. There was no specific jury instruction required. Rather, there had to be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior in order to civilly commit an individual as a sexually violent predator. The Constitution's liberty safeguards in the area of mental illness were not best enforced through bright-line rules. The instruction given encompassed the requirements for civil commitment and contained the definitions for mental abnormality or personality disorder and likely to engage in acts of sexual violence. The jury was adequately instructed with respect to appellant's volitional capacity to control his behavior. Appellant's claim that the Act violated the Double Jeopardy and Ex Post Facto Clauses of the Florida and Federal Constitutions was rejected.</SPAN></P>

At sentencing, the State argued that victim injury points should be assessed on the guidelines scoresheet. The trial court assessed points for the murder conviction, but not for the false imprisonment conviction. Defendant appealed and the State cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State claimed that the trial court erred when it refused to assess on the sentencing guidelines scoresheet victim injury points for distinct injuries sustained by a single victim as the result of separate offenses. The appellate court held that because Hudson failed to recognize the effect of the clear language of the applicable rule of criminal procedure requiring that victim injury points be scored for each offense even if only a single victim is involved, it would recede from that decision. However, the appellate court held that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.703(d)(9) required the trial court to score victim injury points for injuries sustained by the victim and attributable to both the false imprisonment and the third-degree murder convictions. Additionally, defendant failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion regarding the convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed. However, the sentence was vacated and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Indian River County (Florida), which dismissed its 11-count complaint alleging inverse condemnation of its property by appellees, a city and a town, concluding the property owner's claims were not ripe since it had not obtained a final determination of the uses that would be permitted on the islands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's property consisted of inner and outer islands. The allegations stated that all or substantially all of the economic value of the property had been taken. The appellate court concluded the claim did not state a facial takings claim because the mere enactment of the regulations did not preclude all development in all cases. The regulations did not prohibit all development of the inner islands. The property owner did not demonstrate that a particular location was the only location to construct a bridge to the outer islands. Thus, there was no facial taking. The property owner admitted it made no application for development of the outer islands within the city. Thus, an as-applied challenge was not ripe. Nothing in the record suggested that some development would not be permitted on the outer island with access by ferry or other boat. However, further applications to develop the inner islands would have been futile. Since the &quot;bridgehead&quot; ordinance substantially diminished access to the islands, there was a taking of access claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner's complaint stated causes of actions for as-applied takings claims of the inner islands but not the outer islands and for a taking of access claim. It did not state a cause of action for a facial takings claim or the other claims raised. Thus, the trial court was reversed and the matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 843.02 (2002). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment, contending that the trial court erred by denying his motions for acquittal where his actions, the use of profanity and the refusal to obey police officers' orders to leave a public place, were not punishable conduct under Fla. Stat. ch. 843.02 (2002). The appeals court disagreed. The defense did not dispute the fact that the law enforcement officers were engaged in the lawful execution of a legal duty, the execution of a search warrant. However, the parties did not agree as to whether defendant's actions constituted obstruction or resistance of the lawful duty. But, he was not arrested for merely cursing at law enforcement officers. His arrest stemmed from his refusal to leave the nearby area where a SWAT team was attempting to execute a narcotics search warrant. Defendant was standing directly across the street from the front door of the residence that the police were going to search. Therefore, he was in the direct line of fire if the occupants of that residence would have fired weapons upon the SWAT team's execution of the narcotics search warrant. His presence thus made it more difficult for the officers to do their job.</SPAN></P>

The maternal grandmother's motion failed to state that any detriment would occur to the child if the grandmother was denied visitation, but merely alleged that the grant of visitation would be in the best interest of the child.

Further, he failed to establish that allowing his deposition in this unique proceeding was a violation of equal protection, and there was no authority for providing a defendant in a civil proceeding a blanket right of privacy such that no questions could be asked of him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was adjudicated guilty of second degree murder, a first degree felony, and was sentenced to 22 years incarceration. The Circuit Court for Volusia County, Florida, denied defendant's motion for relief under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For his argument, defendant relied on the holding in Heggs v. State, 759 So. 2d 620 (2000), that the 1995 amendments to the sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional when enacted, because the legislation violated the single-subject rule of the state constitution. The trial court treated defendant's Heggs issue as a Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(a) motion in denying relief. The appellate court held that, in raising his Heggs issue, defendant should have brought it within 2 years of the date his judgment and sentence became final. Defendant should have filed the Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motion by June 5, 1999. The instant motion was not filed until February 6, 2002. As the trial court prepared a new scoresheet using the 1994 sentencing guidelines, and determined that the sentencing range under the corrected scoresheet was 13.3 years to 22.17 years, defendant's sentence of 22 years was appropriate under the 1994 guidelines and did not constitute a departure sentence. Thus, while the trial court should have denied defendant's motion as untimely, trial properly denied the motion based on the fact that the sentence was not a departure sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation appealed an order of appellee Florida Department of Transportation, which concluded that the corporation's billboard was not located on the premises of a business and, therefore, required a sign permit pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 479.07 (2001).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the corporation argued for the first time that Fla. Stat. chs. 479.07, 479.08 (2001), as well as Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 14-10.004, 14-10.006, imposed a facially unconstitutional prior restraint on speech in violation of the First Amendment. The question was whether the regulations improperly restricted all offsite commercial signs. The appellate court concluded that the statutes and rules related to 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 131 of the federal Highway Beautification Act of 1965. The regulations directly advanced the goals of traffic safety and appearance of the highway by limiting the spacing between billboards and the structural characteristics of such billboards along the Florida State Highway System. Finally, the permitting regulations did not reach further than necessary to accomplish their given objective. The regulations did not ban all outdoor advertising signs. They merely limited the size and spacing of the signs to accomplish the government's aesthetic interests. Thus, Fla. Stat. chs. 479.07, 479.08, and Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 14-10.004, 14-10.006, did not impose an impermissible prior restraint on commercial speech and were facially constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator's driver's license was permanently revoked pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.28(2)(e) (1995). The operator had been convicted four times of driving under the influence.  Fla. Stat. ch. 322.28(2)(e) was amended to mandate the permanent revocation of a driver's license upon a fourth conviction of driving under the influence. Nevertheless, the Department issued the operator a regular driver's license and subsequently renewed it when she requested such by mail. When the Department realized its mistake, it issued the operator a notice of cancellation of her license. The appellate court held that since the operator had not applied for a hardship license prior to the date the law changed, the trial court directed the Department to afford the operator a remedy which she herself did not pursue prior to the change in the law that foreclosed her from obtaining a hardship license. The Department's mistake in issuing the operator a license almost five months after the law changed did not deprive the operator of the opportunity to apply for a hardship license before the law changed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that (1) the possession charge should be dismissed because the dual convictions violated double jeopardy; and (2) the sentence imposed was illegal. The appellate court concluded that it was not necessary to decide whether defendant's convictions violated double jeopardy because the record indicated that defendant entered into a bargained-for plea agreement which thereby waived her right to make a double jeopardy challenge to the convictions and sentence on appeal. Even if the plea agreement was not bargained for, defendant was precluded from challenging her convictions based on a double jeopardy violation because she did not reserve the right to appeal. Also, defendant's initial brief was filed after the effective date of the amendments to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b); consequently, her claim of sentencing error, even if fundamental, was not preserved for appellate review and defendant was precluded from raising the issue for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, three members of Congress and a qualified voter, challenged the Florida Legislature's reapportionment of their Congressional districts following the 2000 census. Appellants sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), which dismissed the action. Appellant President of the Florida Senate appealed the order which denied his motion to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court dismissed the action on the grounds that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear claims involving the reapportionment of congressional districts. The appellate court concluded that the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction. The Florida Supreme Court's review under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16, was limited to claims of facial invalidity involving the one-person, one-vote principle as well as the specific districting requirements of the state constitution. All as-applied constitutional and Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1971 et seq., challenges had to be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. Under Florida law, the circuit courts were competent to hear these claims. Under federal law there was a strong policy of deference to the state courts for the resolution of even congressional redistricting challenges. State courts could not close their doors to such claims even where the basis for the challenge was under federal law. In addition, the appellate court found that while the President of the Florida Senate was not an indispensable party to the gerrymandering claim, he was a proper party with a cognizable interest in the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) as to his sentence following a remand from the appellate court on convictions for trafficking in cocaine and conspiracy to traffic in cocaine. Defendant asserted that his prior convictions were improperly scored.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgments used by the State to score defendant's prior record reflected that defendant was previously convicted of four counts of robbery with a firearm, eight counts of robbery with a weapon, one count of simple robbery, and one count of carrying a concealed firearm. The State scored the eight convictions for robbery with a weapon as &quot;level 9&quot; offenses rather than &quot;level 8&quot; offenses. That error resulted in a 32 point increase on defendant's scoresheet. The State also scored the concealed firearm conviction as a &quot;level 4&quot; offense rather than a &quot;level 5&quot; offense, resulting in a 1.2 point decrease on defendants' scoresheet. The scoring errors meant that the trial court sentenced defendant based on incorrect guidelines scoresheet calculations. Neither the transcript of the resentencing hearing nor anything else in the record showed whether the trial court would have imposed the same sentence if it had had an accurate scoresheet. Therefore, the error could not be deemed harmless. Any ambiguity or uncertainty in the scoring of a defendant's prior record had to be resolved in favor of the defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee organizations sued appellant State of Florida in the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) for a declaratory judgment that 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 225 was unconstitutional. The State and appellant intervenors moved to dismiss the suit. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and entered summary judgment declaring 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 225 unconstitutional for covering more than a single subject. The State and the intervenors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida Legislature enacted 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 225, a bill that addressed multiple aspects of civil litigation. The organizations contended the bill violated the single-subject requirement of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 by embracing a myriad of subjects and thereby becoming a vehicle for logrolling by a variety of special interests that sought specific and unrelated protections from liability concerns. The trial court determined that declaratory relief was appropriate under the ripening seeds of controversy theory. On appeal, the court found that in upholding a complaint that was utterly devoid of any allegation of a present controversy, and that failed to name a person who had any actual adverse interest in the subject matter of the litigation, the trial court misapplied the ripening seeds of controversy doctrine. The asserted claims of injury below were nonspecific and hypothetical, and did no more than question the constitutionality of the bill based on vague, general fears of possible future harm. The allegations were grounded on speculation and hypothesis. Such allegations did not make out a proper case for the exercise of the court's declaratory judgment power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The final summary judgment granting declaratory relief was reversed, and the cause was remanded to the trial court with directions to dismiss the complaint with prejudice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest in the County Court for Collier County (Florida) to driving under the influence. The trial court imposed probation and ordered a 10-day impoundment of the vehicle driven by defendant, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(6)(a) (2000). Defendant moved to declare the vehicle impoundment provision unconstitutional. The trial court granted defendant's motion. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the vehicle impoundment provision was unconstitutional on the grounds that, as applied, the statute violated his right to due process and equal protection. Defendant presented undisputed testimony that the vehicle he had been driving at the time of the offense was owned by another and had been a company vehicle. The lease on the vehicle had since expired, and defendant did not own or possess any vehicles. On appeal, the court found that the impoundment provision was not applicable because the vehicle defendant was driving at the time of the offense had no unexpired term remaining on the lease and defendant had no vehicles registered in his name. The trial court erred in construing the statute to require impoundment as a condition of probation under the circumstances. Because the statute did not apply to defendant, the appellate court did not address the merits of the constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions that the impoundment condition be stricken from defendant's probation order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida).

The general definition of cannabis did not require a distinction between processed and unprocessed cannabis. Merely because the legislature had since also defined &quot;cannabis plant&quot; did not detract from the general definition of cannabis. By not changing the general definition of cannabis, it was clear that the legislature did not mean to prohibit a trafficking charge based on the weight of a combination of processed and unprocessed cannabis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge characterized the neurosurgeon as a &quot;liar,&quot; and would not allow him to testify as an expert witness at a trial. The neurosurgeon asserted that the judge's statements injured his reputation, severely impaired his ability to obtain employment as an expert witness, and caused him to be discharged by the defense. The appellate court held that the trial court properly dismissed the claim for relief under the stigma-plus test for 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, as the neurosurgeon did not allege the deprivation of a constitutionally protected property or liberty interest. To establish a procedural due process claim under &sect; 1983, a plaintiff had to show the deprivation of a liberty or property interest protected by the Due Process Clause. Although the defamatory statements were made to the neurosurgeon's employer, resulted in the loss of employment, and impaired his ability to obtain employment, they did not violate a due process right. The judge did not alter a legal status by barring the neurosurgeon from testifying in a single case. At best, the neurosurgeon established a temporary, partial loss of income that did not invoke the protection of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving after his license was permanently revoked, driving while license revoked as a habitual offender, resisting an officer without violence, and possession of less than 20 grams of cannabis. The Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) denied defendant's motion to suppress and defendant was convicted of, inter alia, driving after his license had been permanently revoked. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued on appeal that (1) his suppression motion should have been granted because the police stopped him without a lawful reason, making his subsequent arrest and the search of his person and vehicle illegal; and (2) his conviction of driving after his license had been permanently revoked was erroneous. The appellate court found competent, substantial evidence to support the trial judge's conclusion that the encounter between the police and defendant was consensual. Therefore, the suppression motion was properly denied. However, the appellate agreed with defendant that his conviction for driving after his license had been permanently revoked pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.341 (2001) was erroneous in light of the appellate court's opinion in a prior case that was decided after the judgment. In that prior case, the appellate court had held that 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 223, which enacted Fla. Stat. ch. 322.241, was unconstitutional. That prior decision required defendant's conviction for driving after his license was permanently revoked to be vacated. However, since a different district appellate court had reached a contrary result, certification of a conflict was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress, vacated defendant's conviction for driving after his license was permanently revoked, certified a conflict with another appellate opinion relevant to the decision to vacate defendant's conviction for driving after his license was permanently revoked, and affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The Florida Supreme Court declined to exercise discretionary jurisdiction to review the order under the pass through provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amendment would have modified the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment in Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17 and had been approved by the voters in the 1998 general election under a different ballot summary, which was found to be deficient. The court concluded that the current ballot summary accurately described the amendment. All of the deficiencies identified in the previous summary were corrected. The ballot summary removed any uncertainty about its impact on constitutional rights and indicated clearly that the effect of the proposed amendment would reduce the rights of Floridians to the minimum rights afforded by the Eighth Amendment. The ballot summary also no longer suggested that the proposed change would apply only the death penalty but made clear that the proposed change could be applied to any form of criminal punishment. The summary did not violate Fla. Stat. ch. 101.161(1) (2000) or the Florida Constitution. The supervisors' contention that the summary was too long was rejected, as a joint resolution of the legislature was excepted from the size constraints. The supervisors lacked standing to raise an equal protection contest.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the rule was not unconstitutional as it did not operate as a prior restraint on speech; the rule operated as a warning that time, place, and manner restrictions could apply to a free speech activity; the rule was not concerned with the content of the expression but with the operation of the parks; the rule was content-neutral; the rule was narrowly-tailored; and the rule left open ample, alternative channels for communication.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant workers' compensation claimant appealed from a decision by the Florida judge of compensation claims (JCC) finding that the claimant committed workers' compensation fraud under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.105(4)(b)1 and 2, and terminating the claimant's workers' compensation benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The JCC determined that the claimant committed workers' compensation fraud by altering a prescription for a pain-killer. The appellate court held that the claimant's loss of benefits was not a penalty or fine so extreme that it violated the claimant's due process rights, and passed even the strict scrutiny test, although that test was inapplicable. The claimant's constitutional right to a jury trial or access to the courts under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 21, 22, was not denied. The worker's compensation system was a valid alternative to the courts system. The legislature's investment of the JCC with the authority to determine whether a claimant had committed fraud in obtaining workers' compensation benefits was not a violation of Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. Under the Workers' Compensation Act, the JCC, not the courts, determined an injured worker's entitlement to benefits. By making the factual determination of whether a claimant committed fraud to obtain benefits, the JCC did no more than make the determination of the worker's entitlement to benefits under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.09.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 2122.055(5)(e) (2000) (surtax amendment) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On May 5, 2000, the Florida Legislature amended Fla. Stat. ch. 212.055(5) to add subparagraph (e) and require that the county was to create a nominating board to administer funds diverted from public hospitals to private hospitals. The county determined that it would not comply with the surtax amendment and abolished the governing board created by the surtax amendment. The appellate court held that the surtax amendment was an unconstitutional special law, as it only applied to the county. The provision could not be severed, as the legislature intended that the surtax amendment would apply only to the county. Therefore, severing the unconstitutional provision regarding the &quot;nominating committee&quot; would defeat the legislature's &quot;clear purpose in enacting the statute.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The trial court thereafter entered an order granting a judgment of acquittal. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the sole evidence supporting the conviction was uncorroborated statements of the five-year-old daughter of defendant. The trial court found that the child's testimony had been coached and, although there had been no objection, that it should not have been admitted. The trial court further found that if it had been admitted, it was insufficient to support the conviction. The appellate court ruled that in resisting a judgment of acquittal, the State was allowed to rely on any evidence adduced, even evidence later determined to have been inadmissible. The ruling on a motion for a judgment of acquittal did not call for the exercise of judicial discretion. If the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction, the trial court had no discretion to acquit an accused. Absent fundamental error, a trial court was not allowed to grant even a timely motion for new trial based solely on the inadmissibility of prejudicial evidence to which defense counsel did not adequately object. Whatever its weight, the evidence that the State adduced at trial &quot;touched all the bases&quot; necessary to make out a sufficient prima facie case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was injured when he fell from a trailer. Compensability for appellee's injuries turned on the issue of whether appellee was a statutory employee at the time of his injury. The JCC found that appellee was a sole proprietor actively engaged in the construction industry and, therefore, an &quot;employee&quot; under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.02(14)(c). On appeal the court reversed. The court rejected the contention of the employer and the carrier that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.02(7), (14)(c) was unconstitutionally vague. Although it was undisputed that appellee was a sole proprietor, the court determined that the JCC's finding that appellee was actively engaged in the construction industry was not supported by competent, substantial evidence. The court ruled that appellee's testimony that he was hauling construction and demolition materials at the time of the accident was not sufficient to satisfy appellee's evidentiary burden of showing he was engaged in the construction industry. The court noted that there was no evidence concerning the source of the materials and what activities were occurring, if any, at the sites that the materials came from.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Count one was an action filed pursuant to the Development Agreement Act (Act), Fla. Stat. chs. 163.3220- 163.3243 (1999), challenging compliance of the agreement with the city's comprehensive plan. Count two was an action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, which alleged that the agreement was unconstitutional. Count four was a taxpayer's action challenging the city's obligation in the agreement to expend city funds as an unconstitutional exercise of the city's taxing and spending powers. The trial court dismissed counts two and four on the ground that the association and the owners lacked standing. The appellate court held that the owners were within the class of property owners the city determined should have been provided notice of the public hearings pertaining to approval of the development agreement. Thus, their interests were sufficient to confer standing to seek a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of the development agreement. The association was formed to protect the property owners' interests, and therefore, it had standing to maintain count two. The taxpayer's status as a city resident did provide him standing to maintain count four.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father, a polygamist, lived with the mother, their seven children, his second wife, and her daughter. With the mother's blessing, he &quot;married&quot; his 12-year-old daughter and his 15-year-old step-daughter. The trial court found that he had sex with his daughter, and terminated the parents' rights as to her. But it declined to terminate their rights as to the other children, citing the absence of evidence that the parents posed a substantial risk of imminent harm to any of the boys, and noting that, as the other daughter did not live at home, termination was not the &quot;least restrictive means&quot; of protecting her. The appellate court reversed. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.806, &quot;egregious abuse&quot; directed at one sibling was sufficient to support termination of parental rights to the other children, without proof that the other children would likely be abused. As to the remaining daughter, the concept of &quot;least restrictive means&quot; did not oblige the trial court to give the parents a performance agreement or placement plan before termination could occur, because, in such extraordinary circumstances, termination without such plans or agreements was the least restrictive means.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The termination of the parents' rights as to their daughter was affirmed, but the portion of the judgment denying termination of their rights as to their other children was reversed, and the case was remanded for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. X, &sect; 9. The effect of art. X, &sect; 9, was to give to all criminal legislation a prospective effectiveness; the repeal or amendment, by subsequent legislation, of a pre-existing criminal statute did not become effective, either as a repeal or as an amendment of such pre-existing statute, in so far as offenses were concerned that had been committed prior to the taking effect of such repealing or amending law. Accordingly, the conviction was reversed and the case was remanded for a new trial before a jury that was instructed that in order to convict, defendant must have known the transferred substance was cocaine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner county sought a writ of prohibition, seeking review of an order of respondent, the Secretary of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), which denied the county's motion for disqualification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue involved an application to the (DEP) for an environmental resource permit to conduct phosphate mining activities on property. At the time the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) recommended that the order be issued, the secretary issued a statement as to whether the DEP followed the applicable law in granting the permit. The county moved for the secretary's disqualification based on the statement, arguing that it reasonably believed that it could not receive a fair and impartial hearing from the agency head on its exceptions to the recommended order. The appellate court held that, at the time the statements, the secretary was not acting in the role of investigator, prosecutor, or a person responsible for determining probable cause. The timing and content of the secretary's statement were inconsistent with his role of adjudicator. The agency head's perceived need to act in his political capacity was outweighed by the need for parties to believe they were involved in a fair process. Thus, the motion was legally sufficient and should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 395.0197(6) (1997). The Agency accepted the administrative law judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law that the Agency had justification to levy an administrative fine against the hospital. The hospital appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital failed to report as a Code 15 occurrence a hypoxic event, the disconnection of a patient from a ventilator machine, that caused brain damage to the patient. The hospital's administration decided not to report the event to the Agency as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 395.0197 because the patient's condition returned to baseline, neurologically stable. The Agency determined that the event caused brain damage and should have been reported. The hospital contended that the Agency's construction and interpretation of the term &quot;brain damage&quot; were impermissible because they were inconsistent with the plain meaning of ch. 395.0197(6) and that the Agency's construction and interpretation of the term &quot;brain damage&quot; were vague and unconstitutional as applied. On appeal, the court found that the Agency's construction and interpretation of ch. 395.0197 were not vague and were not unconstitutionally applied to the hospital. Further, by not reporting the ventilator incident as a Code 15 occurrence, the hospital clearly violated ch. 395.0197.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to the offense of aggravated battery with a firearm. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment with a three-year minimum mandatory term of imprisonment, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.087(2) (1999). Defendant appealed the order of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida), which denied his motion to correct an illegal sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that his sentence was illegal, as it included the three-year minimum mandatory. He believed that the Taylor decision rendered Fla. Stat. ch. 775.087(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional. Taylor held that 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 was unconstitutionally enacted in violation of the single-subject rule. The appellate court concluded that it did not need to decide how recent legislation might affect the Taylor decision or even whether Taylor rendered Fla. Stat. ch. 775.087(2)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The Taylor decision announced that the validly enacted statutes in effect at the time of the offense would control sentencing. The three-year minimum mandatory sentence for use of a firearm during the commission of aggravated battery existed prior to 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188. Thus, defendant's sentence was legal, even if Fla. Stat. ch. 775.087(2) was the controlling statute.</SPAN></P>

Two months later, the girlfriend recanted a portion of her previous statement. The question was whether there was a legitimate forensic purpose for calling the girlfriend as a witness at trial. The appellate court found that the judge and the parties agreed that there was a legitimate purpose for calling the girlfriend as a witness, and that she was not being called for the sole or primary purpose of putting impeachment evidence before the jury. As that was so, the girlfriend fell within the general rule that the party calling the witness should usually be permitted to impeach the witness with a prior inconsistent statement. In addition, the State argued that the girlfriend's original statement that defendant told her over the phone that he shot the victim should be admissible as a statement by the girlfriend of identification of a person made after perceiving the person, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 90.801(2)(c). The appellate court concluded that what the State was trying to bring in through the detective, however, was the girlfriend's statement to the detective that defendant admitted shooting the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Levy County (Florida), following a non-jury trial, held that defendant qualified as a &quot;sexually violent predator&quot; as that term was defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 394.912(10) (2000), and committed him to the custody of the department of children and family services for control, care, and treatment in a secure facility pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 394.917(2) (2000). Defendant's appeal primarily concerned his commitment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of sexual battery and of attempted sexual acts with a child. Psychologists testified he had a personality disorder &quot;not otherwise specified,&quot; which meant that he had a history of both antisocial and borderline personality traits that placed him at significant risk for reoffending. There was a reasonable degree of psychological certainty that he was likely to commit further acts of sexual violence if he was not incarcerated in a treatment program. The appeals court, in reversing for a new trial, found the Jimmy Ryce Act, specifically Fla. Stat. ch. 394, pt. V, did not deprive defendant of substantive due process. It required proof by only clear and convincing evidence, did not expressly provide for consideration of less restrictive alternatives to involuntary confinement, and did not require a showing that a threat of imminent danger existed absent confinement. The Act was not unconstitutionally vague, was civil in nature, and did not violate the Equal Protection, Ex Post Facto, and Double Jeopardy Clauses. The trial court found the three Hendricks elements but not the recently required fourth Crane element for confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court found the Act violated substantive due process as applied to defendant because the trial court did not find the fourth required element (not required at the time of his trial) for his commitment, that he was suffering from serious difficulty in controlling behavior, reversed and remanded the case for a new trial on the issue of his commitment, and affirmed the remainder of the order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction and sentence by the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida) for the sale or delivery of cocaine and possession of cocaine. He asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, that the habitual felony offender statute violated Apprendi, and that the habitual felony offender statute offended due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers had approached defendant, as he fit the description of a man who had allegedly sold cocaine to an undercover officer. Defendant quickly reached into his pocket. As he was in close proximity to defendant and feared for his safety, an officer grabbed defendant's hand and pulled it from the pocket. The officer noticed that defendant was holding a vial in his hand. Upon opening the vial he found cocaine inside. The appellate court held that since the vial was of a type recognized by the officer as commonly packaging contraband, he had probable cause to conduct a search of the vial. Given the close proximity of the officer to defendant, defendant's furtive movement, the resemblance of the vial to containers known to contain cocaine, and the information that defendant had committed a felony, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress. The habitual felony offender statute did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to defendant and, therefore, did not violate due process, nor did it violate Apprendi.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and sentence for the sale or delivery of cocaine and possession of cocaine was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of a temporary injunction enjoining them from placing on the ballot as directed, an analysis and fiscal impact statement for any initiative approved by the Florida Supreme Court for the general election ballot for November 2002. Appellants requested the appellate court to certify the appeal as one requiring immediate resolution by the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its injunction, the trial court held unconstitutional that portion of 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 390 which required the inclusion of an analysis and fiscal impact statement for all proposed revisions or amendments to the state constitution by initiative on the November 2002 general election ballot. The appellate court held that if the injunction was allowed to stand, the trial court's order would thwart the legislature's intent to inform the electorate of the fiscal impact of revisions or amendments to the state constitution proposed by initiative. The result would be a less informed electorate. Because of this, the issues raised by the appeal were of great public importance to the people of the state. In addition, the time constraints created by the state elections laws required that the supreme court immediately resolve those issues, rather than permitting the normal appellate process to run its course. The appeal was appropriate for certification to the supreme court as one requiring immediate resolution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile entered a plea of nolo contendere to charges of burglary of a structure and possession of alcohol by a minor. The juvenile was ordered to submit two samples of blood for DNA testing. The juvenile moved to modify probation, arguing that the condition requiring her to submit the DNA samples should be eliminated. The Circuit Court for Citrus County (Florida) denied the motion and the juvenile appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DNA samples were ordered pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 943.325 (2000). The appellate court held the burglary charge fell within the definition of offenses addressed in Fla. Stat. ch. 810.02. The statute applied to both juveniles and adults committed to or under the supervision of the Department of Corrections or the Department of Juvenile Justice or committed to a county jail, Fla. Stat. ch. 943.325(1)(b) (2000). The appellate court held that according to the clear and plain meaning of the statutory language, Fla. Stat. ch. &sect; 943.325(1) only applied to convicted persons who were still incarcerated. Because the juvenile was not incarcerated, the only portion of the statute that arguably applied was Fla. Stat. ch. 943.325(2), which provided that a convicted person who was no longer incarcerated but was within the confines of the legal state boundaries and was on community control was required to submit two specimens of blood. Obviously, to be &quot;no longer incarcerated,&quot; one had to have been incarcerated. In the instant case, the juvenile was never incarcerated. Thus, the appellate court held the statute was inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The portion of the juvenile's sentence requiring her to submit the DNA blood samples was stricken. The remaining portion of the sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the widow of a decedent, appealed an order of the Judge of Compensation Claims (Florida) which found that the monetary limits of Fla. Stat. ch. 440.16(7) applied to the widow's claim for survivor's benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow applied for survivor's benefits in the amount of $ 100,000, the maximum allowed under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.16(1)(b). Respondents, employer and insurance carrier, sought to limit the total amount of claimant's potential recovery to $ 50,000 in accordance with Fla. Stat. ch. 440.16(7), which imposed that limit on the claim of aliens not residents (or about to become nonresidents) of the United States or Canada. The widow was apparently a citizen and resident of Mexico. An earlier version of the statute was held unconstitutional in DeAyala v. Florida Farm Bureau Casualty Insurance. However, the 1987 Florida Legislature had amended the statute by increasing the amount payable to nonresident aliens, but still leaving that amount to be less than that payable to residents of the United States and Canada. The trial judge noted that she did not have jurisdiction to declare a provision of the Florida Workers' Compensation Act unconstitutional, and accordingly held for respondents. The appellate court held that the monetary limitation of the current version of Fla. Stat. ch. 440.16(7) was unconstitutional in light of the unambiguous holding of DeAyala.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was illegally sentenced both as a habitual felony offender and also to a guidelines mitigated departure, and that because he was sentenced to a guidelines departure sentence under the unconstitutional 1995 guidelines, he had to be resentenced under the valid 1994 guidelines to a downward departure. The appellate court found that while the instant case was on appeal, the state supreme court held that a hybrid sentence, both guidelines and habitual, could be valid if it was the product of a plea which the defendant negotiated with the State. The portions of the record that were furnished to the appellate court did not establish whether or not defendant's sentence was the product of a negotiated plea. Defendant claimed he plead guilty without a plea bargain, and the State did not contradict that claim. Therefore, a remand was necessary on that issue. As to defendant's second claim, the appellate court held that the sentence imposed under the 1995 guidelines fell within the 1994 guidelines range. Therefore, relief on that claim was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's husband was a famous race car driver who was killed in a crash during a car race. The medical examiner performed an autopsy of the decedent. Autopsy photographs of the decedent were taken. The written autopsy report, post-crash photographs of the decedent's car, a toxicology report, and a sketch showing the markings on the decedent's body were made available to the public. The autopsy photographs, however, were not released. The widow and other family members did not want the autopsy photographs to be released to the public. The media company sought the autopsy photographs under the Florida Public Records Act. After the fatal accident, the Florida Legislature enacted Fla. Stat. ch. 406.135 (2001), which became effective when the governor signed it. That statute restricted the public's access to autopsy photographs upon the showing of good cause. On appeal, the court found that (1) the statute was not overly broad and was therefore constitutional; (2) the statute was to be applied retroactively; and (3) the trial court did not err in finding that the media company failed to establish good cause under the statute to allow inspection and copying of the photographs.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendant's motion to correct illegal sentence, and, without defendant being present or represented by counsel, resentenced defendant as a habitual offender to 30 years on aggravated battery and 10 years on the attempted robbery. The appellate court reversed defendant's sentence since neither defendant nor counsel were present at the re-sentencing. Defendant appeared in the trial court for resentencing. Over defendant's objection, and without appointing counsel, the trial court resentenced defendant to 30 years as a habitual offender on the aggravated battery and 10 years on the attempted robbery. The public defender's office was ultimately appointed to represent defendant on appeal. The State conceded that resentencing defendant without the benefit of counsel was error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A successor judge conducted the resentencing, and defendant objected to the successor judge's failure to review the trial transcript. The appellate court held that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.700(c) required a successor judge to become acquainted with the trial, or the facts concerning the plea and the offense. A successor judge could receive a proffer or statement of proceedings covering the relevant proceedings if the judge also reviewed the presentence investigation report and the pertinent parts of the file. A review of the trial transcript satisfied the rule, but was not necessitated by it. It was insufficient, however, to merely rely on an order of the trial judge that did not contain the information about what transpired at trial, or the facts, including any plea discussions. The appellate court was unable to discern what the successor judge reviewed. If, in fact, he did review the file, including the presentence investigation report, then this needed to be clearly stated for the record. If he did not, then more than mere reliance on a prior order needed to be done to comply with the rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (DOA) appealed a non-final order of the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), which held unconstitutional various aspects of 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 11, the 2002 amendments codified in Fla. Stat. chs. 581.184, 933.02; enjoined the DOA from enforcing the statute as written; and placed several limitations on its power to seek search warrants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order concluded that the 2002 statutory amendments, dealing with the DOA's authority to eradicate citrus canker, impaired important constitutional rights of property owners of citrus trees throughout the state. The DOA suggested an immediate transfer of the appeal under Fla. R. App. P. 9.125 to the supreme court, arguing there existed an emergency in Florida as a result of the continuing spread of citrus canker which was threatening the state's citrus industry. Appellee individuals responded that a transfer to the supreme court would be improvident, arguing the order in question was nonfinal, merely granting a temporary injunction to preserve the status quo. The appellate court determined the constitutionality issues, under 2002 Fla. Laws ch. 11, had for all practical purposes been finally declared and adjudicated by the trial judge, and was subject to plenary review. In addition, the appellate court considered that its word was most unlikely to be the final one. The appellate court reasoned that whether it agreed that the statutory scheme was invalid or not, it would certify the case to the supreme court as being of great public importance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court certified the appeal required immediate resolution by the supreme court because the issues pending in the trial court were of great public importance or would have a great effect on the proper administration of justice throughout the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual sued the city in federal court, claiming that a city resolution was unconstitutional. The city met with its attorneys behind closed doors to discuss settlement negotiations and strategy in connection with the federal lawsuit. After the meeting, the city's attorney served on the individual an offer of judgment in which the city offered to settle the matter by amending the resolution. The city then held an open public meeting in which it formally adopted the amended resolution. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order of summary final judgment against the individual and found that the actions taken by the city were valid and not in violation of the Florida Sunshine Law. The record reflected that the subject matter of the settlement meeting was confined to settlement negotiations or strategy sessions related to litigation expenditures. The discussion with the attorneys at the closed session was proper. The city, in an abundance of caution, and in order to cure any possible Sunshine Law defect, observed all legal requirements, and cured any possible defect that may have existed in formally adopting the amended resolution at an open public meeting.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A public body created by the Florida Legislature owned the subject property and leased it to the business. During the disputed tax years, the business operated a public golf course on the property, which the business believed entitled it to a public purpose ad valorem tax exemption. On review, however, the appraiser determined that, even though the golf course was open to the public and the property was publicly owned, the golf course was not entitled to the &quot;public purpose&quot; exemption, as the operator of the golf course was a for-profit business. The trial court found that, as the golf course was open to the public, regardless of the for-profit nature of the business, the golf course met the statutory definition of &quot;public purpose&quot; and was thus entitled to the exemption. The appellate court held that the business was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, as the operation of the golf course by the for-profit business fell within the definition of the governmental-proprietary operation, which was not a &quot;public purpose&quot; and was not entitled to an ad valorem tax exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior case law had determined that the 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 233 violated the single subject rule of Fla. Const. art.

The amendment stated in its title that one of its purposes was to provide for the suspension of driver's licenses for people who passed bad checks. Because a person who passed a bad check could lose his driver's license he could thereafter be arrested for driving without his license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxpayers filed a class action lawsuit in the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County (Florida) against appellant Florida Department of Revenue for tax refunds. The circuit court granted class certification to the taxpayers, granted their motion for summary judgment, denied the Department's motion for summary judgment, and entered a final judgment for the taxpayers. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers paid sales taxes, under Fla. Stat. ch. 212.0505 (1987) (repealed 1994), on illegal narcotics transactions. Most of the class members did not challenge the tax assessments within the time periods prescribed by Fla. Stat. ch. 72.011, providing an administrative remedy, or Fla. Stat. ch. 215.26 (2000), providing for applications for refund. After the tax was repealed, the taxpayers submitted refund requests to the Department. The Department denied the requests for refunds as being untimely filed under ch. 215.26(2), which required the taxpayers to file for refunds within three years of when the right to a refund accrued. The majority of the taxpayers also did not timely challenge the tax assessments under ch. 72.011(2). On appeal, the court found that ch. 215.26(2) provided that a lawsuit must be commenced within three years after the right to refund accrued. Further, the taxpayers' right to refunds accrued at the time the taxes were paid, not when ch. 212.0505 was declared unconstitutional. Therefore, the trial court erred in its decision, as the two named taxpayers in the suit did not file the action within three years of payment of the disputed tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of final summary judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By the time defendant stood trial, the Florida Supreme Court had issued its Delgado decision, which gave a new, binding construction of the burglary statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 810.02 (1999). Under the Delgado decision, the &quot;remaining in&quot; clause of the burglary statute was to be limited to a defendant who surreptitiously remained. Therefore, a defendant who did not intend to commit an offense upon entering a structure did not, having formed such an intent once inside, thereafter &quot;remain in&quot; the structure surreptitiously. The appellate court found that the Florida Legislature's attempt to nullify the Delgado decision did not affect the instant case. As such, the trial court should have instructed the jury in accordance with Delgado, which it failed to do. Inasmuch as the prosecutor argued in closing that the jury could convict on the very theory that Delgado disallowed, the error was not harmless. However, since defense counsel did not request an alternative instruction, did not object, and did not move for judgment of acquittal on grounds that the verdict might reflect jury findings of fact that did not amount to burglary, the issue was not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the ordinance attempted to restrict manufactured housing within a residentially zoned area which otherwise permitted on site construction. The county argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 553.38 was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous because it was internally contradictory and provided the department with unlimited enforcement authority to determine whether the county's requirements and rules were reasonable. The appellate court held that the constitutionality of statutes that required certain conduct to be reasonable under the particular circumstances were frequently upheld. The reasonableness contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 553.38 related to whether a requirement or rule distinguished between a conventionally constructed house and a manufactured building. Additionally, the statute did not contain contradictions where the first sentence reserved certain powers to local authorities, and the second sentence merely qualified that power by disallowing local rules that would have distinguished between the two types of construction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only address the owner of the apparently vacant property provided to the tax collector was that of the vacant property itself. Since it was a vacant lot, the address was invalid for receipt of mail and a notice to the owner of the application for tax by certified mail was returned undelivered. The sheriff, likewise, was unable to serve the owner. The buyers acquired title to the property pursuant to a tax deed after the sale of the property. The owner claimed that he was unaware of the notice and that Fla. Stat. ch. 197.502(4) was unconstitutional because due process required the clerk to make a good faith effort to locate and notify the owner that his property was about to be sold. He further claimed that he was the owner of a homestead parcel and had the tax rolls been searched, another address for him would have been found. On appeal, the court found no due process violation. The owner knew he owed taxes and had not paid taxes. No claim was made that the owner ever took any steps to provide a correct address to taxing authorities or discover why he was not receiving tax bills. Therefore, the owner had no right to complain that the clerk did not look hard enough for him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The woman's attorney communicated with a former managerial-level employee of the insurer who was then employed by a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurer. The witness gave a formal statement under oath to the attorney. Before the interview, the attorney researched Fla. R. Bar 4-4.2 and attempted to comply with the Rule. He sought an ethics advisory opinion from the Florida Bar before he proceeded. At the very beginning of the formal statement, he asked the witness if his then employer was a separate and distinct company from his former employer. The witness explained that his current employer was a subsidiary of the insurer. The corporations were formed in different states. On appeal, the court found that because the witness was not in a management position with the insurer, he was no longer able to make admissions binding on the insurer in his communications with the attorney. Hence, Rule 4-4.2 was not violated by the communications. Therefore, disqualifying the lawyer from the case could not be considered, as other remedies could mitigate any problem of unfairness that might later arise.</SPAN></P>

A warrant was issued for the fugitive's arrest and a federal grand jury indicted the fugitive. The fugitive stayed out of the United States and never submitted to the jurisdiction of the United States. After the forfeiture action was begun, the Florida Legislature passed Fla. Stat. ch. 896.106 (2000), which codified the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. The fugitive alleged the dismissal of his claim in the forfeiture proceeding violated his rights to due process and was a retroactive application of ch. 896.106. On appeal, the court found that enforcement of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine under ch. 896.106 did not violate due process. Further, the application of ch. 896.106 did not violate the rule against retroactive application of a statute as the fugitive's rights were not impaired by his conduct preceding the effective date of the statute, but by his absence after its effective date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile lived in an apartment with his mother.

The juvenile gave the deputies his name and told the deputies that he was not the person for whom they were looking. He also told them that the person they wanted to arrest was not in the apartment. The deputies asked if they could come in the apartment and search. The juvenile agreed to this. The deputies entered the apartment and found drug paraphernalia that the juvenile admitted belonged to him. On appeal, the court found that, because there was no evidence which could form a reasonable belief that the person to be arrested was present at the dwelling, the officers were not free to enter the premises based upon the arrest warrant. Their entry amounted to an unconstitutional intrusion under the Fourth Amendment. Further, the consent given was involuntary as a mere acquiescence to authority.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that, in Florida, the state must prove that the offender met the criteria of a habitual felony offender or habitual violent felony offender, pursuant to Fla.

Therefore, the state had the burden of proof, and there was no unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof to the defendant. The trial court used its discretion by finding that sentencing defendant as a violent career criminal was not necessary for the protection of the public. The habitual offender statute did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to the defendant, even though the statute no longer required a finding of necessity for protection of the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the beginning of defendant's trial for selling cocaine near a school, the trial court initiated a lengthy exchange with him regarding the benefits of accepting the State's four-year prison plea offer in lieu of proceeding to trial. Defendant declined the plea offer and elected to proceed to trial. After he was convicted, the trial court sentenced him to 40 years in prison. The appellate court found nothing in the record to show that defendant's insistence on a trial was not given consideration in the sentencing. There was no other reason for imposition of the harsh sentence and the trial court's comments on their face supported the presumption of judicial vindictiveness. The only possible conclusion was that the harsher sentence was imposed because defendant failed to accept the favorable plea bargain championed by the trial court prior to trial.</SPAN></P>

When the insured sought discovery pertaining to her bad faith claim, the insurer objected to the production of certain documents and to certain interrogatories. The trial court ordered the insurer to produce certain documents. The insurer filed a petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer claimed that the insured sought documents that were protected by the attorney-client and work product privileges. The insurer also claimed that the order improperly required disclosure of materials which could be used by the insured against it outside the context of the litigation. Finally, the insurer contended that it properly raised its privilege claim, in spite of not filing a privilege log. On appeal, the court found that the trial court erred in requiring the insurer to provide documents which on their face required disclosure of attorney-client communications without first conducting an in-camera inspection the documents. Further, the trial court erred in requiring the insurer to provide information which was not relevant to the litigation. The interrogatory requesting the information was overbroad and a fishing expedition, and should not have been allowed. Finally, the court rejected the insurer's claim that allowing the insured to pursue discovery on the issue of its bad faith without a determination of liability was a departure from the essential requirements of law.</SPAN></P>

The interlocutory appeal from that portion by which injunction relief was awarded followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agency contended that because funds accumulated in the Public Medical Assistance Trust Fund (PMATF) were earmarked for reimbursing Medicaid inpatient hospital costs, it derived no benefit commensurate with the burden imposed and was required to contribute where no such burden was placed upon the general public. Thus, it argued that its due process and equal protection guarantees were violated. This argument was compelling. A legislator could assume that appellee doctors provided the same or similar services, but that hospitals were forced to impose higher charges for services because they were burdened with the expense of indigent inpatient care. It was conceivable the legislature extended the PMATF assessment in order to level the economic playing field, which was a legitimate basis for upholding legislation. Even if the assumptions were erroneous, the fact that they were arguable was sufficient to immunize the choice from constitutional challenge. Thus, the trial court erred in awarding injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrative law judge (ALJ) based his findings on the former rule prohibiting sexual contact, even with former patients. Although the ALJ's reference to the invalid rule was stricken by the final order, the psychologist was prejudiced by its use. The ALJ also admitted an incomplete deposition transcript, under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(22), as amended by 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 2, &sect; 1. The reviewing court found Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(22)&nbsp;unconstitutional as an infringement on the Florida Supreme Court's authority conferred by Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(a), as a violation of Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3, and as a denial of due process. The reviewing court certified the issue of the statute's constitutionality to the Florida Supreme Court. Issues of unavailability for purposes of Fla. Stat. ch. 90.804(2)(a) and Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.330(a)(3), and other factors governing the admissibility of the partial deposition were not fully addressed below. If the deposition transcript was admissible hearsay in a civil action, the record was sufficient to prove the violations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The final order was reversed and the matter was remanded, with directions to remand the case to the ALJ for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of cocaine with the intent to sell it. He was released to pretrial services in lieu of bond. Later, defendant was arrested in a second case, and the trial court (Florida) revoked defendant's pretrial release. Defendant filed a motion to reinstate bond, but the trial court denied the motion. Defendant then filed an original petition for writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 903.0471 was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that it was a statutory condition of pretrial release that a defendant refrain from criminal activity of any kind. By the plain words of Fla. Stat. ch. 903.0471, if a defendant was at liberty on pretrial release in case number one, and he committed a new crime, a trial court was allowed to revoke the pretrial release, and refuse any further pretrial release, in case number one.  Fla. Stat. ch. 903.0471 was constitutional as a measure designed to assure the integrity of the judicial process, and thus complied with Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. Where Fla. Stat. ch. 903.0471 was involved, the only finding that needed to be made was the statutory finding that there was probable cause to believe that the defendant committed a new crime while on pretrial release. No showing that a defendant posed a risk of physical harm was required. While the object of bail was to make certain the defendant's appearance in court, the court had the inherent authority to enforce its orders and to require reasonable conduct from those over whom it had jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police benevolent association (PBA) sued appellees, governor and legislature, seeking a judgment declaring that certain actions of the governor and legislature were unconstitutional violations of the right to bargain collectively, and directing the legislature to review and revise the negotiation process for career service employees. The Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) dismissed the complaint. The PBA appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The PBA reached a negotiated wage agreement with the governor, which provided for a wage increase totaling five percent. The legislature, however, provided for a two and one-half percent wage increase. The appellate court held that public bargaining and private bargaining were inherently different because exclusive control over public funds rested solely with the legislature. A wage agreement with a public employer was subject to the necessary public funding which involved the powers, duties, and discretion of the legislature. The legislature was not required to fund a collective bargaining agreement of public employees. Any other rule would permit the executive branch of government, by entering into collective bargaining agreements calling for additional appropriations, to invade the legislative branch's exclusive right to appropriate funds. Where a legislature provided enough money to implement a public employee benefit as negotiated, but attempted to unilaterally change the benefit, the changes were not to be upheld, and the negotiated benefit was to be enforced. That was not alleged in the PBA's complaint, and the trial court correctly dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute upon which defendant was convicted was subsequently declared unconstitutional. The trial court held a hearing to consider whether to resentence defendant or to discharge him, upon mandate from the court of appeals.

The State challenged the same, arguing that defendant should be resentenced for the crime of felon in possession of a firearm, a necessarily lesser-included offense of the now nonexistent crime with which he was originally charged. The defense, however, contended that precedent from the supreme court allowed resentencing only for those crimes on which the jury had been originally instructed. The original record did not contain any instructions for any lesser-included offenses. Thus, the instant court agreed with defendant that the proper remedy was discharge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged the trial court's order against him. The appeals court held that the trial court erred in issuing the writ of attachment because the employer's affidavit was insufficient as a matter of law, under Fla. Stat. ch. 76.08 (2000). The only allegation in the affidavit that arguably met the statutory requirements was that the employer believed that after the employee's arrest the employee asked a sheriff's detective whether his money was still available. This allegation, however, was not based on personal knowledge, but on hearsay apparently contained in a sheriff's report. The employer did not allege any personal knowledge that the employee was removing property from the state, moving out of state, concealing himself, or concealing or disposing of property. In addition, the affidavit relied solely on information and belief as to the ownership of the property it sought to attach. While not dispositive of the case, the appeals court also noted that the trial court compounded its error by not holding an immediate evidentiary hearing on the motion to dissolve the writ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered its order terminating the mother's parental rights to her daughter, on two grounds: that her rights were previously involuntarily terminated in regards to another child, and that she failed to assume parental responsibilities for the child. On appeal, the mother argued that the second ground for termination, the notion of abandonment, was not a statutory ground for termination; thus, she urged that this ground was unconstitutional on its face. The court of appeals disagreed. The mother's chronic neglect, incapacity to parent and pattern of abandonment were manifest. Allowing for termination of her rights without regard to extraneous circumstances, did not deprive her of a fundamental liberty interests in determining the care and upbringing of her child. It was clear the mother's unbroken pattern of failure and her unwillingness and incapacity to parent caused the termination of her rights. Such an order was the least restrictive means of protecting the child from harm and reunification posed a substantial risk of serious harm to the child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held defendant presented a claim which should not have been summarily denied.

The trial court rejected this claim because it was unsupported by any affidavit or corroboration, did not name either the juror or bailiff, and was not otherwise substantiated by the record. The appellate court held that such corroboration was not necessary.

It was unknown whether the jurors followed their instructions and presumed defendant to be impaired or whether they determined that from the evidence. Since one of the ways to prove the offense was legally inadequate, defendant's conviction had to be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. Defendant's conviction possibly based on one invalid legal alternative could not be sustained merely because of overwhelming evidence, on the valid ground.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court for Brevard County (Florida) of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer and was sentenced. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court used a 1.5 multiplier on defendant's scoresheet pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0024(1)(6) (1999). The appellate court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 784.07(2)(c) reclassified an aggravated assault from a third to a second-degree felony when the assault was on law enforcement officers and certain other officials. Similarly, Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0024(1)(b) created a multiplier of 1.5 if the primary offense was a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 775.0823(10).  Fla. Stat. ch. 784.07 was enacted to increase the penalties for the enumerated crimes, and it was an enhancement statute. Double enhancements were only allowed if two different harms were addressed by each enhancement. Defendant was entitled to relief since his scoresheet was enhanced twice: first when his crime was reclassified from a third to second degree felony and second when the 1.5 multiplier was applied under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0024 for a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 784.021. Since both enhancements arose because the victim was a law enforcement officer, they constituted an impermissible double enhancement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found that the trial court correctly concluded Fla. Stat. ch. 448.01 did not apply to the employees because they were hourly employees and not employed by the day, week, month, or year. The appellate court also found that, in the absence of language in an employee manual expressly providing that the manual constituted a separate employment agreement, or the parties' explicit mutual agreement to that effect, policy statements in an employment manual did not constitute the terms of a contract of employment. The employees could not base their claim for overtime payments on statements in an employment manual. The evidence fell short of establishing, as a matter of law, that a binding contract existed between the parties, and hence, the trial court erred in not granting the employer's motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court, Palm Beach County (Florida), of possession of cocaine, and sentenced to the maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment, in spite of a pre-sentence investigation recommendation of probation. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, charged with trafficking in cocaine, was convicted of the lesser-included offense of possession. The trial court imposed the maximum sentence, finding the amount of narcotics and cash possessed by defendant made the crime &quot;not merely a street level issue.&quot; The appellate court held Fla. Stat. chs. 921.002(1)(g) (2000); 921.0024(2) (2000); 924.06(1)(d), (e) (2000); and Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(b)(1)(D) did not foreclose defendant's right to appellate review of his claim of violation of due process during sentencing, even though the sentence imposed was within statutory limits. While due process prohibited the trial court's consideration of conduct of which defendant was acquitted in imposing sentence, it did not prohibit the consideration of all relevant factors when imposing a sentence authorized for his crime. The trial court's finding that defendant possessed a substantial amount of narcotics was not a determination of an element of an offense contrary to the jury verdict, but a consideration of a traditional sentencing factor, which did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

The trial court resentenced him to life in prison and classified him as a habitual violent felony offender pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084(4)(B)M. The trial court's authority for imposing a habitual violent felony offender sentence was Fla. Stat. ch. 95-182, the same chapter that the Florida Supreme Court declared unconstitutional in Thompson.

Thus, the trial court's prior decision did not establish the law of the case.

Stat. ch. 627.411, in its entirety, unconstitutional because it delegated legislative authority to appellant Florida Department of Insurance (DOI). Appellant state treasurer and the DOI sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 627.411(1)(e) (1997), called the &quot;viability provision,&quot; covered rating practices which resulted in premium escalations that were not viable for the policyholder market. At the time declaratory judgment was sought, one insurer had no rate increase request pending before the DOI and had never had a filing denied on the basis of ch. 627.411(1)(e), or any rate filings reviewed under that provision. The other insurer had had a previous filing denied partially on the basis of that provision, but the issue had been settled by consent order and was no longer pending. The appellate court found that the insurers' only allegations of a present controversy were that they were required to submit rate changes to DOI for review; that DOI, at some undetermined time concerning an undetermined submission, might disapprove rates or forms based on the viability provision; and that their filings would continue to be subject to disapproval under the viability provision unless the language was declared unconstitutional. Neither insurer had an actual, present dispute concerning rate filings involving the provision. Thus, the judgment was an impermissible advisory opinion.</SPAN></P>

If the victim injury points were assessed, defendant was not entitled to resentencing. However, before victim injury points could be assessed, the trial court had to hold an evidentiary hearing regarding facts which supported the extent and nature of the victim injury. No evidentiary hearing was ever held regarding victim injury before the points were assessed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed on the issue of imposing victim injury points and affirmed on all other issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that the city's pawnshop fees were a tax, because the fees primarily benefitted the general public, as they were expended on the city police services, and that they were involuntary in that, if the pawnshop operator failed to pay the fees, that operator's license would be revoked. The appellate court held that the trial court's conclusions were not correct because: (1) the benefit received by the general public was conferred by the Florida Pawnbroking Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch.  Fla. Stat. ch. 539.001- 539.003 (1997) and by the Act's requirements placed on pawnshops. The benefits from the fee payments went to the pawnshop owners, who were enabled to perform their Act-required duties, as the fees supported the police detail that administered the shops' transaction reports and performed other tasks caused by the pawnshops' required actions under the Act; and (2) the city's pawnshop fees were voluntary, because they benefitted the pawnshop operators in a manner not shared by other members of society, as they were paid by choice, in that the operators paying the fee had the option of not utilizing the governmental service and thereby avoiding the charge.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that defendant's 25-year minimum prison sentence for discharging a firearm, killing one person and seriously injuring another, did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment. Defendant's substantive due process claim also failed, because Fla. Stat. ch. 775.087(2) bore a reasonable relationship to the permissive legislative objective and was not discriminatory, arbitrary, or oppressive. As defendant did not identify which terms within the statute required further illumination so that a person of ordinary intelligence would understand them, his void for vagueness challenge failed.</SPAN></P>

The statute applied only to prisoners who were adjudicated indigent and required that their civil claims and appeals be prescreened for a determination of whether the claim was legally sufficient to state a cause of action. The appellate court found that, in ruling on defendant's petition, the trial court committed two errors. The trial court committed procedural error in determining that defendant was not adjudicated indigent. Defendant submitted an affidavit of indigency in which he listed, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 57.085(7), only one prior adjudication of indigency. If his sworn affidavit of indigency was correct, the trial court erred by denying indigency status. If his recitals were incorrect, the statute did not automatically foreclose an adjudication of indigency. The trial court should not have prescreened the claim of a prisoner who was not adjudicated indigent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information with delivery of cocaine. He was found incompetent to proceed to trial. Thereafter, there was no indication in the record that the trial court held a competency hearing and determined he was competent to proceed. Nevertheless, the case proceeded to a jury trial, which the State conceded was error. At trial, defendant unsuccessfully raised an entrapment defense. He testified in his defense that an officer approached him looking for crack cocaine and pulled out a 20-dollar bill. He testified he only agreed to get her the cocaine after she agreed to share it with him. He testified that he was a cocaine addict and had five previous felony convictions, one of which was for possession of cocaine. The appellate court held that, as the facts could be interpreted as either proof of inducement or of predisposition to deliver the cocaine, the trial court did not err when it decided to submit the issue of entrapment to the jury. Defendant failed to demonstrate subjective entrapment as a matter of law. There was no evidence adduced that would support the contention that law enforcement knew defendant was either mentally ill or a cocaine addict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate challenged the judgment against it.

It filed a motion to tax costs based on the court's entering final judgment in its favor with regard to the issues on enforcement of the structured settlement agreement. Included in the motion were expert witness fees it incurred. The court of appeals found the statute unconstitutional and agreed with the insurer, based upon its interpretation of Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(4)(a). Further, it noted the legislature requested that the requirements be adopted by supreme court rule in the event that any court of competent jurisdiction was to find the provision unconstitutional, as the instant court did. Thus, the holding gave the supreme court jurisdiction to review the decision and consider such request, per Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 3(b)(1) .</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the victim voluntarily let defendant in her home, he stabbed her to death and stole her property. The appellate court held that the supreme court's interpretation of the burglary statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 810.02(1) (1993) -- that a victim's consent allowing defendant in her home was only withdrawn if he remained there surreptitiously -- was the law, in spite of legislation expressing the intention to nullify this interpretation, because the only body which could recede from this interpretation was the supreme court, which had not yet considered the matter. Given the absence of proof of defendant's surreptitiously remaining on the premises, the victim's consent was not withdrawn, and reversal of defendant's burglary conviction was required. The fact that, of 17 DNA samples taken from the crime scene, one of them was from a person other than defendant or the victim, did not fail to exclude every reasonable hypothesis of defendant's innocence, because there were plausible explanations of how that could have occurred unrelated to the commission of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 14 when he murdered the victim. He was tried as an adult. The appellate court held a per se constitutional violation under U.S. Const. amend. VIII did not occur because defendant's sentence was both mandatory and severe, as the sentence was not unusual. Applying the five principles encompassed in the proportionality rule, defendant's sentence did not violate the rule because the legislature's determination of the penalty, as applied to defendant, was a rational conclusion regarding an appropriate prison term for first degree murder; nor was it grossly disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment. Defendant's age had to be considered in a proportionality review, but his conduct and the ultimate harm inflicted on his victim outweighed it. Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, required a determination of whether defendant's sentence was cruel and whether it was unusual.  Fla. Stat. ch. 985.221(1)(a) (1997) expressed the legislature's intent to impose life imprisonment without parole whether an offender was an adult or a child, and, given the same punishment for less serious crimes, it was not cruel. Such sentences were not uncommon in Florida, and were not, thus, unusual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insured sued appellant insurance company in the County Court for Volusia County, Florida, to compel it to pay for medical services rendered by the insured's physician. The trial court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(5)(b) (1999) was unconstitutional and ordered the insurer to pay the charges. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was involved in an automobile accident and sought treatment from his physician. The physician submitted statements for his medical services to the insurer more than 30 days after the services were rendered. The insurer denied coverage because the statements were statutorily delinquent. The insured sued the insurer. The trial court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(5)(b) (1999) was unconstitutional as violative of the physician's rights to equal protection, due process, and access to the courts. The appellate court initially noted that an equal protection challenge to a statute that did not involve a fundamental right or suspect classification was evaluated by the rational basis test. The appellate court held that ch. 627.736(5)(b) sought to remedy the absence of a notice requirement by requiring timely statements from medical providers so that an insurer would be aware of treatment and in a better position to assure that the treatment was reasonable, related to a claimed injury, or necessary. The appellate court concluded that the statute bore a reasonable relationship to a legitimate legislative objective and was not discriminatory, arbitrary, or oppressive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended there was a fundamental error in the jury instructions. The jury was told that one element to be established was that defendant &quot;uttered or issued or delivered&quot; the worthless checks. Defendant argued that the jury should have been given a definition of the word &quot;uttered.&quot; Defendant did not make a request for such an instruction in the trial court. The appellate court concluded that there was no fundamental error as the other words used in the instruction were synonymous with &quot;uttered.&quot; Whether it was plausible to believe that defendant did not know the financial position of the corporation was a question for jury determination. The appellate court was not convinced that there was a misnomer of the name of victim travel agency and if there was, there was no prejudice to defendant. If the statutory demand letter was properly sent and the maker of the check failed to pay within the time limit, then the State had the benefit of the evidence-of-intent provision of Fla. Stat. ch. 832.07(1)(a) (1995). There was no authority requiring a second statutory notification where the initial information was nolle prossed, and the case was refiled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County, Florida, convicted defendant of burglary. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court reversibly erred in denying a Frye hearing concerning DNA evidence that was alleged to have not met the Frye test. The appellate court held that defendant correctly argued that an inquiry into the reliability of the DNA testing for purposes of admissibility was necessary because defendant made a timely request for a Frye hearing, supported by authorities indicating that there may not have been general acceptance in the scientific community of the DNA testing technique employed. Because the trial court did not hold a Frye hearing, defendant had not been given the opportunity to challenge the DNA testing methods. That failure to give defendant an opportunity to present conflicting evidence constituted a violation of his due process rights. Thus, the trial court erred in admitting the DNA evidence without holding a Frye hearing. Further, the error was not harmless; an eyewitness's identification of defendant during the burglary of the dwelling was questionable, as he could only see the outline of defendant opening a refrigerator and could not describe any facial features.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded no contest in the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida) to trafficking in 14 or more but less than 28 grams of methamphetamine, violating Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(f)(1)(a) (1999). She was sentenced to 40 months' imprisonment and appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute criminalizing defendant's conduct, Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135, was amended to provide a minimum mandatory sentence. The amendment was part of a legislative act, 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188, containing numerous provisions, most of which were logically connected to the concern stated in its preamble that offenders were not being sentenced to the maximum terms allowed by law. To avoid violating Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, the single subject rule, the act had to embrace one subject and matter connected therewith, which subject was to be briefly expressed in its title. The appellate court found &sect; 13 of the act amended the definition of &quot;conveyance&quot; for purposes of the burglary statute. Section 11 required court clerks to provide documents concerning aliens to immigration officers. These sections had nothing to do with sentencing, and their inclusion in 1999 Fla. Laws ch. 188 rendered the entire act unconstitutional. Defendant's time within which to raise this infirmity closed on the effective date of the reenactment of the statute, normally done every two years. However, the bill to reenact the 1999 statutes was never passed, so the time to challenge the act had not closed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was reversed, and the matter was remanded. Two questions of great public importance were certified to the supreme court concerning whether the act violated the single subject rule and whether the period within which to challenge this infirmity had closed.</SPAN></P>

The police did not illegally enter defendant's home, they entered the home of another. Although defendant was invited to a party at the home, this alone did not give him standing to contest the illegality of the police entry. The officer was not attempting to arrest defendant, he patted him down and instructed him to sit down while other officers investigated. Even if the pat down and detention were technically illegal, they were less of an intrusion than an arrest, so defendant was not justified in using force to resist. Once defendant put the officer in a headlock, the officer had probable cause to arrest him. Defendant's subsequent actions were sufficient to sustain the conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee father was made the primary residential custodian of the parties' children in a divorce action, appellant mother filed a petition to give her sole parental responsibility for the children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that there was competent, substantial evidence supporting the findings made by the trial court. The trial court properly allowed the grandmother to intervene. The grandmother had actual physical custody of the children for many years, with the mother's knowledge, and was a natural grandparent of the children. She had an interest in the proceeding and was properly allowed to participate. It was also appropriate for the trial court to maintain the status quo of the grandmother's custody of the children pending trial so that it could receive evidence and exercise its continuing jurisdiction over the welfare of the children. The trial court concluded that the best interests of the children would be met if a change in residential custody was not ordered and that a change in custody to mother would, in fact, be detrimental to the children. The appellate court found that the conclusions of the trial court were supported by the evidence, and the proper legal standards were applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was being legally detained as a result of a judicial determination, made pursuant to the Florida Involuntary Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act, that he was a sexually violent predator. The inmate claimed that he was denied due process and was entitled to immediate release because he was not mentally examined as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 394.918(1) (1999); he was not timely provided with written notice of his right to petition the committing court for release as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 394.918(2); and the committing court did not conduct the limited probable cause hearing as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 394.918(3). The appellate court found that the writ of habeas corpus had to be denied because under the statute the inmate could not be released until the committing court had reviewed his mental condition following an examination. A writ of mandamus was not required to order the department to provide the inmate with the required statutory notice because the department had corrected that error. However, a writ of mandamus was proper to cause the department to compel the department to provide the required statutory mental examination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied. The petition for writ of mandamus was denied in part because the department remedied its failure to provide defendant with the required notice and waiver of rights form. The petition for writ of mandamus was granted in part because the required mental examination of the inmate had not been performed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV) appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Orange County, Florida, which was entered in favor of appellee driver on the ground that he was not legally barred from applying for a hardship driver's license despite four convictions for driving under the influence (DUI).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver received his fourth DUI conviction and his driver's license was permanently revoked. At the time of sentencing, the driver was informed that he would be eligible for a hardship license after five years. When the driver applied for his license 12 years later, he was told that he was no longer eligible due to change in the law. The DHSMV argued that 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 98-223, &sect; 8, did not violate the single subject rule of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, because 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 98-223, &sect; 2, partially unencumbered the privilege to drive, by providing an alternative to automatic license suspension upon prosecution for a worthless check. The appellate court held rejected this argument holding that 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 98-223, &sect; 2, lacked a logical or natural connection to driver's licenses, registrations, or operation of motor vehicles but that it related to the collection of debts evidenced by bad checks by private debt collectors and recovery of reasonable collection fees incurred by such private debt collectors. Nothing in 1998 Fla. Laws ch. 98-223, &sect; 2, referred to driver's licenses or to the suspension thereof or to the operation of motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 775.082 (1995) identified the range of penalties applicable to every degree of offense in Florida from a capital felony to a second-degree misdemeanor, and expressly set forth the maximum penalty for every degree of offense. Florida's sentencing guidelines were developed to establish a uniform set of standards to guide the sentencing judge in the sentence decisionmaking process. Defendant's maximum guidelines score for the three second-degree felonies, 230 months, resulted in a possible sentence of as many as 50 prison months above the 15-year statutory maximum for one second-degree felony, 180 months. Defendant was sentenced to 184 months for each of the three offenses, to be served concurrently. Using a 1994 Florida Sentencing Guidelines Worksheet, defendant's maximum potential sentence was 166 months. In Florida, for purposes of determining a constitutional violation under Apprendi, the relevant statutory maximum was found in Fl. Stat. ch. 775.082.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's father was charged with sexual molesting. The child was adjudicated to be dependent. The trial court granted the mother's request for permission to move to another state with the child. The agency sought relief from that order because the state the mother planned to move to had not agreed to provide supervision of the child. Article III of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, Fla. Stat. ch. 409.401 (2000) (ICPC), which prescribed conditions to be satisfied before a child could be placed in another state, did not apply to the mother's decision to move to another state with the child.  Fla. Stat. ch. 409.401, art. VIII (2000) exempted the mother's proposed relocation from the requirements of ch. 409.401, art. III. Any contrary provision of regulations promulgated by the Association of Administrators of the Interstate Compact was of no effect, and those regulations did not, by their own terms, apply to the mother's relocation, since she had full authority to plan for the child. The agency was required to provide continued supervision of the child, in whatever manner it found appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion for a new trial, defendant had argued two witnesses used to convict him had recanted their testimony, his trial counsel was ineffective, and that he was inappropriately sentenced. The appellate court initially noted a question of whether recantation testimony was credible was a preliminary issue for the trial court and declined to reverse the trial court. Moreover, the appellate court held defendant was not automatically entitled to a new trial once a trial witness filed a recantation affidavit. The appellate court dispensed with defendant's ineffective assistance claim as unmeritorious and without discussion. However, the appellate court found merit in defendant's sentencing argument because the addition of a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence amounted to an impermissible increase in his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a new trial and rejection of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were affirmed; however, defendant's sentence was reversed and remanded for correction of the sentencing order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile objected to giving a blood sample for the purpose of DNA testing and filed a motion to declare Fla. Stat. ch. 943.325&nbsp;unconstitutional as applied to the offense of burglary. Specifically, she argued the statute violated the constitutional guarantees of the United States under the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments, and the state constitution. The trial court denied the motion, holding there was a rational basis for the legislature's addition of burglary to Fla. Stat. ch. 943.325 and that the juvenile's expectation of equal protection under the constitution had not been disappointed. The appellate court initially noted Fla. Stat. ch. 943.325(1) required any person convicted of an enumerated offense who was incarcerated or under court-ordered supervision to submit blood samples for DNA analysis. The appellate court held a convicted person, as defined in Fla. Stat. ch. 943.325, had no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to DNA testing that outweighed the State's interests in identifying convicted felons in a manner that could not be circumvented, in apprehending criminals, in preventing recidivism, and in absolving innocent persons charged with crimes.</SPAN></P>

Stat. chs. 800.03, 877.03, unconstitutional. The litigants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigants complained that a county ordinance violated the equal protection guarantee of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, to the extent it prohibited exposure of the female breast in circumstances where the exposure of the male breast was allowed. They argued that the addition of &quot;female and male alike&quot; language required strict scrutiny of laws that discriminated between women and men. Such was contradicted by the commentary of the constitution revision commission. The initial proposal would have added the term &quot;sex&quot; to the list of protected classes, but some members objected that such an amendment could lead Florida courts to conclude that it required recognition of same-sex marriages. Accordingly, the commission added the &quot;female and male alike&quot; terms to secure equality for women. Based on this different treatment of sex on the one hand from national origin and physical disability on the other, classifications based on sex were not subject to strict scrutiny.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had used a 1995 sentencing guidelines scoresheet in imposing defendant's sentence. The trial court offered two reasons for departure which included one under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0016(n) (1995), which allowed the court to depart where the offense was committed by means of concealment, guile, or fraud to obtain money, the offense involved a high degree of sophistication, defendant used position or status to facilitate commission of the offense, and defendant had been involved in similar conduct in the past. The appellate court held that although the trial court offered in addition to this valid reason, one invalid reason for departure, that erroneous reason did not invalidate the departure. However, because the trial court sentenced defendant using the 1995 guidelines which had become unconstitutional, remand was required for a recalculation of defendant's departure sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation contended that the Fla. Stat. ch. 626.989(6) (2000), which it was charged with violating, was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied. As a viatical settlement provider, the corporation purchased life insurance policies from viators at a discount of the policies' death benefits and sold the policies to investors at a price between the discounted price paid by the corporation and the death benefits under the policy. The insurance department alleged that the corporation knew or should have known that the life insurance policies sold by the viators were obtained unethically as a result of a misrepresentation as to the state of the health of the viator. The appellate court held that the corporation's conduct fell well within the ambit of Fla. Stat. ch. 626.989(6), where it had suggested to the viators in writing that they do not contact their insurers or report the sale of the policies during the contestable period, and also paid the viators' premiums in the interim. Thus, there was no need for the appellate court to address the possible applications of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Fla.

Because defendant was convicted of false imprisonment, one of the enumerated offenses in the definition of sexual offender, he was required to register. Where defendant was convicted of false imprisonment under Fla. Stat. ch. 787.02(1)(a) and/or (b), and it was clear that the predicate crime was totally devoid of a sexual component, a rational basis was lost. Including an offender convicted of false imprisonment in the definition of &quot;sexual offender,&quot; without a concomitant sexual component, rendered the sexual offender registration statute overinclusive.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the State's proof of his prior traffic convictions for driving while license suspended failed as a matter of law. He argued that the State was required to prove each of the qualifying convictions separately and with all the formalities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant special improvement district sued appellee property appraiser and tax collector over the denial of a tax exemption. The Circuit Court for Highlands County, Florida, granted summary to the appraiser and tax collector. The district appealed; appellant executive director of the Department of Revenue joined in the appeal as it related to the trial court's ruling that Fla. Stat. ch. 189.403(1) (1997) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district tax issued tax exempt capital improvement bonds to fund infrastructure; the bonds were secured by assessments on property in the district. However, the main developer went bankrupt, and the district had to foreclose on its lots. The district reached an agreement with a developer and the bondholders regarding the sales of lots. A key part of the agreement was thwarted when the appraiser denied the district's request for an exemption from ad valorem taxes on the lots. The trial court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 196.199(1)(c), which gave special districts the same right as municipalities for exemption from ad valorem taxes, was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that this ruling was error; the appraiser, as a government officer, was obliged to presume that legislation affecting his duties was valid, and lacked standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality. However, the district could not claim an exemption for the property marketed for private sale, as this was not an exclusively public purpose. Remand was required to determine whether recreational facilities maintained by the district could serve an exclusively public purpose and thus be exempt from tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That part of the judgment that held the statute unconstitutional was reversed. That part of the judgment that held that the lots marketed for sale to private persons were subject to ad valorem taxes was affirmed. As to the golf course, tennis courts, restaurant, and pro shop, the case was remanded for a determination whether these properties were held exclusively for a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because the Florida Supreme Court found Fla. Laws ch. 95- 184 to be unconstitutional and because &sect; 26 of that chapter contained provisions related to gain time, it followed that he was entitled to have his gain time calculated on the pre-1995 version of the gain time statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 944.275 (1993). Defendant was not entitled to relief, however, because the amendments to ch. 944.275 contained within Fla. Laws ch. 95-184 were editorial in nature and did not affect the amount of gain time to which inmates were entitled. The amendment from which defendant sought relief was actually enacted within Fla. Laws ch. 95-294, &sect; 2, at Fla. Laws ch. 2717. This amendment imposed the rule that inmates had to serve at least 85 percent their sentences. Unlike Fla. Laws ch. 95-184, Fla. Laws ch. 95-294 had not been declared unconstitutional. Moreover, any claim that defendant was entitled to additional gain time based on case law was not cognizable should have been raised administratively before the Department of Corrections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former director of appellee corporation challenged judgment against her. The trial court dismissed counts of her petition with prejudice finding that (1) she did not have standing to bring the action on behalf of herself or any member of the corporation; (2) she failed to state a derivative cause of action against any of the directors individually; and (3) the petition failed to allege ultimate facts upon which she, individually, could state a cause of action against any of the named directors. The appeals court held that dismissal of counts III through XII for failure to state a cause of action was proper. While the trial court incorrectly decided that the former director lacked standing to bring a derivative action against the directors, it was correct in concluding that, in any event, her counts did not and could not state derivative causes of action against the directors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this Jimmy Ryce appeal, the decisive issue was whether extensive hearsay evidence which was permitted to go to the jury deprived patient of a fair trial guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions. The appeals court agreed that it did. Permitting police reports containing unsworn allegations of serious sexual misconduct into evidence without providing any opportunity to confront the witnesses was error. Therefore, in many of the instances in which out-of-court witness were permitted to testify through the mouths of police officers, there was no opportunity to challenge their extremely prejudicial testimony. Because committal, to a large extent, was based on testimony of out-of-court witnesses, which lacked the indicia of reliability, the patient was denied his right to confront his accusers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a separate lawsuit involving different plaintiffs, the county was temporarily enjoined from issuing certain permits for development in a study area that contained the partnership's land. The injunction was to remain in effect until the county implemented a comprehensive stormwater plan for the study area. Pursuant to a settlement with the plaintiffs, the county agreed not to appeal the injunction order. To comply with the injunction, the county implemented an ordinance imposing a temporary moratorium on development in the study area. The partnership alleged that the county's actions deprived it of all reasonable economic use of its property. The trial court held that the partnership's claim was not ripe because it never tested the injunction or obtained a final authoritative decision regarding the extent of the regulation on the use of its property. The appellate court agreed. Further, the temporary moratorium on development was not a taking. While the county's imposition of a moratorium may have burdened or inconvenienced the partnership, it did completely deprive the partnership of all economically beneficial use of its property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Heggs ruled that 1995 Fla. Laws ch. 184 was unconstitutional for violating the single subject rule. Thus, defendant's primary offense of attempted armed robbery with a firearm should have been scored in accordance with Fla. Stat. ch. 777.04 (1993). It appeared that the 1994 sentencing guidelines allowed a sentence of 26.1 to 43.5 months. Defendant entered a plea to the original charges in 1997. In 2000, he pleaded to a violation of probation and was sentenced to 60 months under the 1995 sentencing guidelines. Defendant claimed that he pleaded specifically because his sentence would be a certain percentage of the maximum under the 1995 sentencing guidelines. He now claimed that his plea was involuntary following the decision in Heggs, and he sought to withdraw his plea or to be resentenced. Defendant made a facially sufficient claim which the trial court did not refute. Defendant's sentence of 60 months could not have been imposed, absent a departure, under the 1994 sentencing guidelines. If his plea was not negotiated, he was entitled to be resentenced. If the plea was negotiated, he had to be given the opportunity to withdraw his plea.</SPAN></P>

Each defendant produced a fake or altered INS card to the officer as a form of identification. Defendants challenged their convictions by arguing that ch. 322.212(1)(c) did not apply to INS cards, and was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. The appellate court rejected these arguments. By its plain language, the statute encompassed identification cards issued by any jurisdiction that issued identification cards recognized in Florida. INS cards, which were issued by the United States, a &quot;jurisdiction,&quot; were recognized in Florida as a sufficient form of identification to prove identity when applying for a driver's license or a Florida identification card. They contained the holder's photograph, name, date of birth, and a fingerprint. The statute was sufficiently certain upon its face that it was unnecessary for the appellate court to invoke the rules of statutory construction. Further, it was not unconstitutionally vague; it contained no ambiguous terms, nor was a plain reading of it difficult or unclear.</SPAN></P>

The department alleged that the arbitrators based their decision solely on hearsay, and exceeded their powers. The department attempted to recast allegedly erroneous evidentiary rulings and fact findings as alleged malfeasance of a kind that would justify vacating the arbitrators' award. The cases categorically rejected this approach. There was no authority for vacating the arbitrators' award because the arbitrators considered evidence, even evidence that would be inadmissible in a judicial or administrative proceeding. Finally, the department failed to state grounds for vacating the arbitration award as it lacked allegations that no good or sufficient cause was shown for scheduling and conducting the hearing more than 60 days after the demand for arbitration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed a store and tied up victims. His motion to strike a sleeping juror was granted the next day, when his counsel waived his presence. He did not argue to the trial court a lack of opportunity to ratify his attorney's waiver, so the issue was not considered. He was not harmed by the delay in granting his motion. The jurors' request to be referred to by number, rather than name, for fear of retribution, did not entitle defendant to a jury interview. The store manager's description of defendant, right after the manager's perception, was non-hearsay identification under Fla. Stat. ch. 90.801(2)(c) (1999). Improper references to defendant's race did not require a mistrial. Defendant gave samples of his DNA but asked that they only be provided to the State's attorney and the police, and the trial court so ordered. They were not inadmissible because given to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Defendant's binding of his victims (a) was not slight, inconsequential, or merely incidental to the robbery; (b) was not inherent in the robbery; and (c) had significance independent of the robbery in that it lessened the detection risk, so it was chargeable as a separate crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court erred when it denied defendant's motion for mistrial based on the State's introduction of evidence concerning a crime for which he had previously been acquitted. A police officer testified he chased defendant on foot from the scene of the cocaine seizure and defendant swung a gate at the officer, knocking him down. Defense counsel immediately moved for mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor introduced the factual basis of the crime of battery on a law enforcement officer, a charge on which defendant had been acquitted in the first trial. The prosecutor argued that she was entitled to use the evidence to prove defendant's consciousness of guilt on the possession charge. The introduction of evidence that he swung the gate into the pursuing officer was barred by the principle of collateral estoppel. It was inconsistent with the notions of a fair trial for the State to force a defendant to resurrect a prior defense against a crime for which he was not on trial. The officer was collaterally estopped to testify that defendant swung the gate into him. Introduction of this evidence constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction for possession of cocaine and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence in the Circuit Court for Dade County, Florida, of armed burglary, two counts of armed robbery, five counts of armed kidnapping, aggravated battery, simple battery, and improper exhibition of a firearm, and the trial court's order denying defendant's motion to correct sentence filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.800(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had originally been sentenced under the 1995 guidelines to concurrent life sentences and a concurrent 15-year sentence. While defendant's appeal was pending, defendant filed his motion correct sentence in the trial court. The trial court held a hearing and, while resentencing defendant under the 1994 guidelines, imposed a departure sentence on defendant as a habitual violent felony offender based upon a Canadian conviction for sexual assault that the State had known about at the first sentencing but did not present to the court until the second sentencing. The trial court's order was not entered until after 60 days from when defendant had filed the motion. The appellate court first held that, because the trial court had not ruled on the motion to correct sentence within 60 days, the order was a nullity and defendant could challenge the sentences on direct appeal. Defendant was entitled to be resentenced under Heggs but could not be sentenced as a violent habitual felony offender because the Canadian offense was broader than the parallel Florida offense of sexual battery. The trial court could still impose a departure sentence if it found it to be appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed but the sentence was vacated and the case remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held that the Florida Sexual Predators Act, Fla.

Although the offenses had involved a baby girl that was not defendant's child, defendant had neither committed any sexual act on or in the presence of the child. Under such circumstances, the statute was unconstitutionally overinclusive and did not pass the rationale relationship test. Declaring defendant a sexual predator where there was no sexual element to his crime would lead to an absurd result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Florida's offer of judgment statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79, could be utilized for attorney fees in a case arising from negligent tax advice given by the firm in Tennessee but litigated in Florida under Tennessee substantive law. The appellate court rejected the auctioneer's argument that the firm was estopped from changing its position that Tennessee law applied and seeking attorney fees under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79. Both parties made offers of judgment pursuant to the statute and, at different times in the litigation, each party changed its position on the applicability of it. Neither side was prejudiced by the other's change of position, which involved only a question of law. The appellate court concluded that, because the statute was clear, it should be applied without engaging in a conflict of laws analysis. When the Florida Legislature enacted Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79, it was making a policy determination that attorney's fees should be recoverable under certain circumstances. The appellate court's conclusion that Fla. Stat. ch. 768.79 applied to all civil actions for damages brought in Florida courts was consistent with the legislative intent of reducing litigation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed and remanded for the trial court to award attorney fees to the accounting firm.</SPAN></P>

The city declared a nuisance and directed the buyer to remove it. When the buyer failed to do so, the city had it removed and, pursuant to Panama City, Fla., Mun. Code &sect; 18-3, imposed a lien on the property for the cost of removal. The ordinance required notice of the nuisance and assessment to the owner/occupant of the land and a mortgagee if the nuisance involved a structure but only to the landowner/occupant of the property if it did not. The trial court found the that the ordinance violated the equal protection clauses of both the state and federal constitutions because there was no rational basis for treating mortgagees differently and that therefore the city had not given the mortgagee proper notice. The appellate court held that the ordinance was not facially unconstitutional as the division of mortgagees into classes for notice purposes did serve a legitimate governmental interest and the lien did not amount to an outright taking of the property.

However, there was simply no chance that the erroneous instruction contributed to the verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court found that the State made no effort to secure the attendance of the witness at the trial and made no effort to demonstrate that the witness was unavailable.

Stat. ch. 90.803(22) removed the requirement that the witness be unavailable. Although this authorized the admission of the witness's testimony from the prior trial, the appellate court found that defendant's constitutional right to confront and cross-examine his accuser was violated; hence, the appellate court held that ch. 90.803(22) was unconstitutional in criminal cases.</SPAN></P>

Where there has been no judicial action nor any prejudice to the State, an appellate court saw no good reason for inflexible adherence to a two year limit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Polk County, Florida, initially denied defendant's motion to dismiss his information and later convicted him for resisting an officer without violence, three counts of forgery, and three counts of uttering a forged instrument. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All of defendant's offenses were alleged to have occurred on December 6, 1996. The forgery and uttering forged instrument charges were based upon defendant signing the name of his brother on three traffic tickets. The State did not file an information on these charges until May 10, 2000. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information, alleging that it violated the statute of limitations because it was filed more than three years after the date of the offenses. The State successfully responded that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.15(3)(a) (1995) provided that the statute of limitations could be extended for three years when the offenses were based on fraud and when the prosecution was commenced within one year after the fraud was discovered by the aggrieved party, namely, defendant's brother. The appellate court initially noted that the State offered no evidence, other than the prosecutor's unsworn statements, that would establish the date the offense was discovered by defendant's brother. The appellate court held that the State failed to meet its burden of establishing that it filed the information within a year from the date of that discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and remanded with instructions to the trial court to dismiss the information, vacate defendant's convictions and sentences, and to discharge him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife, as personal representative of decedent's estate, sued the pawn shop for wrongful death as well as a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.17 (1997), which made it a crime to sell a weapon to a person of unsound mind. The Circuit Court for the 19th Judicial Circuit, Okeechobee County, Florida, entered summary judgment in favor of the pawn shop. The wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This action arose from the sale of a handgun by the pawn shop to the shooter, who was mentally retarded. The shooter used the gun days later in a robbery attempt, killing the decedent. The wife claimed that at all times relevant the shooter was of unsound mind and mentally incompetent.  Fla. Stat. ch.790.17 (1997) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied. Moreover, the pawn shop lacked standing to raise a facial vagueness challenge. Under the facts of this case, the shooter fell squarely within the definition of a person of &quot;unsound mind.&quot; Since grade school, the shooter had been diagnosed as mentally and emotionally retarded. He always lived with his parents or his grandmother, he never held a job, he received disability benefits from social security, he could not drive, and he did not know how to handle money or balance a checkbook. While the trial court adopted the pawn shop's expert's opinion that the shooter was only mildly retarded, the testimony of the shooter's mother and physician demonstrated otherwise.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 775.087(1)(a) (1991) required enhancement of a felony offense to a life felony when the defendant carried, displayed, used, threatened, or attempted to use a weapon or firearm during the commission of the felony. Due to an anomaly in the sentencing laws at the time the offense was committed, a life felony was punishable by either a life sentence of a term of years not exceeding 40. The appellate court agreed with defendant and held that the sentence was illegal as it exceeded 40 years. The case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It appeared from the appellate record that the sentencing court found defendant to be an habitual offender, but did not impose an habitual offender sentence.

If he was, he was not entitled to relief under a prior decision finding the 1995 sentencing guidelines unconstitutional, as that decision only applied to guidelines sentences and not to habitual offender sentences. If he was sentenced under the unconstitutional guidelines, he had a valid claim for resentencing. If defendant was sentenced both as a habitual offender and under the unconstitutional sentencing guidelines, he was entitled to resentencing because the trial court could not lawfully impose both sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued the trial court incorrectly calculated his sentence under the 1994 sentencing guidelines by scoring the offense of sexual activity with a child in familial or custodial relationship as a level 9 offense. Specifically, he argued he was entitled to resentencing in light of the unconstitutional 1995 sentencing guidelines because his sentence would have been a departure under the 1994 sentencing guidelines. The appellate court held under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.0013(3) (1993), a first-degree felony not listed in the ranking chart was required to be ranked as a level 7 offense, and that the crime of sexual activity with a child in familial or custodial relationship under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(8)(b) was not listed in the ranking chart. The appellate court concluded if defendant's sentence had been scored as a level 7 offense it would have resulted in a sentence ranging from 40.5 to 67.5 months, instead of the 109 months he received; thus, he was entitled to resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 836.11(1) on the grounds that the statute was facially unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wrote anonymous letters to the board of county commissioners which contained anti-semitic comments. Defendant was charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 836.11 which made it unlawful to expose any individual or religious group to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy through the use of any printed material. The appellate court agreed with the trial court's finding that the statute was facially unconstitutional in violation of the First Amendment. The statute was not content-neutral as it criminalized speech based solely on content and could be used to target speech that criticized or ridiculed while not penalizing publications that praised or promoted approval. The statute was unconstitutionally overbroad as it impacted not only prohibited speech but also speech that was clearly protected under the First Amendment. The statute was vague and could impermissibly delegate to law enforcement authorities the power to determine what speech was permitted and what was not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, according to the 1995 sentencing guidelines, was subject to a sentencing range from 26 to 42 months in prison. Defendant alleged that rather than potentially face a sentence within that range if convicted, he entered into the plea bargain. Defendant argued that because he was in the window period during which the 1995 sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional the 1994 sentencing guidelines applied and his sentencing range would have been 12 to 20 months in prison. Defendant further alleged that if he had been given a correctly calculated 1994 scoresheet, he would not have entered into the plea bargain, but instead would have gone to trial and risked the lesser sentencing range if convicted. Therefore, his plea was involuntary. On appeal, the court found defendant was not within the group of persons entitled to postconviction relief under Heggs because his downward departure sentence of five years' probation was permissible under both the 1994 and 1995 sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Circuit Court for Monroe County (Florida) with driving while license was suspended (DWLS) as a habitual traffic offender, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(5) (1997). The trial court found 1997 Fla. Laws ch. 300 violated the single-subject rule of the state constitution. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had argued Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34(5) (1997) was unconstitutional because 1997 Fla. Laws ch. 300 violated the single-subject requirement of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. Specifically, he claimed 1997 Fla. Laws ch. 300 altered the penalty for his offense, DWLS as a habitual offender, from a first-degree misdemeanor to a third-degree felony. The State had argued there was no violation of the single-subject rule because all the sections in 1997 Fla. Laws ch. 300 related to vehicles and highway safety. The appellate court initially noted the single-subject requirement of the Florida Constitution was satisfied if a reasonable explanation existed as to why the legislature chose to join the two subjects within the same legislative act. The appellate court held it was clear that the provisions of 1997 Fla. Laws ch. 300 were directed toward one purpose, namely, the regulation and operation of vehicles, and of the concomitant crimes related to such regulation. The appellate court concluded that while 1997 Fla. Laws ch. 300 covered a broad range of provisions, those provisions all related to highway safety and motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into a 30-year franchise agreement also encompassed in a franchise ordinance. The franchise allowed the utility to install and maintain electrical distribution and transmission equipment on the public right of way within the city limits. Upon termination of the franchise agreement, the city had the option of purchasing the utility's distribution facilities within the city limits. The purchase option was mandated by a statute, which provided that the valuation of the utility's assets was to be set by arbitration. Thirteen years later, the parties agreed upon an ordinance to replace the earlier franchise. At the expiration of the replacement ordinance, a third franchise could not be agreed upon. The utility later denied the validity of the purchase option. The appeals court held the city was entitled to enforcement of the provision allowing it to seek the determination of a purchase price through arbitration, even though the statute requiring the valuation of assets by arbitration had been repealed 28 years earlier.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue presented to the appellate court was whether defendant was convicted of the driving under the influence offense based upon the proof admitted at trial relative to his blood alcohol level and the improper application of the presumption of impairment created by Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934 (1995). The State conceded that it was not entitled to the use of the presumption of impairment created by Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934 because defendant's blood alcohol test and results were not obtained in accordance with the core policies of the implied consent law. However, defendant was properly convicted because the evidence of his blood alcohol test results were admitted after the establishment of a three-prong predicate and analysis of Robertson. The jury was not instructed regarding the presumption of impairment created by Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934, nor did the State argue the presumption to the jury. The State met its burden. The presumption of impairment was a moot concern as the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant operated a motor vehicle with an unlawful blood-alcohol level.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged appellee interior designer in the Circuit Court for the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, Broward County (Florida), with being an unlicensed interior designer in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 481.223 (1999). The designer moved to dismiss the charge because Fla. Stat. chs. 481.223(c), 481.229(6) (1999) were unconstitutionally vague. The trial court granted the motion. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The interior designer advertised himself as an interior designer without being licensed or registered as an interior designer. The interior designer argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 481.223(c) (1999), requiring an interior designer to be licensed, and Fla. Stat. ch. 481.229(6) (1999), providing an exception to the interior designer being required to be licensed, were unconstitutionally vague pertaining to the use of the phrases &quot;practicing interior design,&quot; &quot;performing interior design services,&quot; and &quot;interior designer or words to that effect.&quot; On appeal, the court found the statutes were constitutional.  Fla. Stat. ch. 481.223 provided adequate notice of the conduct it prohibited. The exemption in Fla. Stat. ch. 381.229(6) permitted people to do interior design work if they did not advertise as an interior designer. Nothing in the statutes was confusing or rendered the statutes unconstitutionally vague as applied to the interior designer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Duval County, Florida, convicted defendant of robbery and sentenced him to the mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. Defendant appealed the mandatory minimum sentence alleging that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.087 (1999), the 10/20/Life statute, violated the separation of powers provision under Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the 10/20/Life statute was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers provision because it removed all sentencing discretion from the judiciary in qualifying cases and all prosecutorial discretion from the executive in qualifying cases. The appellate court rejected that contention. Defendant's second contention was similarly without merit, because, as written, the 10/20/Life statute did not eliminate all prosecutorial discretion in seeking enhanced penalties under the statute, but instead clearly contemplated that in some qualifying cases prosecutors would use their discretion not to seek enhanced penalties under the statute. While it could be more onerous for a prosecutor to exercise his or her discretion not to seek enhanced penalties under the statute, the 10/20/Life statute did not eliminate that discretion altogether. Thus, the statute did not encroach on the executive's prosecutorial discretion and the trial court properly denied defendant's challenge to the statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state of Florida sued appellant nightclubs, officers, and directors, for constituting an &quot;enterprise&quot; that engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity. The Circuit Court for Orange County, Florida, granted the State's motion for temporary injunction, and denied appellants' motion to dissolve the injunction. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that the nightclubs violated several criminal laws, including those dealing with prostitution and drugs. The trial court's ex parte preliminary injunction froze 12 of the nightclubs' bank accounts; the State later agreed that seven of these accounts should not have been frozen, but the trial court did not modify the injunction. The appellate court held that the injunction was overbroad, since the State failed to meet its burden to connect the frozen accounts with activity forbidden by RICO, and it acknowledged the overbreadth by stipulating to the release of the seven accounts. However, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in not requiring the State to post a bond, as appellants put on no evidence to show that they would incur losses because of the injunction.  Fla. Stat. ch. 895.05(3), allowing seizure of property &quot;upon court process,&quot; meant that the order obtained upon court process had to be based on probable cause sufficient to obtain a warrant under Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12. As so interpreted, RICO did not unconstitutionally allow the seizure of property without due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying the request for the State to post bond was affirmed. The order granting the injunction was affirmed, but since the injunction was overly broad, the case was remanded so the injunction could be modified.</SPAN></P>

The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation presented evidence that for the years 1996, 1997, and 1998, its home was exempt from taxation under I.R.C. &sect; 501(c)(3). The corporation also introduced in evidence affidavits of its residents that accompanied its applications for exemptions under Fla. Stat. ch. 196.1975 (1995). The appellate court dismissed the appraiser's objection to the affidavits as they were not supplied as original evidence, but were attached to the three exemption applications and were, therefore, considered by the appraiser in making his three denials. The corporation contended that as a nonprofit home for the aged it satisfied the requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 196.1975 and was therefore entitled to the tax exemption. It was clear that the corporation had at least 75 percent of their residents over the age of 62 or who were totally or permanently disabled. Because the corporation qualified as a nonprofit organization under I.R.C. &sect; 501(c)(3) and met the requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 196.1975(1), (2) (1995), it was entitled to the homestead exemption relief sought for the years 1996, 1997, and 1998, without regard to the &quot;charitable&quot; use of the property.</SPAN></P>

The boater had also sued the county for helping to enforce the commission's regulations. The trial court denied the commission's motion to dismiss on all grounds. The appellate court was not convinced that the trial judge realized his ruling encompassed the venue issue. Nevertheless, because the motion was denied, it reviewed the venue issue. The boater never pleaded sufficient facts to support the application of the sword-wielder exception to the home venue rule applicable to governmental agencies. Thus, no burden was ever placed upon the commission to refute any allegations with additional evidence. Because the boater had not invoked the exception, venue was improper.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued the trial court erred in allowing the homeowner to testify to the defendant's statement and in sentencing defendant under the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act. The appellate court held that defendant's statement was properly admitted as going to defendant's intent. Even if admission of the statement was improper, any error was harmless. The appellate court did, however, agree that defendant had been improperly sentenced under the Act. The Act applied only to burglary of an occupied dwelling, not an unoccupied dwelling. Although the homeowner's dwelling had unquestionably been occupied at the time of the burglary, the jury had not been given the opportunity to make a finding in that regard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Wakulla County (Florida) granted defendant 17-year-old juvenile's motion to dismiss an information charging him as an adult for the offense of committing a sexual act with a child under the age of 16. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered an order dismissing the charges against the juvenile and transferred the case to juvenile court. The effect of the order was to dismiss the information charging him as an adult. The trial court reasoned the unique facts of the case would have resulted in an unconstitutional application of Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04 (1997) in violation of the juvenile's rights to privacy and equal protection if he were prosecuted as an adult. The appellate court initially noted a minor could be charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04(3) (1997). The court admonished there was no common law right to be specially treated as a juvenile delinquent instead of a criminal offender, and the legislature had the constitutional authority to determine when a child could be charged as a juvenile rather than an adult. The court concluded that the prosecution of a juvenile as an adult was subject to the express terms of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 15(b) and did not violate the juvenile's rights to privacy and equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was released on parole and placed on conditional release pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 947.1405(6). Defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it granted the parole commission unbridled discretion to determine the length, conditions and cost of supervision of conditional release and improperly delegated judicial authority to the parole commission, thereby violating the separation of powers doctrine. The appellate court held the state constitution created the parole commission within the executive branch of government, not the judicial, and it was the commission that had the power to make parole determinations, not the courts. The power granted the commission was not unbridled as the commission was subject to statutory limits imposed upon it by the legislature. The statute did not therefore violate the separation of powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court for Collier County, Florida, granted judgment in favor of appellee employees in appellant State's action for improper disposal of hazardous waste in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 403.727(3)(b) (1999). The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the trial court erred in finding Fla. Stat. ch. 403.727(3)(b) (1999) unconstitutional because the statute proscribed culpably negligent conduct using the terms &quot;by exhibiting reckless indifference or gross careless disregard&quot; and those terms had long been understood in Florida to define culpable negligence. The appellate court held that the State's mistake in citing the statute in an information did not mean that the statute was confusing, nor did it reveal any constitutional infirmity with the statute. The employees admitted that culpable negligence was required by the subsections with which they were charged. Whether the acid spilled in the case was a liquid encompassed by the definition of hazardous waste was to be addressed at trial; it was not an issue that went to the constitutionality of the statute. The statute was not vague and inconsistent. Whether the employees acted knowingly or by exhibiting reckless indifference or gross careless disregard for human health was a factual determination to be made at trial.</SPAN></P>
