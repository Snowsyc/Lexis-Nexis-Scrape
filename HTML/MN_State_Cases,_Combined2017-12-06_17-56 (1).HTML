</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary in the Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota. He appealed, asserting the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress identification evidence. He also asserted that the district court erroneously sentenced him as a career offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 4 (2004) in violation of his right to a jury determination of aggravating sentencing factors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed that a 15-year-old resident of the burglarized home came face to face with defendant. Police stopped defendant on foot not far from the residence within 25 minutes. The aforementioned teenager then identified defendant while looking out the window of a squad car. The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the district court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress the show-up identification. Although the procedure utilized was unnecessarily suggestive, under the totality of the circumstances, the identification had adequate independent origin and was reliable. However, as to defendant's sentencing, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 4 (2004) (the career-offender statute) authorized an upward departure based on a judicial determination at the time of sentencing about the nature of the crime for which sentence was being imposed. The appellate court held that &sect; 609.1095, subd. 4 was unconstitutional to the extent that it authorized a judicial finding that a pattern of criminal conduct existed. Because the statute was unconstitutional as applied to defendant's sentence, a reversal of his sentence was in order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, but his sentence was reversed, and the matter was remanded for resentencing consistent with the appellate court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a general contractor, challenged a grant of summary judgment by the Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, to respondents, several subcontractors, which dismissed the general contractor's third-party claims for contribution and indemnity. The general contractor had brought its third-party claims after it was sued for breach of warranty under Minn. Stat. &sect; 327A.02 (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the general contractor's claims were for contribution and indemnity, the actions were subject to both the two-year statute of limitations and the 10 to 12 year statute of repose, Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(a), served to bar the claims. The general contractor argued that because &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(a) as applied foreclosed its third-party claims before they accrued, that same violated its due-process rights under the state and federal constitutions and its right to a remedy under the Minnesota Constitution. The appellate court held that when a party was sued for breach of statutory warranty and was completely foreclosed from asserting third-party claims for contribution and indemnity by the statute of repose under Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(a) (2002), same violated that party's due-process rights under the federal and state constitutions and its right to a remedy under the Minnesota Constitution. Thus, the district court committed reversible error in granting summary judgment fort the subcontractors. The appellate court emphasized that &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(a), was unconstitutional only as applied to the general contractor's third-party contribution and indemnity claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the president of a bankrupt home construction company, was charged with counts of unlawful failure to use proceeds paid for the improvement to real estate, theft by swindle, theft by false representation, and fraud in obtaining credit. The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, granted defendant's motion to dismiss eight of the counts on grounds that Minn. Stat. &sect; 514.02 (2000) was unconstitutional. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State argued that Minn. Stat. &sect; 514.02 (2000) was constitutional because it did not imprison for the nonpayment of a debt, but criminalized the violation of a statutorily created trust-like relationship between a contractor and a homeowner. The appellate court agreed, finding that it was a contractor's knowing violation of the &quot;trust character&quot; of the payments entrusted to him by the homeowner, rather than any failure to pay a debt to a subcontractor, that made a contractor criminally liable under the statute. The statute punished a contractor's misapplication of payments received from a homeowner, as opposed to punishing the failure to pay a debt owed to subcontractors. Contrary to defendant's contention, the language in Minn. Stat. &sect; 514.02, subd. 1(a) (2000) negating fiduciary liability necessarily applied only to the limited civil cause of action created by the statute in subd. 1(a). The appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in determining that the statute violated the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded to the trial court to reinstate the eight counts of the complaint that were dismissed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order from the Chippewa County District Court (Minnesota), which convicted her of violating Big Bend Township, Minn., Zoning Ordinance Relating to Dogs &sect; 1.04(B).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 1.04(B) was passed approximately one and one-half years after defendant bought her residence. The ordinance prohibited three or more dogs on premises owned by any individual residing in the township's high density population area. Defendant was found guilty of violating the ordinance. On appeal, the court found that defendant failed to meet her burden of proving that it was not even debatable that regulating the number of dogs per residence had a substantial relationship to controlling the problems of dog noise, temperament, and odor as they affected the public health, safety, and welfare. Defendant had not overcome the ordinance's presumption of constitutionality. Further, because defendant's conviction pertained to keeping three or more dogs on her residential premises after the ordinance was passed, it did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws. Finally, because defendant's dog-breeding business, was not in lawful use at the time of the enactment of the ordinance limiting the number of dogs per residential premises, the exception for preexisting nonconforming uses did not permit her continued violation of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, a proposed counselor (counselor), sought review of the decision of respondent, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services (commissioner), which denied the counselor's request to set aside his disqualification from working as a counselor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The counselor challenged the commissioner's decision denying the counselor's request to set aside his disqualification from working as a counselor in a state-licensed program because of his criminal record, including convictions of first-degree and third-degree criminal sexual conduct. The court affirmed however, stating that substantial evidence supported the commissioner's decision and that the counselor had the opportunity and exercised his right to present written evidence to the commissioner. The counselor presented no medical or psychological evidence to support his contention that he was fully rehabilitated. Further, the counselor refused to take responsibility for his actions and blamed the victim for his convictions. Application of the Mathews balancing test showed that an evidentiary hearing was not required to afford the counselor with procedural due process. Providing him with the right to submit evidence in writing was adequate to meet the requirements of due process. Consequently, the statutory language contained in Minn. Stat. &sect; 245C.27, subd. 1(c) (2004) that an applicant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An enhanced sentence was imposed under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.109, subd. 4(a) (2004) for a sexual assault conviction. Thereafter, defendant sought review. The court of appeals affirmed the sentence imposed. In reversing, the court determined that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated by the imposition of the enhanced sentence. The Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines were not merely advisory, pursuant to the language in Minn. Stat. &sect; 244.09, subd. 5. Further, because Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.109, subd. 4 (2004), and Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.D authorized the district court to make an unconstitutional upward durational departure upon finding an aggravating factor without the aid of a jury, these provisions were facially unconstitutional. The court determined that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.109, subd. 4 (2004) was unconstitutional in its entirety. However, the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines were not totally invalidated. Rather, the appropriate remedy was to sever the unconstitutional guideline from the rest of the statutory scheme, pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 645.20. The court declined the State's suggestion to make the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines advisory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was reversed, and the case was remanded to the district court for the imposition of a sentence within the presumptive range.</SPAN></P>

Defense counsel argued during closing that the shirt found shortly after the murder with defendant's DNA and the victim's blood on it was planted by the police, that officers fabricated defendant's confessions, and that defendant's conduct the night of the killing did not comport with the conduct of someone who had recently beaten his girlfriend to death.

The federal court held that the city's failure to hold an immediate election did not violate the federal constitution in light of the city's burdens and costs of holding an extra election and the state's compelling interest in preserving the orderliness and integrity of the election process. The federal court certified the question of whether the Minnesota Constitution afforded greater protection and whether the failure to hold an election violated Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 204B.135, subd. 1, and 204B.14, subd. 1a. The court held that the Minnesota Constitution did not provide greater protection because the right to vote was deemed a fundamental right under both the federal and state constitutions and plaintiffs failed to provide any principled basis for the court to depart from the concept of uniformity in following federal precedent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a couple who owned a small farm, were convicted of selling their meat products without a license under the Minnesota Consolidated Food Licensing Law in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 28A.04, and unauthorized sale of custom-processed meat in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 31A.10(4), in the MeLeod County District Court, Minnesota.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record showed the State's secret agents performed surveillance on the couple and purchased from the couple small quantities of custom-processed ground beef, wieners, pork chops, beef liver, and bacon. Later, a compliance officer picked up an order of meat from the couple. The State then filed its complaints. At issue on appeal was the meaning of Minn. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 7. The supreme court held that the clear and unambiguous language of Minn. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 7 permitted any person to sell the products of his or her farm, including meat products, without obtaining a license. Thus, the couple could not be prosecuted for failure to have obtained a license to sell their meat products. However, Minn. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 7 did not exempt a farmer from health and safety regulations that prohibited the sale of uninspected meat. Further, Minn. Stat. &sect; 31A.15, subd. 1 (2004) only exempted a farmer from inspection regulations for custom-processed meat if the meat was used exclusively in the household of the owner; such use of custom-processed meat did not allow sale of the meat to others. Thus, the couples' convictions for selling custom-processed meat were upheld.</SPAN></P>

He did not specifically direct his words to her, nor was there an indication that he expected his wife to be awake when he entered the house, slammed the front door, pounded down the hallway, and screamed that things had gone wrong.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a pretrial order of the Rice County District Court (Minnesota), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss the racketeering charge against him for lack of probable cause and which denied the State's motion to add second-degree controlled substance offense charges based on defendant's alleged sale of cocaine within a &quot;park zone&quot; as defined in Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to the racketeering charge, the issue was whether the district court's primary finding that there was no evidence of a criminal enterprise between defendant and his parents was a legal determination. The court determined that it was an issue of fact, and that Minn. R. Crim. P. 28.04, subd. 1(1)(a) prohibited the State from appealing a pretrial dismissal if it was based solely on a factual determination dismissing a complaint for lack of probable cause. The court next examined the definition of &quot;park zone&quot; in Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.01 and found that it was ambiguous in its definition of how far from the actual park boundary a &quot;park zone&quot; extended. The phrase &quot;one city block&quot; in &sect; 152.01, subd. 12a, was undefined. The court agreed with defendant that the legislature contemplated cases where the park and its &quot;adjoining areas&quot; were not laid out in city blocks and therefore included the alternative measurement of 300 feet. Because the only evidence on the record showed that the trailers where the alleged drug transactions took place were not within 300 feet of the park, the court affirmed the denial of the motion to add charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator medical laboratory (lab) appealed the judgment of the Tax Court, Office of Appellate Courts (Minnesota), which upheld the MinnesotaCare tax of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 295.50, subd. 4; 295.51, subd. 1; 295.52, subd. 7 (2000) and affirmed the decision of respondent Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue to deny the lab's claims for MinnesotaCare tax exemption (exemption) of revenues from non-Minnesota health-care providers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner allowed the lab to deduct as exempt revenue received from Minnesota entities but disallowed deductions from non-Minnesota receipts. The tax court reasoned that the exemption was not facially discriminatory because it was not based on geography and was internally consistent and thus fairly apportioned because the tax was being assessed on a single taxpayer, the Minnesota lab, and there was no risk that any state would impose tax on the same health-care service more than once. The court affirmed the decision. The exemption was based on whether the revenue was received from a hospital, surgical center, or a health-care provider on whom liability for tax was imposed, without explicit reference to the location of that provider under Minn. Stat. &sect; 295.53, subd. 1(a)(4)-(5). Because decisions of the United States Supreme Court suggested that the Interstate Commerce Clause did not require equal treatment when an exemption was allowed for payment by a third party of a separate in-state tax but not of a separate out-of-state tax, the court affirmed the conclusion that the MinnesotaCare statute was not facially discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, sentenced defendant to an enhanced term of 36 months imprisonment based on the finding that the gun was in close proximity to the drugs and could have been used in furtherance of a drug transaction. Defendant appealed her sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted to possession of Oxycontin without a prescription. Defendant admitted the gun was hers, and that she knew it was under the mattress. In exchange for defendant's guilty plea, the State agreed to recommend a 36-month sentence, and to not pursue a felon-in-possession of a firearm charge against her. Defendant argued that her sentence under the firearm-enhancement statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11, subd. 5(a) (2004), violated her right to a jury trial under the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Blakely. The appellate court found that the factual determinations necessary for the sentence enhancement were a violation of defendant's right to a jury trial under Blakely. The presumptive sentence for defendant's offense without the firearm enhancement would have been far less than 36 months. When the district court sentenced defendant to an enhanced term of 36 months, the firearm enhancement functioned as an aggravating factor. Defendant was entitled to have a jury determine whether she possessed the firearm at the time of the drug offense, and whether the firearm's presence increased the risk of violence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner was 30 years old, and repeatedly sexually assaulted his 11-year old sister from February 1992 through March 1993. The petitioner was 16 years old when the abuse began. During the same time frame, the petitioner molested two of his female cousins. The petitioner also admitted to sexual contact with his uncle's dog, and had several run-ins with the law, including alleged assaults against his parents and a mall security guard. The petitioner pled guilty to first-degree criminal sexual conduct for abusing his sister, and the petitioner was later committed as a sexually dangerous person. The petitioner argued that he was entitled to a jury trial in his civil commitment proceeding. The appellate court ruled that the Minnesota State Constitution did not guarantee a right to a jury trial in a civil commitment proceeding, and there was no federal constitutional right to a jury trial in civil commitment proceedings in the State of Minnesota.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 60C.01-60C.22 (2002), for the amount paid in settling an employee's workers' compensation claim without the employer's consent after the employer's insurer became insolvent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer claimed the trial court erred in construing the MIGA Act to permit the MIGA to maintain a reimbursement claim for the amount paid in a settlement of a workers' compensation claim without the employer's consent; and that Minn. Stat. &sect; 60C.11, subd. 3, prohibited the MIGA from bringing a claim against the employer. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment for the MIGA. The court held that an implied authority to settle claims without the insured's consent was inferred from the statutory scheme in light of the broad description of the MIGA's powers in Minn. Stat. &sect; 60C.05, subd. 2(d) and (e); the absence of any consent requirement in Minn. Stat. &sect; 60C.11, subd. 7; and the remedial purpose of the Act. The court held that &sect; 60C.11, subd. 7 was more specific and had been added to the Act more recently, thus it prevailed over &sect; 60C.11, subd. 3, and permitted the MIGA to recover from an insured with a net worth over $ 25 million. The court did not address the employer's challenge of the constitutionality of the Act because the employer failed to notify the attorney general of its challenge as required by Minn. R. Civ. App. P. 144 and the MIGA was not a state agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) that convicted him of failure to stop at a stoplight, a violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.89, subds. 1, 2 (2002), and that sentenced him to a fine of $ 300. In his appeal, defendant raised the issues of discriminatory enforcement of traffic laws, rejection of his midtrial request for a continuance to obtain counsel, and the excessiveness of the $ 300 fine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the traffic laws were discriminatorily enforced because the police officers did not stop the first car that went through the intersection, which was driven by a white person. The court found that defendant waived his discriminatory enforcement defense because he did not raise the issue before trial. The court noted that even if the issue had been properly raised, defendant failed to show that he was singled out based on an impermissible classification. The record provided two logical, nondiscriminatory reasons for stopping defendant's car and provided no evidence that the officers knew of the other driver's race. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's continuance request as untimely and in concluding that it was an attempt to delay the proceedings because defendant stated that he was representing himself and he had a full opportunity to secure an attorney or to request a continuance before trial began, but waited until the State completed its case in chief. Also, the fine was not excessive because it was not disproportionate to the gravity of the offense or the penalty imposed for similar offenses in Minnesota and in other states.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment, holding that defendant failed to timely raise or prove discriminatory enforcement, the denial of the continuance was within the trial court's discretion, and the fine was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen sought to have a charter amendment placed on the ballot that would require the city to authorize and regulate medical marijuana distribution centers. The trial court denied the citizen's request for an injunction based on its finding that the amendment was unconstitutional, preempted by state and federal law, and was an improper initiative rather than an amendment. The citizen argued that where the technical requirements for amendment proposals had been met, the city had a mandatory duty to place all proposed charter amendments on the ballot. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court found that the amendment was subject to the doctrine of preemption and the judicially-created requirement that proposed charter provisions not be &quot;manifestly unconstitutional.&quot; The court found that the legislature, by virtue of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 152.021-.029, had indicated its intent to occupy the field of marijuana regulation and, thus, preempted municipal action. The court concluded that the phrase &quot;manifestly unconstitutional&quot; had never been interpreted as barring only those proposed amendments that were proven to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that the officers did not have reasonable suspicion to justify a pat down and that they exceed the permissible scope of a pat down. The court affirmed the trial court judgment. The court found that the officers had reasonable suspicion to seize defendant and perform a pat down because they saw him give the man a package after talking on his cell phone, he was at a bar that had a long history of drug traffic and shootings, and his behavior was &quot;suspicious&quot; under the circumstances. The court rejected defendant's claim that the pat search exceeded the permissible boundaries of a Terry stop because although there was conflicting evidence regarding whether the officer patted or squeezed the bulge in defendant's clothes, the officer did not manipulate the package in an unconstitutionally improper way and the officer could seize what he believed to be contraband under the &quot;plain feel&quot; exception.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of a judgment of the Rice County District Court (Minnesota), which denied the State's motion to add a charge of second-degree controlled-substance crime to its complaint against defendant. The State argued that defendant's alleged sale of drugs took place in a &quot;park zone&quot; as required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.022, subd. 1(6)(i) (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State asserted that the mobile home from which defendant allegedly sold drugs was on the same &quot;city block&quot; as a municipal park and that the southernmost portion of the mobile-home court in which defendant's mobile home was located was within 300 feet of the municipal park, satisfying the element in that the alleged sale took place within a park zone. The district court held, as a matter of law, that the alleged sale did not take place in a park zone. The court determined that the area described by the State did not meet the definition of a city block because it was only bounded on two sides by streets or avenues. The court also determined that it was clear from the aerial photograph in the record that the mobile home from which the alleged sale was made was not within one city block of the park. The State's focus on the location of the mobile-home court rather than the location of the sale was misplaced because the statute required that the sale had to occur within the park zone in order for the statute to apply. Because it was undisputed that the sale occurred more than 300 feet from the park, the trial court did not err in denying the State's motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Dakota County District Court (Minnesota), which convicted him of fifth-degree controlled-substance offense. On appeal, defendant challenged the district court's pretrial order denying his motion to suppress evidence. He argued that the search warrant at issue was not supported by probable cause and the police illegally seized his garbage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant told the county drug task force that an individual, identified as defendant, was selling methamphetamine from his residence. A police officer retrieved the household garbage defendant had left in a container outside his residence for pickup by a contracted sanitation service. Police searched the garbage and discovered items containing methamphetamine residue. On the basis of this discovery, and the fact that defendant had two previous controlled-substance convictions, the sheriff's department obtained a search warrant. Defendant argued that the information provided by the confidential informant did not provide probable cause to issue the search warrant because the State did not establish the informant's reliability. The record was clear that although the confidential informant gave the information leading to the garbage search, probable cause for the warrant was provided by the discovery of methamphetamine residue in defendant's garbage. The court then noted that there was no evidence defendant took any steps to protect the area or the container from passers-by. Defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the container.</SPAN></P>

The prosecutor stated that he had seen some of the slides for the first time during the expert testimony and that the slides were of critical importance because the expert was using them to date the injuries. The trial court, sua sponte, granted a mistrial. Defendant argued, inter alia, that his retrial was barred on double-jeopardy grounds because a mistrial was not a manifest necessity in his first trial. The court of appeals agreed. A clarification of the expert's testimony as to how many of the slides contained his own iron staining, the limitation of his further testimony about his own tests, the striking of testimony about his own tests, a cautionary instruction, a short continuance to allow the State's expert to review the tests, and rebuttal testimony were a few of the obvious alternatives to a mistrial. Those would have been reasonable options, considering the inescapable fact that there simply was no dispute about the existence of old blood and previous head trauma.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Minnesota Department of Public Safety sustained the revocation of respondent driver's license after administrative review. The driver sought a declaratory judgment and asked a Minnesota district court to hold that the Implied Consent Law (amended 2003) violated procedural due process. The district court determined that the Implied Consent Law's prehearing revocation procedures violated due process. Two questions were certified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was arrested for driving while impaired. A schedule II substance was found in the driver's blood. The driver raised the defense that the drug was prescribed. The two questions certified for review were (1) whether the current version of the implied consent scheme violated due process and (2) whether the 1980 version of the law was revived, and if not, what version was revived? The supreme court was required to determine whether immediately available administrative review, combined with an unspecified period for judicial review, provided a sufficiently meaningful postrevocation review that protected the driver's due process rights. The supreme court determined that the 2003 amendments to Minnesota's Implied Consent Law were unconstitutional because there was no requirement in the amendments that a review hearing be prompt; therefore, the 2003 amendments eliminated a critical due process element to the Implied Consent Law. The supreme court's answer to the second part of the second certified question was that the version of the Implied Consent Law that was revived was the version that existed immediately prior to the 2003 amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court answered the certified questions by determining that the 2003 amendments were unconstitutionally violative of due process and that the version of the Implied Consent that was revived was the one that existed immediately prior to the 2003 amendments. The driver's motion to strike the Commissioner's brief and for fees and costs was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Renville County District Court (Minnesota) that committed him as a sexually dangerous person (SDP) under Minn.

Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 18b (2004), based on the trial court's findings that he was highly likely to reoffend and could not control his impulses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed the record did not support the findings that he was likely to reoffend or that he could not control his impulses, and that his commitment violated double jeopardy and due process. The court affirmed the trial court judgment, holding that there was clear and convincing evidence to support defendant's commitment as an SDP and an SPP. The court found that even though the experts differed in their opinion, both experts testified that defendant received high scores on tests that were above the cutoff for a clinical psychopath and reflected a high likelihood of violent re-offense. Also defendant failed to appreciate the seriousness of his offenses and the need for treatment. The court noted that the Minnesota Supreme Court has rejected the argument that the SDP and SPP statutes violated double jeopardy, and has held that as long as civil commitment was programmed to provide treatment and periodic review, due process was provided. The court noted that the trial court had made significant changes to the State's proposed findings and that verbatim adoption of proposed findings was not reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police went to search defendant's apartment. The warrant did not describe the items to be seized.

The amended warrant also failed to include a description of the items to be seized. While the lead officer was gone, defendant's acquaintance brought a videotape to the apartment. When the waiting officers asked about the tape, the acquaintance gave it to them. The officers viewed the tape, which recorded defendant robbing, assaulting, and holding an unidentified man at defendant's apartment for several hours. On appeal, the State conceded that the warrant was invalid, that the search of defendant's apartment was unconstitutional, that the tape should not have been admitted into evidence, and that the convictions should be reversed. Despite the State's concession, the court conducted an independent analysis. It found that because the videotape was obtained during a search for which the warrant was invalid, the tape was &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree.&quot; The court determined that there were not independent means that would purge the primary taint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his motion to suppress was denied, defendant was convicted of a fifth-degree controlled-substance crime in the Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota. He appealed, asserting the warrant for the search of his residence illegally authorized an unannounced entry because the application relied on past arrests for crimes involving weapons and provided no other articulable suspicion to support a no-knock provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the record showed the supporting affidavit stated that a confidential reliable informant (CRI) had seen defendant in possession of substantial amounts of marijuana. Further, shortly before the application for the warrant, defendant sold marijuana to a CRI. The affidavit also listed crimes for which defendant previously had been arrested, which included aggravated robbery, second-degree assault with a dangerous weapon, and possession of a machine gun and/or short-barreled shotguns. Thus, the magistrate issued a search warrant authorizing an unannounced entry. The appellate court noted that to justify an unannounced entry, police had to have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit an effective investigation by, for example, allowing the destruction of evidence. The latter standard was less than a probable cause standard. The mere presence of firearms alone did not suffice under the reasonable suspicion standard, but defendant's violent criminal history, in conjunction with said weapons, raised a concern for officer safety and allowed for a no-knock search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to consecutive sentences of 120 months on the first count, which was a double durational departure from the presumptive sentence, and 60 months on the second count, which was an upward departure from the 21-month presumptive sentence. The appellate court ruled that the upward durational departures were constitutionally invalid under the U.S. Supreme Court Blakely decision. The district court based its dangerous-offender departure on judicial findings that defendant was a danger to public safety, had a high-frequency rate of offending, and had a long criminal history. The district court also relied on judicial findings that the victim was vulnerable, and that the crime was particularly cruel, both aggravating factors that would justify a departure under the sentencing guidelines. Defendant's sentence exceeded the maximum sentence the district court could impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in his plea, and the district court relied on facts that were neither admitted by defendant nor found by a jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consecutive sentencing was affirmed, but the upward durational departures were reversed and the case was remanded for determination of the individual sentences.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the use of civil license revocations to enhance the criminality of his DWI charge under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.24 (2002), violated his constitutional right to due process. The appellate court ruled that the use of civil license revocations to enhance the DWI charge did not violate the right to due process. Judicial review of the civil revocation was available to defendant, but defendant did not seek such review. Meaningful review was available, and the requirement that an alternative means of obtaining review must be made available was satisfied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty, defendant was sentenced to a presumptive term of 27 months in prison for first-degree burglary, 54 months for second-degree assault involving one victim, which represented a double durational departure; and 21 months for second-degree assault of another victim. The trial court ordered the 54-month assault sentence to be served concurrently with the burglary sentence, and the 21-month assault sentence to be served consecutively. On appeal, defendant challenged the upward departure and the imposition of a consecutive sentence. The court found that even if defendant's guilty plea could be read to include admissions to support findings on the aggravating factors, his plea did not include a waiver of his right to a jury trial on the sentencing factors. Thus, the trial court erred in imposing a departure. The court further found, however, that the trial court's decision to impose consecutive sentences did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the consecutive sentence. The court reversed the decision to depart and remanded the case for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the underlying action, plaintiff, a homeowner, sued defendant, a contractor for defective construction just before the tenth anniversary of the completion of the home. After said tenth year, the contractor then sued third party defendants, three subcontractors, for contribution and indemnity. The Dakota County District Court, Minnesota, held the contractor's claims were barred by a statute of repose. The contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issue was whether the district court correctly determined that Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(a) (2002), barred initiation of a contribution and indemnity suit in the 11th year after completion of said construction. The appellate court noted that &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(a) (providing for a 10 year limitation period), was a statute of repose added to the statute of limitation, declaring an ultimate repose of a contribution or indemnity action, regardless of when the cause of action arose. On the other hand, Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 2 (2002), provided that no action of the kind addressed by Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 1 (2002) could &quot;be brought&quot; more than 12 years after construction was completed. After examining legislative intent, and seeking to avoid an absurd interpretation, the appellate court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(a) (2002) deemed accrual of a party's contribution and indemnity claims to &quot;occur at the end of the 10th year&quot; following completion of construction. Further, because &sect; 541.051, subd. 1(a) permitted commencement of action on the claims in the following two years after &quot;discovery of the injury,&quot; the contractor's actions were timely.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and the matter was remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to trial, defendant pleaded guilty to driving-after-cancellation and stipulated to his cancellation to avoid the jury hearing evidence concerning his driving record. At trial, the police officer testified without objection that defendant was &quot;cancelled.&quot; Defendant argued that the trial court erred by admitting prejudicial statements regarding his driving record, and that a White Earth Tribal Police Officer lacked the authority to stop, detain, or search him. The appellate court held that the testimony regarding defendant's driving record was improper because of the strong inference that his cancellation was due to a prior DWI conviction; however, he was not automatically entitled to reversal because he failed to show that he was so prejudiced by the admission of the officer's &quot;cancelled&quot; testimony that he did not receive a fair trial. The appellate court further held that the law-enforcement arrangement between the State of Minnesota and the White Earth Tribal Police Force did not violate federal law or the constitution; thus, evidence derived from the officer's stop, search, and seizure of defendant and his vehicle was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by including a custody-status point in his criminal-history score when it calculated the presumptive sentence for his conviction of third-degree criminal sexual conduct. The district court included a custody-status point because it found that defendant was on probation when he committed the offense. Defendant argued that the U.S. Supreme Court Blakely decision required a jury determination that he was on probation because it was a fact that increased his sentence. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not err by including a custody-status point in defendant's criminal-history score and imposing the presumptive sentence for his third-degree criminal-sexual-conduct conviction. A finding of a custody-status point fit within Blakely's exception for facts of prior convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the State contended, inter alia, that 2003 Minn.

Laws ch. 28, arts. 2-3 related to handgun permitting and firearm regulation, while 2003 Minn. Laws ch. 28, art. 1 related to the single subject of natural resources or the environment. Thus, the two disparate subjects lacked a legitimate connection to one another and failed the germaneness analysis. As such, the appellate court held that 2003 Minn. Laws ch. 28 was unconstitutional in violation of the single-subject requirement. The appellate court agreed with the trial court's determination that severance of 2003 Minn.

She pleaded guilty to nine counts in a straight plea. Defendant charged that the upward departure of her sentence violated her right to a jury trial under Blakely. The court noted that under Blakely, an upward durational departure could not be based on an admission by defendant unless it was accompanied by defendant's waiver of her right to a jury trial on the aggravating factor. The court held that defendant orally waived her right to a jury trial but that she did not explicitly acknowledge and waiver her right to testify and to have prosecution witnesses testify. Therefore, the record was not sufficient to demonstrate that defendant knowingly waived those rights. The court also held that defendant was not automatically entitled on remand to a reduction of her sentence to the presumptive sentence. Because the appropriate remedy, including the possible impaneling of a jury to determine the sentencing issues, had not been fully litigated, it had to be determined in the first instance by the district court.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court noted that pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 13(a)(1), (3) (2004), the requirement of a showing of a likelihood of harm was crucial because a mentally ill person's confinement was unconstitutional if he was dangerous to no one and could live safely in freedom. The appellate court agreed with the patient that the findings regarding his inability to obtain necessities were insufficient. The district court made no findings on the patient's failure to take his medication consistently. The patient's verbal confrontations with others, without more, were insufficient to show that there was a substantial likelihood of physical harm to himself or others, as required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the inmate challenged the denial of his postconviction petition, arguing that the trial court properly asserted jurisdiction over his claim because fines were a direct consequence of a conviction. The appellate court found that defendant did not challenge the judgment of conviction nor did he challenge the trial court's imposition of the fine as part of his sentence. Rather, he challenged the department's authority to collect wages for payment of the fine, contending that Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.23, subd. 3 (2002) did not grant authority to the department to collect wages for payment of a fine arising from a sentence that had expired. Because defendant's challenge related to a condition of his confinement and was not a challenge to the judgment of conviction or the imposed sentence, the appellate court held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to consider defendant's unauthorized-deduction claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two cases, the Stearns County District Court, Minnesota, and the Anoka County District Court, Minnesota, upheld the constitutionality of Minnesota's Child Support Guidelines.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both fathers argued that Minnesota's child-support guidelines violated the United States Constitution's Supremacy, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses because the child-support guidelines impacted their fundamental right to control their care of their children. There was no precedent cited, however, holding that one parent had a fundamental right over the other parent in respect to child-support obligations. There was also no merit in the argument that gender was implicated in the statutory scheme. There was also no merit to the claim that courts mechanically look to the child support guidelines. As to the Equal Protection Clause analysis, the fathers failed to make the threshold showing that they, as noncustodians, were similarly situated with respect to the custodians. Moreover, the legislature was well within in its constitutional authority in deciding to maximize recovery of child support. As to due process, the legislature allowed for deviations from the guidelines, and the guidelines furthered reasonable objectives. Finally, the fathers failed to show that the existing Minnesota guidelines conflicted with or violate the mandates of federal law.</SPAN></P>

Her driver's license was revoked by respondent, the Minnesota Commissioner of Public Safety. The Dakota County District Court, Minnesota, affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At about 2:25 a.m., a clerk at a gas station notified a police dispatcher that a motorist appeared to be sleeping behind the wheel of a van, parked with its motor running, directly in front of the station. The officer arrived, and based on past experience, he suspected the motorist was impaired. On appeal, the motorist first argued, correctly, that she was seized when the officer parked his squad car behind her vehicle, preventing her exit. However, the primary issue was whether the officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to justify the investigative seizure, primarily with respect to the clerk's tip. Although not identified by name, the dispatcher knew the caller was a clerk at the gas station, and the officer could have easily identified the caller. Therefore, it was unlikely the caller would have provided false information. Because the clerk witnessed the situation first hand, there was a factual basis for her knowledge as an informant. The appellate court held that in conjunction with the officer's personal observations and experience and given the totality of the circumstances, he had a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity to seize defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's finding that there was no merit in his constitutional arguments, partly because he erroneously depicted his record. The individual improperly overlooked his 1998 conviction for terroristic threats, which the trial court appropriately found to contain a sexual component. Thus, the record showed five serious sexual conduct crimes between 1984 and 1998, not atypical for a sexually dangerous person determination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was an assisted living facility. The question was whether &sect; 272.02, subd. 26(D) limited the exemption to housing that existed and was unassessed before the 1991 tax levy and whether &sect; 272.02, subd. 26(ii) limited the exemption to housing for low-income residents. The court held that the &quot;while&quot; clause within &sect; 272.02, subd. 26(D) established a time relationship and that the provision required a structure situated on real property to have been in existence before the 1991 tax levy to be eligible for a tax exemption. The taxpayer was not eligible for exemption under &sect; 272.02, subd. 26(D). Also, the purpose was to create a remedy for those properties affected by a tax increase that affected the ability of low-income housing property owners to offer affordable rents to tenants. Further, the time cutoff at 1991 was reasonably related to the statute's remedial purpose of allowing the affected properties a partial exemption for reasonably unanticipated property tax increases, and the partial exemption provided in &sect; 272.02, subd. 26 was rational because the sudden increase in taxes could enforce a hardship on those properties' ability to provide low-income housing.</SPAN></P>

He also asserted the trial court misconstrued the applicable statute.</SPAN></P>

He based his bias theory on a lawsuit the officer had brought against his employer. The suit was pending at the time of the traffic stop and alleged that a fence that the company installed on the officer's property had failed to restrain the officer's dog, leading to the dog's death. The trial court sustained the State's relevance objections to the documents and the testimony of defendant's witnesses in the latter regard. But defendant's attorney was allowed to establish the nature of said lawsuit. The appellate court held defendant was able to present his theory of bias during cross-examination, and that pursuant to Minn. R.

The appellate court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court misconstrued Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court erred in not dismissing the charge because the evidence against him was obtained after the initial scope of the stop was unconstitutionally expanded. The appellate court noted that defendant made no attempt to argue that the stop was illegal and the appellate court deemed any question regarding the legality of the stop to be waived. Although the police officer did not need an articulable reason to order defendant out of the car, in order to properly conduct the search for the bat-type weapon, defendant was justified in requesting the individuals step out of the car. The officer was justified in confining defendant for the officer's safety because the individuals were suspected of having recently been involved in a potentially violent crime with a possible bat-type weapon. It was reasonable for the officer to confine defendant in the back seat of a squad car while a search for the bat-type weapon was conducted. During the detention, the officer detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from defendant. Thus, there was a continued basis to detain defendant.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to 45 months in prison, but the trial court stayed execution of the prison sentence and placed him on probation. Thereafter, the trial court revoked defendant's probation and sentenced him to 30 months in prison. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions stemmed from an incident at his estranged wife's home. As part of defendant's probationary sentence, the trial court specifically prohibited him from having contact with the victim. Defendant's probation officer later filed a violation report alleging that defendant had placed telephone calls to the victim's residence and lied about the calls when asked by the probation officer. On appeal, defendant challenged the trial court's revocation of his probation, arguing that he had no prior probation violations, that his violations were technical, and that a sanction short of imprisonment was reasonable. The appellate court held that to revoke probation, the trial court had to identify the probationary condition(s) that were violated, find that any violations were intentional or inexcusable, and balance the need for confinement with policies favoring probation. The appellate court found that the trial court's revocation order properly evaluated the probation revocation factors and correctly determined that defendant violated his probation when he telephoned the victim's residence and when he lied about the calls to his probation officer.</SPAN></P>

The Redwood County District Court, Minnesota, sentenced defendant to 120 months, an upward departure from the presumptive sentence of 51 months for third-degree criminal sexual conduct, and ordered the sentence to run concurrently to the 84-month sentence defendant was already serving and dismissed two pending charges. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of his conviction, defendant was serving an 84-month sentence for aiding and abetting kidnapping, false imprisonment, and coercion. In addition, defendant had charges pending against him for third-degree assault and escape from custody. Defendant argued that the upward durational departure violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial as defined by the U.S. Supreme Court in Blakely. The appellate court ruled that there was nothing in the record, other than the statement of defendant's counsel at the sentencing hearing that defendant had given up his right to have a contested hearing over the upward departure, to indicate that defendant knowingly waived his right to a jury trial. The State argued that defendant's agreement to the upward departure should suffice as a waiver; however, an upward durational departure could not be based on defendant's admission to an aggravating factor unless the admission was accompanied by defendant's oral or written waiver of his or her right to a jury trial on the aggravating factor. Also, the district court did not err in imposing a ten-year conditional release.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual entered into a stipulation with the state for commitment as a sexually dangerous person and a sexual psychopathic personality. The individual reserved his right to challenge his commitment on constitutional grounds and also reserved his right to a review hearing prior to an indeterminate commitment. After the trial court denied his constitutional challenges to the commitment statutes, the individual filed a motion to withdraw the stipulation which was also denied. The appellate court affirmed the denial of the individual's constitutional challenges and the denial of his motion to vacate his stipulation. The appellate court held that there was no right to a jury trial in a civil commitment hearing under either the Minnesota or United States Constitutions. The appellate court also held that as the trial court entered into a lengthy colloquy with defendant before accepting his stipulation, the trial court did not err in finding that the individual knowingly and voluntarily entered into the stipulation. Finally, the appellate court held it was premature to consider whether Minn. Exec. Order No. 03-10, 28 Minn. Reg. 57 (July 21, 2003) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's driver's license was suspended for failure to pay child support, and defendant was later cited for driving with a suspended license. Defendant, on appeal from the criminal conviction of driving after suspension, challenged the propriety of the order suspending his driver's license. Defendant contested the administrative agency's statutory authority to suspend his license, however, the appellate court ruled that the challenge constituted an impermissible collateral attack on the administrative order. A challenge to an administrative order suspending defendant's driver's license pursued during an appeal from a later criminal conviction for driving after suspension constituted an impermissible collateral attack on the judgment. Also, since defendant committed a criminal offense in Ramsey County, Minnesota, the trial court properly exercised its jurisdiction over the subject matter. Furthermore, defendant's due process rights were not violated by the absence of written findings or a memorandum of law. The district court made oral findings, and these findings were more than adequate to permit appellate review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on allegations of equity stripping, the Minnesota Attorney General brought an action against relators, two real estate sales and mortgage originator licensees and their company (hereinafter, the company). The district court then issued a temporary injunction. Later, respondent, the Commissioner for the Minnesota Department of Commerce, suspended the company's license. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was alleged to have engaged in a fraudulent practice which targeted homeowners with substantial equity in their homes who were facing foreclosure. The company asserted that the Commissioner's notice violated procedural due process and that he erroneously considered conduct underlying the temporary injunction, rather than the fact of the injunction itself. However, the record showed that the notice cited to both Minn. Stat. &sect; 82.27, subd. 1 (2002) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 58.12, subd. 1 (2002), and those statutes plainly stated that when a licensee was subject to discipline as a result of an injunction, the consequences could include the revocation or suspension. Thus, the company had adequate notice. The appellate court rejected the company's argument, that because the basis for the disciplinary action was the underlying injunction, that the requirements of procedural due process were not satisfied. Again, the company was informed of the potential consequences. Moreover, the company had stipulated to the entire injunction order. Consequently, the Commissioner properly adopted the findings of the district court. Finally, the sanction imposed was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Reports indicated that the tenant's companion began to receive social security payments in 2001, but that he failed to report such income to the CDA on the tenant's subsequent recertification applications.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant had received Section 8 assistance since 1981. When the tenant's companion moved in with her in July 2001, they both applied for a family townhome. However, in meetings with the CDA, they did not mention the companion's social-security income. Further, they did not mention the companion's social-security income on 2002 and 2003 recertification applications. The tenant argued that her benefits should not have been cancelled where the CDA did not prove that her failure to comply with registration requirements was &quot;willful,&quot; and that she was not given notice of income-reporting mistakes on her registration or 10 days to correct those mistakes. However, the appellate court held that under the applicable regulations, there was no requirement that a failure to comply with Section 8 registration procedures had to be willful, or that an applicant be given an opportunity to correct mistakes in reported income within 10 days. The responsibility to provide true and complete information regarding income rested with the family pursuant to 24 C.F.R. &sect; 982.551(b).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the district court's denial of the County's petition to commit appellant, the district court concluded that the elements of an SDP case were established where a psychologist testified that he revised his opinion and believed that appellant was highly likely to engage in further sexually motivated stalking behavior. The court affirmed and held following the court's previous opinion, that although appellant did not have physical sexual contact with his victims, his stalking behaviour constituted harmful sexual conduct. The court noted that in the original case, it was determined that he lacked the ability to adequately control his sexual impulses. The court held that there was clear and convincing evidence that appellant was likely to re-offend. Also, in following the Linehan factors, the record supported the conclusion that appellant's acts created a substantial likelihood of serious harm and the district court evaluated the evidence pertaining to each factor. Finally, Minnesota courts have rejected the argument that appellant was entitled to a jury trial because the Minnesota Constitution did not guarantee a right to a jury trial in a civil commitment proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into an agreement with the State where he waived his right to a jury trial, agreed to submit a stipulated record to the trial court, and agreed that neither side would be able to cross-examine witnesses. Based on the stipulated record, the Beltrami County District Court, Minnesota, found defendant guilty of refusal to submit to chemical testing under Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.20, subd. 2 (2002). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the trial court violated his right to present a defense of reasonable refusal by excluding testimony regarding the basis for his refusal to submit to the chemical test. The appellate court disagreed, finding that defendant was allowed to present such evidence at trial, which was reflected in the stipulated record that was before the trial court; bad legal advice was not a valid excuse for refusing to submit to a chemical test. Defendant's ignorance of the consequences of his actions was not a defense. The fact that there was a less-demanding standard for an officer to stop someone suspected of driving under the influence than there was for the same suspect to be later found guilty at trial did not in any way impinge defendant's constitutional guarantee of due process. Defendant's argument that he was not given sufficient warning as to the consequences of his refusal to test failed, as he stipulated that the Implied Consent Advisory was read to him, that the advisory stated that refusal to submit to testing was a crime, and that he was given an opportunity to speak with an attorney before deciding whether to submit to testing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An informant told police that someone appeared to be tampering with a car at a remote location. When an officer arrived on the scene, he recognized defendant and stopped the car. The officer was erroneously told that there was a warrant for defendant's arrest. During a search, drugs were located. Defendant's motion to suppress was denied, and he sought review. On appeal, the court determined that, despite the informant's statement, the officer did not have specific and articulable facts justifying the stop. However, the evidence obtained during the search was not subject to suppression as &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree.&quot; Defendant's act of resisting arrest constituted an intervening circumstance. He was lawfully arrested for obstructing legal process, and the subsequent search was a legal search incident to arrest. However, the court determined that legal fees should not have been charged to defendant under Minn. Stat. &sect; 611.17, subd. 1(c) (Supp. 2003), which had been declared unconstitutional. The court found that defendant could have been required to pay the fees under Minn. R. Crim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of the motion to suppress was affirmed. The assessment of the copayment was reversed, and the case was remanded for a determination of whether defendant was able to make the payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant detainee sex offenders claimed that the Minn. Stat. &sect; 246.0141 (Supp. 2003) violated a number of constitutional rights under both the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. Respondent governor and respondent commissioner brought a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The district court found for the governor and commissioner and granted the motion. The detainees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted Minn. Stat. &sect; 246.0141 (Supp. 2003), prohibiting the possession or use of tobacco in state-operated facilities, which included the Minnesota Sex Offender Program. The detainees first challenged the statute by arguing that it violated Minn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 17. The purpose of this constitutional provision was to prevent what was called &quot;log rolling legislation&quot; or &quot;omnibus bills&quot; by which a number of different and disconnected subjects were united in one bill, and then carried through by a combination of interests. Nevertheless, as the district court concluded, the enactment of the statute was for the purpose of enhancing the health of individuals in regional treatment centers by eliminating the possession or use of tobacco products. The district court did not err in finding that no constitutional privacy rights existed to use or possess tobacco within these state-run facilities. Using a rational basis test, the appellate court concluded that the state goal of curtailing smoking was legitimate. The district court did not err in finding that Minn. Stat. &sect; 246.0141 (Supp. 2003) was not in violation of the detainees' equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a hearing, there was evidence presented that appellant had made various threats, at least one resulting in a restraining order. While Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.714, subd. 6(b) (Supp. 2003) allowed an applicant to submit additional information after an initial denial, appellant did not submit such information. The court held that because of appellant's failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the court declined to consider the sheriff's office's handling of the application. As to any surprise evidence at the trial court hearing, appellant could have used discovery procedures and all incidents involved his own past conduct. Also, while the trial court referred to the sheriff's decision, when viewed in context, the trial court concluded de novo that the statutory standard for denial of a permit had been met. The court noted that the existence of the restraining order was uncontroverted, it supported the trial court's decision, and the court considered the document itself. Finally, based on the level of harassment being serious enough to warrant a restraining order, appellant's violation of the order, and police testimony, the trial court's findings were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual had numerous complaints of sexual misconduct. The trial court committed the individual and the court affirmed on appeal. The court rejected the individual's claim that he was entitled to a jury trial in this matter. The Minnesota Constitution did not guarantee a right to a jury trial in a civil commitment proceeding at present. There was sufficient evidence presented to support the finding that the individual was an SDP. The trial court found that the individual engaged in a course of harmful sexual conduct, as defined in Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 7a (2002), with others. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it relied on expert testimony, along with other corroborating evidence, in reaching its decision. Under Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping in the Anoka County District Court, Minnesota. He appealed, asserting that the district court erred by failing to give the jury a specific unanimity instruction and in admitting highly prejudicial hearsay evidence. He also asserted there was insufficient evidence to support his kidnapping conviction and that the district court plainly erred in sentencing him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that, because the State charged him with four acts of sexual penetration in two counts, the district court was required to instruct the jurors that they had to unanimously agree as to which acts formed the basis for each count. The appellate court held that since the jurors were instructed that they had to agree unanimously in count one that defendant sexually penetrated the victim, they did not have to be told that they had to be unanimous as to how that penetration occurred. Regarding count two, it was unarguable that defendant engaged in a single course of conduct involving various means of sexual penetration. Thus, the district court did not err in simply instructing that penetration meant sexual intercourse. Secondly, the appellate court held the district court properly allowed the victim to testify to statements defendant made about slapping his victims since same was probative as to the victim's fear. However, the victim's confinement was incidental to the sexual assault, requiring reversal of defendant's kidnapping conviction, and the district court's aggravated durational departure did not comply with the criminal friendly case of Blakely v. Washington.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for criminal sexual conduct was affirmed. His conviction for kidnapping was reversed. The matter was remanded for resentencing, as the district court had based its aggravated durational departure on facts that defendant did not admit or that were not found by the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of fourth-degree and fifth-degree criminal sexual conduct. The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) sentenced defendant to 102 months after concluding that he was a dangerous offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 1(d) (2002). Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that counsel was ineffective because counsel conceded defendant's guilt to fifth-degree criminal sexual conduct during closing arguments without defendant's consent. The appellate court concluded that defendant had little opportunity to appreciate that a concession was made when counsel declined surrebuttal after the prosecutor stated that defendant conceded guilt, and there was no record of whether counsel obtained defendant's consent to such a trial strategy. Defendant also alleged that the jury instructions improperly shifted the burden of guilty to him. The appellate court found no error, noting that in the two instances where the trial court misstated the burden of proof, it quickly corrected the statement and thus, the misstatements did not result in confusion for the jury. Next, the appellate court concluded that, contrary to his contention, defendant waived his right to testify and that said waiver was counseled, knowing, and voluntary. Finally, the appellate court concluded that defendant's sentence was improperly based on factors that went beyond mere criminal history and that were not admitted or found by a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of his petition for postconviction relief and his conviction by the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, of unlawful possession of a firearm. Defendant argued that a prior probation-discharge order informed him that all of his civil rights were restored, including the right to possess a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1992, defendant was convicted of a non-violent felony and sentenced to probation. The probation agreement defendant signed stated that any person who had been convicted as a felon could not lawfully own, use or possess a firearm until the conviction was expunged, set aside, pardoned or until civil rights were restored. In 1997, defendant was discharged from probation. The district court order stated that defendant was &quot;discharged from probation and restored to all civil rights and to full citizenship with full right to vote and hold office the same as if said conviction had not taken place.&quot; Further, while there was a place on the order to restrict defendant's possession of a firearm for 10 years, that box was not checked. Defendant was arrested for unlawful possession of a firearm in 1999. The appellate court reversed the conviction and held that the State could not indicate that defendant had the right to possess firearms when all his civil rights were reinstated, tell him all his civil rights were reinstated, and then tell him that he should have known he could not possess a firearm. Thus, Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV prohibited his conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the district court's denial of defendant's postconviction relief and vacated his conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The criminal activity alleged in the affidavit was that defendant was selling drugs out of his apartment. The affidavit stated that the confidential reliable informant made a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from defendant and was given a phone number to contact him should he wish to make additional purchases. Citizens and the building's owner had complained of activity suggesting a history of drug sales from the apartment. An officer testified that the day the warrant was executed the confidential informant called defendant at the number with which he had been provided during the earlier controlled buy and confirmed that defendant was in his apartment and willing to sell narcotics. It was reasonable to conclude that the probable cause that existed at the time the search warrant was issued continued to exist when the warrant was executed.</SPAN></P>

The petitioner's convictions were affirmed in June 1999, and, in July 2000, the district court filed an amended sentencing order adding a five-year conditional-release term to his sentence. The petitioner argued that his sentence was unconstitutional in light of recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, because the judge, rather than the jury, determined the existence of aggravating factors that resulted in the imposition of the 270-month sentence, rather than the presumptive guidelines sentence. The appellate court ruled that the petitioner's challenge to the constitutionality of his sentence based on the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in Apprendi, Ring, and Blakely failed because his case was final when those cases were decided; thus, his sentence was not affected by the new procedural rules that those cases established. Also, the five-year conditional-release term was appropriately added to the petitioner's sentence, because, when the petitioner was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, Minnesota law mandated the imposition of a conditional-release term.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a decision from the Mower County District Court (Minnesota), which dismissed a grand jury indictment charging defendant with violating laws prohibiting corporate campaign contributions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a grand jury returned an indictment for several election crimes, defendant filed a motion to dismiss. The district court dismissed the indictment after finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The State then sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the district court was permitted to dismiss the indictment under the conditions set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 630.18(4) (2002). The district court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.025 (2002) because the crimes were allegedly committed within Minnesota. Venue was proper in the county where the funds were derived under Minn. Stat. &sect; 627.01 (2002). As such, the court rejected defendant's challenges under Minn. Stat. &sect; 630.18(4) (2002) and Minn. R. Crim. P. 17.06, subd. 2. Further, the district court erred when it considered extrinsic evidence. The court rejected defendant's assertion that Minn. R. Crim. P. 11.03 applied since that rule only pertained to complaints. Finally, the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant committed violations of Minn. Stat. &sect; 211B.15, subd. 2 (2002) and Minn. Stat. &sect; 72A.12 (2002).</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction. The appellate court held that the officers did not manufacture a crime, but simply provided defendant with the opportunity to commit the crime; further the agent wore a cap identifying himself as a member of the compliance taskforce, and the checks were in response to the underage drinking problem in the county. The county was not prohibited from using underage officers in the compliance checks, as Minn.

The appellate court determined that a more severe penalty for possession of theft tools would reduce theft by reducing the ongoing occasion to engage in theft for those carrying the tools to accomplish it, this classification also met the requirements of equal protection under the Minnesota Constitution. There was sufficient evidence to support the conviction where the jury could reasonably conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant used a tool to execute the theft of the jacket. An upward departure under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095, subd. 4, required an admission or a jury verdict on the added finding that the convictions formed a pattern of criminal conduct. Because the district court determined that defendant's prior convictions formed a pattern of criminal conduct, his sentence was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court denied certification of defendant's assault charges and, following designation as an extended-juvenile-jurisdiction (EJJ) prosecution, a jury found him guilty of third-degree assault and not guilty of first-degree assault. On appeal from the third-degree assault conviction, he challenged in part the disposition that stayed an adult sentence. The court affirmed the rulings and instructions underlying the adjudication but, to comport with constitutional requirements, modified the disposition to vacate the stayed adult sentence. Because of the abundance of factual support in the record for the jury's verdict, the court rejected defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court did find, however, that Minn. Stat. &sect; 260B.130, subd. 4 (2002) was unconstitutional because, as written, the statute inevitably overweighed the prosecutor's discretion as an influence on the juvenile's sentence. That result, while clearly in violation of a juvenile's right to equal protection under law, appeared to have due process implications as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged the decision of the Anoka County District Court, Minnesota, denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus without an evidentiary hearing. He contended his right against self-incrimination was implicated when he was mandated by respondent, the Minnesota Commissioner of Corrections, to complete a Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP) while his conviction for failure to register as a sex offender was pending on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commissioner also determined that, if the inmate refused to complete a SOTP while his conviction for failure to register as a sex offender was pending on appeal, he would then be penalized by an extended period of incarceration of 150 days. The appellate court looked to a similar Kansas case, McKune v. Lile, where the United States Supreme Court heard a challenge to the Sexual Abuse Treatment Program (SATP) run by the Kansas Department of Corrections and considered how same affected an inmate's Fifth Amendment right. In the instant case, the appellate court held that, in light of the fact that a majority of the McKune court stated that extended incarceration constituted an unconstitutional compulsion, the inmate's allegations raised a factual dispute as to the implication of his privilege against self-incrimination by his participation in SOTP. Therefore, he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed the district court's denial of the inmate's motion to vacate the 150-day sentence and remanded the matter for an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which convicted him of attempted first-degree murder. Defendant contended that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence seized at the scene of the crime, abused its discretion by ruling that he could be impeached with his prior convictions, and erred by giving an unrequested instruction on his right not to testify.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Paramedics arrived on a scene where a victim was severely beaten. Believing defendant to also be injured, a paramedic pulled a wallet out his pocket and it was later discovered to be the victim's. Defendant was taken into custody and swabs of blood were retrieved from defendant's hands. The court held: (1) there was probable cause for defendant's arrest and the exigency of the circumstances justified obtaining evidence from defendant, such as the swabbings; (2) because defendant was lawfully arrested the wallet would inevitably have been discovered by the police; (3) the district court made extensive findings on each of the five factors set out in Jones, and because defendant's version of events was conveyed to the jury, defendant was not denied his right to testify by the ruling that he could be impeached with his prior convictions; and (4) the evidence against defendant was overwhelming and it could not be concluded that the adverse-inference instruction prejudiced defendant or that the error required a new trial. Because Blakely was decided while defendant's case was pending, the court remanded for consideration of defendant's sentence consistent with the holding of Blakely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant originally claimed his wife was injured in an auto accident but when the accident investigators confronted him with inconsistencies, he admitted that he had slammed her head against the inside of the car during an argument. Defendant challenged his conviction on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence and that second-degree felony murder was not a lesser-included offense of second-degree intentional murder. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, holding that felony murder was a lesser-included offense because both offenses required proof of the same elements except for the defendant's mental state, and proof of intent to kill necessarily proved malice. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in departing from the presumptive sentence of 150 months because the victim's vulnerability was listed as an aggravating factor under Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.D.2.b. The court noted that testimony established the wife's arm was in a sling due to recent surgery and she was unable to defend herself. Because the victim's vulnerability was sufficient to support the departure the court did not address the &quot;particular cruelty&quot; factor.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court ruled that the district court did not abuse its discretion by limiting the cross-examination of the victim. Defendant was not denied the right to question the victim about her condition, but only precluded from asking about whether she was on methadone treatment or taking Celexa. The district court permitted defendant to question the victim about her use of Neurontin and Ambien, and whether she experienced any dizziness on the day of the incident.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for aiding an offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.495, subd. 1 (2002) for driving three men who had been involved in a fatal shooting away from the scene. Defendant appealed, asserting the Redwood County District Court, Minnesota, erred in imposing a dispositional departure and a triple durational departure, based on its own findings, rather than those of a jury, in violation of her Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court noted it held in Hanf that dispositional departures that were based on broad offender characteristics were similar to the indeterminate sentencing decisions approved in Blakely, and therefore were not subject to Blakely's holding that the Sixth Amendment required a jury to make the findings supporting an increase in sentence. The district court's decision, based on defendant's lack of remorse and her failure in treatment, was the type of decision-making held in Hanf to be indeterminate in nature and therefore not subject to Blakely's holding. In the latter respect, defendant was properly sentenced to a dispositional departure based on the findings of the court rather than a jury. However, as to the triple durational departure, the trial court relied on aggravating factors such as the vulnerability of the shooting victims and whether they were treated with particular cruelty. That was conduct underlying the uncharged offense (in defendant's case) of second-degree murder for the victim who was killed. A departure for aiding an offender could not be based on conduct for said uncharged offense. Thus, imposition of the durational departure was error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and the dispositional departure were affirmed, but the triple durational departure imposed on defendant by the trial court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother moved to dismiss a petition brought by appellee county to terminate her parental rights (TPR), arguing that it was unfair for the county to proceed, having delayed until the children were not adoptable. The mother also argued that there was no evidence in the petition that a TPR served the children's best interests. The Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota) terminated her parental rights. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother first argued that the trial court erred in denying her motion to dismiss. The trial court denied the motion and ruled that the petition made a prima facie showing to support the statutory grounds pled and that it was unnecessary to make a prima facie showing that TPR was in the children's best interests. The court affirmed, stating that even if a best interests showing had been necessary the petition properly covered the issue by outlining the children's lengthy out-of-home placements and the mother's long history of noncompliance and unsuccessful programming. The mother also argued that the trial court erred when it accepted her limited waiver of trial rights. Although the mother was not questioned at length about her understanding of her trial rights, the five-day trial, where the parties called 10 witnesses and stipulated to almost 100 exhibits, provided an adequate forum for presentation of the mother's concern that the trial court consider long-term foster care. In addition, the trial court made detailed findings to support the conclusion that reasonable efforts had failed to correct the conditions leading to the children's out-of-home placements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's argument that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction failed, as appellant had not presented any evidence that indicated that the constitutional prerequisites to the enactment of Minn.

Because appellant was not charged with a crime and did not face the threat of incarceration, no right to counsel attached. Additionally, appellant's claim that the prosecutor did not disclose all trial witnesses lacked merit, as the prosecutor told appellant that the State intended to call two officers as witnesses at trial and gave appellant copies of the police reports written by the officers (which contained the work address of both officers). There was no basis for concluding that the prosecutor committed misconduct by failing to disclose the witnesses' addresses. Finally, as both officers testified that appellant was driving too fast for the icy conditions of the road and was not using due care, the court, as fact-finder, could reasonably conclude that appellant was guilty of the charged offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The secretary of state had previously notified the party that its candidates would not appear on the general election ballot because none of the candidates had received the minimum number of votes required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 204D.10, subd. 2 (Supp. 2003) in the primary election. On appeal, the party representatives argued if the primary threshold law was not repealed, its application to prevent the party candidates from appearing on the general election ballot was unconstitutional as a violation of their rights to associate for political purposes and to vote, as well as their rights to equal protection and due process. The supreme court weighed the burden the state's rule imposed on those rights against the interests the state contends justify that burden, and consider the extent to which the State's concerns make the burden necessary. The irrationality and arbitrariness of the primary threshold law were evident in several aspects of the statute's operation. In the absence of any suggested rational purpose for the law, the statute was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The secretary of state was ordered to certify the party's candidates.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the father of one of the owners purchased the property in question, the city council adopted a temporary moratorium on construction in a 100-year floodplain and the property was subject to the moratorium. The father transferred the property to the owners, who applied for a variance. The court affirmed the decision and held that the owners had the right to bring a takings claim for their property because the previous owners had not applied for a variance and a taking would not have occurred until administrative remedies had been exhausted. The court held that the district court erred in the application of the Statute of Frauds. Further, it was clear that a takings claim could pass with the property's title. However, the court found evidence that the owners' property had actually increased in value since they purchased it. Finally, while the subsequent ordinances passed by the city made it even tougher for the owners to obtain a building variance, the city did not make the subject property unbuildable. The court concluded that the property started out unbuildable. The city's actions did not deprive the owners of all economically beneficial or productive use of their property.</SPAN></P>

Under Section 8 Tenant Based Assistance, 24 C.F.R. &sect; 982.552(c)(i) (2004), the CDA could terminate the assistance of a program participant, if the family violated any family obligations under the program, and both of the latter matters constituted violations of the applicable regulations. The appellate court rejected the recipient's argument that any violation in failing to provide accurate information to the CDA was not serious enough to warrant termination of rent assistance, and found that, based on the record of the agency proceeding, particularly the testimony of the recipient, the additional person, and two related family members, the CDAs decision was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association promoted Christianity through a combination of live events, productions for film and television, and publication of books, pamphlets, and magazines. Its employees were required to profess Christianity and participate in devotional activities. The employee worked in the mailroom. Two employees reported seeing the employee kissing another woman in the parking lot at work. The employee admitted that she was a lesbian. Based on a determination that the employee's sexual orientation was inconsistent with the association's mission, the association terminated the employee's employment. The employee argued that because she was engaged in a secular business activity as a mailroom employee, the association was not exempt from the operation of the MHRA. The appellate court ruled that because the association's business activities were exclusively related to its evangelical ministry, they were not secular business activities unrelated to the religious and educational purposes for which the association was organized. The association was exempt under Minn. Stat. &sect; 363A.26(2) (Supp. 2003) from the sexual-orientation provisions of the MHRA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived with the victim and her two daughters in the victim's apartment. The victim testified that defendant attempted to force her into prostitution, threatened to kill her and her family members, held her hostage, and abused her repeatedly. Defendant argued that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence allegedly obtained through an illegal search. Defendant conceded that the victim had authority to consent to a search of the apartment, actually consented, and that the victim entered the apartment with the police after defendant had been arrested. The appellate court ruled that defendant's consent to the search was irrelevant, and the district court did not err in ruling that the evidence was admissible because it was obtained from a lawful search. Also, the appellate court determined that the upward durational departure sentence for first-degree criminal sexual conduct should be remanded. If a recent U.S. Supreme Court case applied to the Minnesota sentencing guidelines, defendant would be entitled to the benefit of the rule established in that case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court noted that the purpose of Minn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 17 was to prevent fraud or surprise in the legislative process by ensuring that the public had notice of the bill's contents. The court held that the district court properly denied the inmate's claim for postconviction relief and that both Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.342, subd. 1(a) and 609.343, subd. 1(a) (2002) had similar titles, and given that the titles provided a plain description of their respective acts, the titles provided reasonable notice of the acts' contents. The inmate also argued that the two provisions did not contain an enactment clause required by Minn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. The court held that copies of Minnesota statutes did not need to contain the enactment clauses of the statutes contained therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender argued that his commitment without a jury trial violated his constitutional rights and that the provisions of the SPP and SDP statute,&nbsp;Minn.

The court noted that the civil commitment act had withstood constitutional challenges identical to those made by the offender. Neither the state constitution nor federal due process required a jury trial before a person was committed as a SPP or SDP under state law. Furthermore, by failing to identify any constitutional defects in the statutory provisions or in their application to him, the offender had not met his burden of proof. The offender met the criteria for commitment as a SPP and a SDP, Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02 (2002). Experts testified that their opinions were based on the use of actuarial tests, interviews, and a review of pertinent records and that the offender was only partially treated. They also testified that they had weighed the offender's amenability to continued treatment and his family support, but nevertheless concluded that he was utterly unable to control his sexual conduct and remained highly likely to re-offend sexually.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), contesting the validity of his conviction for kidnapping, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.25, subds. 1(2), 2(2) (1998). He had also been convicted of attempted first-degree criminal sexual conduct and second-degree criminal sexual conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the kidnapping was merely incidental to the sexual assault and attempted sexual assault against the victim. Defendant confined or removed the victim twice, once inside a restroom stall and again when he forced her into his car. In affirming defendant's kidnapping conviction, the court held that, aside from the fact that a sexual assault could be committed in a space less confining than a restroom stall, defendant's conduct in pulling the victim back into the stall when she tried to escape went beyond the force or coercion required for criminal sexual conduct. Thus, the confinement in the stall was not merely incidental to commission of criminal sexual conduct. Defendant claimed that his upward sentencing departure for the kidnapping violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under the United States Supreme Court's Blakely decision. The court found that, even if it were to conclude that Blakely applied to the Minnesota sentencing guidelines, it would still be necessary to determine what was the appropriate remedy. The court stated that the trial court was in the best position to resolve those issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's kidnapping conviction, but remanded his kidnapping sentence for consideration of the possible application of Blakely to the sentence, and for determination of the appropriate remedy if Blakely applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the company's stores allowed a package of cigarettes to be purchased with a WIC voucher. The Department found that the inclusion of the cigarettes on the voucher was entirely inadvertent, but disqualified the company from the WIC program for three years under state and federal regulations that mandated such disqualification for even one instance of the sale of tobacco products in exchange for a WIC voucher. The appellate court ruled that the evidence and the law supported the conclusion that a violation occurred, and the department's regulations did not arbitrarily and capriciously sanction unintentional rule violations. 7 C.F.R. &sect; 246.12(l)(1)(iii)(A) required a state agency to disqualify a vendor for three years for one incidence of the sale of alcohol or tobacco products in exchange for a food instrument, thus the company's three-year disqualification was not unwarranted in law. Since the company conceded that it exchanged a pack of cigarettes for a WIC voucher, the disqualification was also not without justification in fact. The sanction, although harsh, was not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for an improper lane change, and the officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol. The officer observed that defendant had slurred speech and bloodshot, watery eyes. The officer asked defendant to perform several field sobriety tests, and, based on defendant's performance, the officer believed that defendant was under the influence of alcohol and placed her under arrest for DWI. The officer administered the Intoxilyzer test, which produced an alcohol concentration reading of .14. The appellate court ruled that a jury could have reasonably found defendant guilty of testing .10 or more within two hours of driving and driving under the influence of alcohol. The officer testified that defendant gave two adequate breath samples and that the machine performed a calibration standard analysis between each sample. Also, the admission of the Intoxilyzer test, without antecedent expert testimony as to the test method, did not create an unconstitutional presumption of guilt, despite the jury instruction that the jury must evaluate both the reliability of the test method and the reliability of the test result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a passenger in a car that was stopped for speeding. An officer knew defendant from prior contact and knew he had been present during the execution of a search warrant at an active methamphetamine lab two days prior to the stop. While the driver, who was suspected of being under the influence of a controlled substance, was being processed for the stop, a narcotics detection dog was brought to the scene. When the dog alerted to the presence of drugs, the passengers were removed from the car. Defendant was leasing the car, and signed a consent form to search the car. The officers searched the trunk and found stolen tools. The appellate court ruled that the district court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppression. Because the driver was speeding, displayed behavior consistent with a person under the influence, and an officer recognized defendant as being involved with illegal narcotics activity, the police were within legal authority to seize the driver and conduct a dog sniff. The officers had probable cause to search the car, as the dog alerted to the presence of narcotics, and another passenger produced drugs and a pipe.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the city based its decision on a 182-page report, transcripts from various meetings, supplemental reports, and presentations from the opposing sides. Thus, the parameters were not arbitrary and capricious because the city did not act on a whim and the record contained articulated reasons for the parameters of the historic designation and significant period. Further, the district was a defined area because of historical significance and was not an arbitrary designation simply because the properties were non-contiguous. The city's reasons for the historic designation had a factual basis that was supplied either by the initial report or the supplemental report, which was prepared following extensive questions and comments at the public hearing. Thus, similarly situated properties were not treated differently within the parameters of the study.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and that the statute under which he was convicted was void. The appellate court found no constitutional deficiency in defendant's convictions. Defendant argued that his convictions violated the state constitution and were therefore void. Defendant was convicted of first- and second-degree criminal sexual conduct in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.342, subd. 1(a), .343, subd. 1(g) (1994). At the time of his conviction, both Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.342 and Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.343 were compiled from portions of 10 legislative enactments. Each of the acts creating and amending the statutes, as published in the Laws of Minnesota, began with the precise phrase, &quot;Be it enacted by the legislature of the state of Minnesota.&quot; Therefore, defendant's conviction was not void because the statutes under which he was convicted complied with the constitutional mandates of Minn. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22. His argument also confused the laws of Minnesota with the codified statutes. There was no constitutional deficiency in the district court's jurisdiction and the judge was legally qualified to rule on the merits of the instant case.</SPAN></P>

The officer knew defendant and that he had a history of drug use. The intersection was known for drug activity, and, after defendant observed the squad car, he turned and walked away.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners argued that the ordinance was preempted by state law and that the statute violated the Due Process Clauses of the state and federal constitutions. In affirming, the court held that the doctrine of preemption did not preclude the county from regulating the owners' ISTS through its own ordinance because Minn. Stat. &sect; 115.55, subds. 5, 5a (2002) expressly provided for local regulation. The owners failed to present a justiciable controversy on whether &sect; 115.55, subds. 5, 5a, violated separation of powers by vesting quasi-judicial authority in licensed ISTS inspectors without a mechanism for judicial review. Section 115.55, subd. 5a did not violate due process by creating an irrebuttable presumption because it allowed for a meaningful opportunity to be heard and to dispute an inspector's finding of an imminent threat to public health or safety. Because the owners failed to demonstrate that Minn. R. 7080.0060, subtp. 3 (2003), which relied on the definitions in Minn. R. 7080.0020, subpts. 28e, 29a, 49b (2003) and the criteria in Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two officers were patrolling in the vicinity where defendant was stopped.

At about the time defendant came by, the first officer clarified that defendant's pickup was actually a mid-sized pickup, and he described it as to its model. The second officer then stopped defendant's pickup. Defendant argued that, because the snowstorm made visibility difficult and there were many pickup trucks in the subject town, there was not a reasonable objective basis for the stop. However, the appellate court noted the second officer observed that defendant's vehicle was travelling much faster than the smaller vehicle and there were no ingress or egress routes between the two points where either officer observed defendant's vehicle. Thus, additional pickup trucks entering onto the highway would have been unlikely. The appellate court held the second officer was entitled to act on the first officer's tip, and that, based on the totality of the circumstances, the second officer had a particularized and objective basis for making the stop.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court disagreed, holding that, while there was conflicting testimony, the trial court heard both parties and found the officer's version of events to be more credible. The trial court did not, therefore, err by concluding that the officer had reasonable, articulable suspicion sufficient to stop defendant, and it did not err by denying his motion to suppress evidence resulting from the stop. Further, it was not error for the trial court to prevent the jury from playing the dispatch tape in the jury room; instead the jury was required to listen to the tape again only after reconvening in the courtroom with the parties present, which was the preferable method. The jury could have believed the officers' testimony rather than defendant's and found that there was aggression or provocation by defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer argued that the assessment exceeded the benefit to the property and that the assessment was not uniform on the same class of property. The court held that the testimony of the developer's president failed to rebut the presumption of validity created by the city's approval of its assessment roll because he only testified in general terms. While the city was allowed discretion to determine categories of property benefited by improvements, under Winona, Minn., Ordinance 3481, it had to allocate the cost of the improvement to the gross developable acreage benefited. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the city failed to comply with the ordinance in making that allocation because the city did not determine the extent of the property that benefited from the construction of the smaller diameter trunk lines, as required by the ordinance. When considering a challenge to a city's assessment, the trial court had authority to order a reassessment of all the property on the roll if the challenge involved the validity of an entire assessment, which it had in the developer's case. Thus, the trial court properly ordered reassessment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Dakota County District Court (Minnesota), which denied his petitions for postconviction relief. Defendant had been convicted of four counts of harassment and one count of impersonating a police officer. The trial court found that he was a dangerous repeat offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1095 (2000) and sentenced him to an executed, upward double departure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was entitled to relief on various grounds, including a claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. In affirming, the court held that all of defendant's claims were either previously raised by him in his direct appeal or known to him at that time. Thus, they could not be considered in a subsequent postconviction relief proceeding. Defendant made no claim, and the record did not indicate, that the three enumerated exceptions to the general rule that matters raised or known to defendant at the time of direct appeal were barred from consideration of postconviction relief applied. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's petition that challenged his sentence without an evidentiary hearing. The court concluded that defendant did not meet his burden of proving ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. He failed to provide a credible argument as to why his attorney should have raised the claim that Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.749 (2000), the statute under which he was convicted, was vague and overbroad and also failed to show that, but for the alleged errors, the results of his case would have been different.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a search warrant was executed, defendant was arrested and charged with multiple violations of controlled-substance laws. In response to defendant's argument that the warrant was invalid, the Dakota County District Court, Minnesota, concluded that the unannounced entry was justified by the information contained in the supporting affidavit for the warrant and that application of the exclusionary rule was not appropriate. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the trial court erred: in determining that reasonable suspicion existed to justify an unannounced entry into the apartment; and in determining that the exclusionary rule should not apply to evidence seized by police when the warrant was executed one minute and seven seconds before the permitted time frame. The appellate court disagreed, finding that a reasonable suspicion that the safety of the officers would have been threatened if the unannounced-entry provision was not part of the warrant based on information in the affidavit stating that the person who lived in the apartment was engaged in drug sales, was involved in a gang, and frequently carried a gun. The appellate court also concluded that the warrant, executed less than two minutes before the applicable time for the commencement of the search, did not constitute a constitutional violation. It was unlikely such a de minimis departure from the statutory requirement would have be so unexpected so as to cause a surprise intrusion into defendant's privacy beyond the invasion that would have occurred if the search was properly executed one minute and seven seconds later.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant abducted the victim from a bus stop and sexually assaulted her. The victim, a diabetic, had been on her way to a medical facility for treatment at the time of the offense. The court found no error in the district court's admission, under Minn. R. Evid. 609(a)(1), of defendant's prior conviction for first-degree assault. Although somewhat remote, the prior conviction demonstrated significant disregard for the law and thus was probative of truthfulness. Because of the victim's medical condition, describing her as a vulnerable adult was not prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor drew reasonable inferences from the DNA evidence introduced at trial. The prosecutor improperly appealed to prejudice by inviting the jury to consider the crime's impact on the community and by eliciting sympathy for the victim, but those errors were harmless. Although the district court had permissive authority under Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.F to impose consecutive sentences and did so based on a finding of particular cruelty under Minn. Sentencing Guidelines II.D.2.b(2), the court remanded, because the district court found aggravating factors under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and remanded for consideration of whether the upward departure was unconstitutional in light of recent federal case law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was shot during a robbery attempt. The victim selected defendant's photo from a photographic lineup and said that he was 85 percent sure that defendant was the shooter. Police then showed the victim a profile photograph of defendant, and the victim identified defendant as the shooter. Because the victim selected defendant from the lineup with a significant degree of certainty, the court concluded that showing the second photograph was not impermissibly suggestive. Although police informed the victim about defendant's confession after the victim identified him as the shooter, the in-court identification was not tainted. Defendant's due process rights were not violated, because the identification procedures did not cause a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. Defendant was not entitled to a mistrial regarding the admission of evidence about a prior conviction, because defendant did not stipulate that he was ineligible to possess a firearm. Moreover, any instructional error was harmless, as the district court gave a curative instruction. Counsel's failure to stipulate that defendant was ineligible to possess a firearm was not ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the extension of the statute of limitations after his offenses were committed was an unconstitutional ex post facto law. He further contended that the upward durational sentence imposed by the trial court was error. The appellate court noted that because the statute of limitations had not yet expired on defendant's 1993 offense, an amendment extended the statute of limitations on that offense to nine years; therefore, under the new amendment, defendant had to be charged with the offense no later than November 11, 2002. The appellate court found that because defendant was charged on October 22, 2002, the statute of limitations had not yet expired, and because the 1995 extension of the statute of limitations occurred before the 1993 statute of limitations had expired, it survived his ex post facto challenge. However, the appellate court held that an upward departure under Washington's determinate sentencing scheme was found by the United States Supreme Court to have violated a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial; thus, the trial court had to consider that precedent in resentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, manufacturers and distributors of cigarettes who were not parties to State v. Philip Morris, Inc., which ended in a settlement agreement, brought an action against appellee State to prohibit enforcement of Minn. Stat. &sect; 297F.24 (Supp. 2003), alleging that the statute violated, inter alia, the First Amendment. The Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) granted summary judgment to the State. The manufacturers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first issue was whether Minn. Stat. &sect; 297F.24 (Supp. 2003) abridged the manufacturers' First Amendment right of free speech. The purpose of &sect; 297F.24, was to require non-settlement manufacturers to pay fees comparable to the costs incurred by the State attributable to the use of cigarettes and to prevent non-settlement manufacturers from flooding the State with cheap cigarettes, thereby undermining the State's policy of discouraging youth smokers. The Court of Appeals of Minnesota held that was a legitimate purpose within the State's power and, because it was not a direct attempt to regulate speech, did not offend the First Amendment. The classifications in the statute between settling manufacturers, who paid annual fees that subsidized the costs to the state of smoking and acted to raise cigarette prices to discourage youthful smokers, and non-settling manufacturers, who did not, created a genuine and substantial distinction tied to a legitimate state interest. As such, Minn. Stat. &sect; 297F.24 was not special legislation prohibited by the Minnesota Constitution. Section 297F.24 (Supp. 2003) was not a direct attempt to regulate speech but had a legitimate legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the complainant began dating, and defendant moved into the complainant's residence. Defendant did not deny choking the complainant with a chain. Defendant said he wanted to talk to the complainant that morning, he was &quot;ashamed&quot; that the complainant wanted him to leave, and then his &quot;whole body felt like it left.&quot; During this out-of-body experience, defendant choked the complainant with a chain. The appellate court ruled that no rational basis existed for the jury to convict defendant of fifth-degree assault, a lesser-included offense of second-degree assault, and acquit him of second-degree assault. Defendant choked the complainant with a chain, chain marks remained visible on the complainant's neck for several days after the assault, and she temporarily lost her voice. The chain was clearly used in a manner calculated to cause bodily harm. However, the case would have to be remanded for resentencing, because the district court imposed a double durational departure on its own findings that the victim was particularly vulnerable, the offense was done in a particularly cruel way, and the crime was committed in the presence of children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to charges of first- and second-degree burglary in the Kanabec County District Court, Minnesota. Per a plea agreement, the trial court stayed execution of defendant's sentence and granted his request for probation with the requirement that he complete a drug-and-alcohol treatment program. Defendant failed to complete the program, and the trial court later revoked his probation and imposed his sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record established that defendant was discharged from the treatment program because of hostile conduct directed at staff members, including repeated threats to sue the sponsors of the treatment program. The district court was required to address three factors when revoking a defendant's probation. The district court did not explicitly address the three factors. However, because defendant did not assert at the probation-revocation hearing that said factors had not been satisfied, the appellate court could affirm the revocation of his probation if there was sufficient record evidence to show that those factors were met. Only the third factor was at issue. That was, that the need for confinement outweighed the policies favoring probation. Defendant's probation officer had recommended that his sentence be imposed, because he &quot;seemed to be a huge risk to public safety.&quot; Defendant himself impliedly admitted that his behavior in the treatment program was improper. Further, the record also showed that the seriousness of his probation violation would have been unduly depreciated if his probation had not been revoked. Thus, the trial court properly revoked defendant's probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, revoking defendant's probation and executing his sentence, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Minnesota Commissioner of Commerce, notified relator life insurance company (the company) that it intended to disallow the company's credit insurance rates. The company moved for summary disposition. Following a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) denied the company's motion and recommended disallowing the rates. The recommendation was adopted, and the company sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was undisputed that the rates were within the prima facie range established by law and were therefore presumptively reasonable. However, under Minn. Stat. 62B.07, subd. 2 (2002), even when rates met the latter standard, the Commissioner had to disapprove an insurance form if the premium rates were excessive in relation to benefits. The company paid out in claims only 20 percent of the amount collected for credit life insurance and 18 percent of the amount collected for credit disability insurance. An actuary testified that the company's extremely high commission rates were excessive in comparison to commissions that were paid in other states for similar policies. Specifically, the company paid 53 percent of the credit life insurance premiums and 50 percent of the credit disability premiums for commissions to agents. Consequently, the appellate court found the agency's conclusions were not arbitrary and capricious. The appellate court found the Commissioner successfully rebutted the presumption of reasonableness of the company's rates and rejected the company's argument that the Commissioner engaged in unpromulgated rulemaking by its disapproval.</SPAN></P>

He said only that he &quot;didn't like the way that my case was being represented at this point in time, and I do not feel comfortable with the situation.&quot; Defendant argued that his uneasiness was delayed because he did not have extensive contact with his attorneys until just prior to trial. But there was nothing in the record to support that claim or to explain what made defendant &quot;uneasy&quot; other than his statement that he did not believe that his attorneys were representing him to the best of their ability. Because defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by his attorneys' representation, and the motion for continuance was untimely, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for a continuance to obtain private counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court further found no merit to defendant's contention that all evidence relating to the show-up identification should have been suppressed. The victim's consistent testimony both before and after the show-up indicated that the procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive. Though the victim was unable to view the perpetrator's face, she was able to ascertain his race, gender, stature, hand size, and clothing at the time of the crime. Finally, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the perpetrator of the crime.

Stat. &sect; 16A.152, subd. 4 (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The finance commissioner reduced a mineral fund in response to a state deficit under the provisions of Minn. Stat. &sect; 16A.152, subd. 4 (2002). Thereafter, the taxpayers, the legislators, and the association challenged the action. The district court granted summary judgment after finding that there was no standing to proceed with the action. On review, the court determined that the taxpayers lacked standing because the challenges were primarily based on their disagreement with the policy or exercise of discretion by those responsible for executing the law. Further, the legislators did not have standing because they did not show any injury that was other than an institutional one. However, the association had standing because of its mission to promote economic development in mining regions. However, summary judgment was properly granted because the finance commissioner had authority under &sect; 16A.152, subd. 4 to reduce the mineral fund to meet the budget shortfall. Money in the mineral fund at the time of the reduction was not &quot;expended&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 16A.152, subd. 4(b). Finally, &sect; 16A.152 did not unconstitutionally violate the separation-of-powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Sections 611A.31-611A.375 established grants of appropriated funds to local programs to provide services for victims of domestic abuse.

The citizens claimed that they had standing based upon their status as residents and taxpayers of Minnesota.

The court found that, upon first spotting the officers, defendant began walking away from them. He reversed his direction once the officers were out of sight and moved in the same direction they had gone, only to reverse his course again and move more quickly once he saw that the officers were returning. The fact that defendant's behavior could reasonably be construed by the officers as an attempt to evade them gave the officers reasonable suspicion to stop defendant without more. The court further found that defendant was involved in a disturbance in a high-crime area. More importantly, defendant, who appeared to the officers to be in his late teens, appeared to be carrying a concealed weapon, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.714, subd. 2(b)(2) (Supp. 2003). Accordingly, the officers had a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity to stop defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and the boy were looking at a computer, and police found two photographs of juvenile males in defendant's wallet when he was arrested. The warrant affidavit also outlined the officers' combined training and experience of more than 15 years in sex crimes investigations. Therefore, the search warrant was supported by probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1996, defendant was convicted of first-degree burglary. Defendant brought a second petition for postconviction relief challenging his conviction. The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, denied his petition. Defendant appealed, challenging whether he was mentally competent to assist in his defense and whether the warrantless search of his car was lawful. Defendant also asserted several other errors as to his trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised claims that could have been raised in his first postconviction proceeding, and those claims were waived. However, the appellate court chose to address certain claims in the interests of justice. Defendant argued that the prosecutor committed misconduct by commenting at the Rasmussen hearing on his decision to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege and not answer a question about his prior knowledge of stolen property in the trunk of his vehicle. The prosecutor had argued that the trial court should have drawn adverse conclusions from defendant's invocation of his Fifth Amendment right. However, the next day, the prosecutor corrected the error on the record and made sure that defendant understood that his testimony during the Rasmussen hearing could not be used against him in the case in chief other than for impeachment purposes. The appellate court held that, as the comment was made to the trial court, not a jury, there was no prosecutorial misconduct. Finally, the appellate court rejected defendant's argument that he was improperly sentenced as a career-offender. Defendant had five prior felony convictions, which sufficed for his sentence as a career offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators, a racehorse owner and his trainer, appealed an order of respondent, Minnesota Racing Commission, which affirmed the board of stewards' 30-day suspension of the trainer because of a positive finding of albuterol in a urine sample taken from a horse he trained after the horse won a race, which affirmed the disqualification of the horse, and which required the owner to return and redistribute the purse money.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators argued that the commission's ruling violated their due-process rights and that the rules on which the suspension and redistribution order were based were invalid. In affirming, the court found that the trainer had proper notice of the proceedings before the board, as he had been notified via telephone and had been present at the hearing via telephone. Under Minn. R. 7877.0170, subpt. 2J, because the trainer had notice of the proceedings, the owner was also deemed to have notice of the proceedings. Moreover, the owner was sent a notice of the hearing. Accordingly, relators were not deprived of due process of law. Relators failed to show that Minn. R. 7877.0170, subpt. 2C, was unconstitutional, as ensuring the integrity of horse racing in Minnesota was a legitimate public purpose, and the rule was rationally related to achieving that public purpose. The commission's decision was justified, because the fact that the horse tested positive for albuterol was prima facie evidence that the trainer was responsible for the drug's presence in the horse's system under Minn. R. 7890.0130 (2003). The return of the purse money was not a fine or penalty under the Commission's rules.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Commission's order.</SPAN></P>

The patient did not articulate any legal argument why authorizing medication in emergencies violated her rights. Evidence that the patient had not eaten for two days prior to her hospitalization, failed to take her prescribed neuroleptic medications, refused to let a doctor examine her ankle, which had been in a cast for nearly eight months, threatened to commit suicide by jumping out of her apartment window, and kicked a nurse in the chest, lunged at another nurse, and acted aggressively toward other hospital staff was sufficient to find that she was mentally ill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants claimed that their failure to obtain a license and sale of custom-processed meat were exempt from prosecution. The court held that defendants' failure to obtain a license was not protected by Minn. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 7 because they were not &quot;peddlers&quot; engaged in house-to-house vending, but instead made sales at a fixed location on a regular basis. The court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 28A.15, subds. 1-2 were not applicable because the phrase &quot;products of a farm or garden occupied and cultivated&quot; did not include the sale of meat, and the exclusion applied to persons not regularly engaged in the business. The court held that the exemption from inspections provided in Minn. Stat. &sect; 31A.15, subd. 1(1) did not apply because defendants did not process their own meat and did not restrict its use to household members, nonpaying guests, and employees. The court noted that &sect; 31A.15, subd. 1(4) specifically prohibited the sale of custom-processed meat. The court held that both Acts were constitutional because they were a reasonable exercise of the state's police powers that restricted the manner in which farmers could bring meat to market, but did not impinge on any fundamental right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State charged defendant with conspiracy to procure unlawful voting and conspiracy to commit forgery. The Dakota County District Court (Minnesota) denied defendant's motion to dismiss and later granted the State's motion to suppress evidence relevant to defendant's defense that he relied on the advice of counsel and on an official interpretation of the law. At defendant's request, the district court certified two questions to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly solicited people to fill out, sign, and file voter-registration cards falsely listing defendant's adult men's club as the voter's place of residence. The district court certified the questions of whether the defenses of reliance on advice of counsel and on an official interpretation were available to defendant under Minnesota law and whether the defenses were available to defendant, as a matter of law, given the district court's finding that any reliance was unreasonable. The court held that good-faith reliance on the advice of counsel and/or on an official interpretation of the law was an available defense when intent was an element of the charged crime. Thus, the attorney's advice, if in good faith, was relevant on the issue of intent to conspire. Additionally, the district court erred in concluding that any reliance by defendant on his attorney's advice was unreasonable as a matter of law. The district court had to wait for the substance of defendant's attorney's advice to be disclosed before making a determination as to relevancy. The court also stated that evidence of reliance was admissible as a part of defendant's due process right to explain his conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction of first-degree controlled substance crime, arguing that the district court erred by not warning him of the dangers of joint representation, by admitting evidence seized in the course of his arrest, and by failing to effectively remedy the State's failure to disclose that a witness was a confidential reliable informant. The court affirmed however, stating that he was not denied effective assistance of counsel because his defense attorney represented both him and his co-defendant, Minn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6. Defendant's allegations of conflict failed to provide even informed speculation that he was prejudiced. The record showed that defendant and the co-defendant did not have any antagonistic defenses or interests. In addition, the large amount of cash found on defendant at the time of his arrest, and the testimony of witnesses provided strong evidence of defendant's guilt. The information provided by the confidential reliable informant and corroborated by law enforcement officials provided probable cause to arrest defendant and a discovery violation was not prejudicial in light of remedial measure taken by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petitioner pled guilty to third-degree assault. Nearly two years later, the petitioner was charged in federal court with distributing cocaine and pled guilty. Based on the petitioner's criminal-history score, the federal court sentenced him to serve 108 months in prison. The petitioner subsequently moved to challenge the validity of his third-degree assault conviction. The petitioner argued that his plea was not voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, because he was not advised by the district court or defense counsel that his conviction could be used to enhance a subsequent sentence in federal court. The appellate court ruled that the district court properly advised the petitioner of his constitutional rights and the direct consequences of his guilty plea. Also, the plea petition and the petitioner's statements at the guilty-plea hearing clearly established that he was advised of the direct consequences of his plea. The enhancement effect of the petitioner's plea was a collateral consequence of the plea, about which defense counsel, like the district court, was not obligated to advise.</SPAN></P>

R. Evid. 404(b). Evidence indicated defendant drove the vehicles in Minnesota; he was not an Oregon resident. He could not have legally driven the vehicles in Minnesota unless they were registered. From the Oregon vehicle registration forms, the jury could have inferred he licensed the vehicles in Oregon so he could obtain license plates while avoiding Minnesota tax. The Oregon vehicle registration application was relevant to establish the charged offense, and the trial court properly admitted the evidence. The military travel vouchers were also properly admitted. A necessary element of the crimes was that defendant was a resident of Minnesota. To prove he was a resident, it was necessary for the State to prove he was either domiciled in Minnesota, or domiciled outside Minnesota while maintaining a place of abode in the state and spending more than half the tax year in Minnesota. Error, if any, caused by statements the State made during closing argument on the travel vouchers was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court, St. Louis County, Minnesota, convicted defendant of first-degree test refusal and first-degree DWI and sentenced him to the presumptive maximum, a 75-month executed sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the enhancement statute prevented &quot;meaningful review,&quot; because the enhancement of the criminal DWI penalty was based on a civil procedure that did not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The court disagreed and held that reliance on defendant's prior license revocation to enhance the DWI charge was not a due process violation. As determined in recent case law, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169A.53 (2002) provided for the required &quot;meaningful judicial review,&quot; as it allowed for a separate judicial review, as well as administrative review, of a revocation. The court also found no error in the trial court's refusal to depart from the presumptive sentence. Defendant argued that, because he had a drinking problem, treatment would be more appropriate than the 75-month sentence. The court noted that there was little doubt that defendant had an alcohol problem, but he also had a long criminal history. At the sentencing hearing, 43 past convictions were noted; nine for felonies and nine for controlled substance or DWI offenses. The district court stated that it might have considered probation if defendant had demonstrated any ability to remain on probation or to remain sober.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, challenged a decision from the Hennepin County District Court (Minnesota), which adjudicated him delinquent for the crime of possession of a pistol by minor, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.713, subd. 1(a) (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two police officers saw defendant drop an object as they drove by. When the object hit the ground, it sounded like metal. Defendant was stopped and questioned by the officers, and a search of the area uncovered a pistol. Defendant was then charged with a weapon offense. After he was adjudicated delinquent, defendant sought review. On appeal, the court determined that defendant waived his right to challenge the admissibility of the pistol, and addressing the issue would have worked an &quot;unfair surprise&quot; on the State since the record was not adequately developed. However, the court noted that the pistol would have been admissible under search and seizure law. The officers properly conducted an investigatory stop because they articulated a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Further, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction, despite the fact that it was based on circumstantial evidence. The evidence introduced formed a complete chain that led directly to defendant's guilt. The district court was entitled to discredit defendant's testimony. However, the district court's failure to make the written findings constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the disposition based on a failure to make sufficient written findings. The case was reversed with directions to make the appropriate findings. The rest of the district court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that there was no evidence to support the proposition that a person in possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms was similarly situated to a person in possession of marijuana. Defendant did not show Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.022 prescribed different punishments or different degrees of punishment for the same conduct committed under the same circumstances by persons similarly situated. Defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied, as the fact that the warrant application did not describe every controlled substance the drug dog was certified to detect did not demonstrate that the officer acted intentionally or recklessly. Defendant agreed to a court trial pursuant to the procedures set out in a prior case. He forfeited any right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of DWI in Minnesota in 1994 and 2001, and his driver's license was revoked for both offenses. Defendant did not challenge the use of these convictions as aggravating factors, but he challenged the use of his DWI conviction and license revocation in Colorado in 1995 as aggravating factors as applied to the current charges. Concerning the right to consult with an attorney before deciding whether to submit to blood-alcohol testing, the appellate court determined that it was clear that the Colorado law regarding pre-test right to counsel was not in accord with the Minnesota Constitution, and the denial of assistance of counsel to defendant in Colorado violated the Minnesota Constitution, Minn. Const. I, &sect; 6. Under Colorado law, a driver had no right to confer with counsel before deciding whether to consent to chemical testing, and, in Minnesota, a driver had a limited right to consult with an attorney. Because defendant's prior Colorado license revocation resulted from an uncounseled chemical test, it violated his Minnesota constitutional rights and could not be used to enhance defendant's current Minnesota offenses.</SPAN></P>

She testified that she smoked two to three marijuana cigarettes a day, and that the marijuana stopped her nausea and gave her an appetite. She testified that the marijuana also stopped her muscle spasms. Defendant argued, inter alia, that her conviction violated her rights to freedom of conscience. The court of appeals disagreed. Defendant failed to provide any evidence that established a connection between the practice of her religion and the medicinal use of marijuana. Her belief in the medicinal use of marijuana was a personal, secular belief, driven more by her medical needs than any philosophical principle or religious tenet. The marijuana provided defendant with significant relief from her illness, but that therapeutic effect was not religious. Therefore, defendant's medicinal use of marijuana was not a sincerely held religious belief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the Scott County District Court, Minnesota, defendant was convicted of two counts of second-degree driving while impaired (DWI), which required the existence of an aggravating factor. As part of his omnibus motions, he had moved to dismiss the charges on the grounds that his 1994 license revocation could not be used as an aggravating factor to enhance the charges. The trial court had denied the motion. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his 1994 license revocation should not have been used for enhancement purposes, because he was not given an opportunity to contest the revocation when his attorney in 1994 failed to file a timely implied consent petition. However, no Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached to implied consent proceedings. Therefore, the failure of defendant's attorney to have filed a timely implied consent petition in 1994 did not violate his constitutional right to counsel. Defendant also argued that his 1994 license revocation was an unconstitutional seizure, because two recent affidavits signed by him indicated that he was not driving the vehicle during the 1994 incident. However, there was no legal provision allowing defendant to perfect a collateral attack on his 1994 license revocation almost 10 years later by the simple expedient of showing the appellate court his own affidavits prepared in 2003 that addressed his theory of why a jury found him not guilty of DWI in 1994. Because the record did not indicate that defendant's 1994 license revocation was unconstitutional, the 1994 revocation was properly used to enhance his DWI charges in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the husband claimed that the financial obligations imposed by the trial court exceeded his ability to pay, that the trial judge erred in not ordering joint physical custody, and that the trial judge was biased and should have recused himself from the matter. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The appellate court noted that as the husband was an ophthalmologist who only worked three days a week, the trial court did not err in imputing income to the husband for the purposes of child support and maintenance. The appellate court also held that that the trial court did not err in refusing to order joint custody, as joint physical custody was disfavored in Minnesota. The trial court did not err in its distribution of the property as the husband failed to trace his nonmarital interest in the piano and the residence. Finally, the husband failed to prove that the judge was biased and should have been removed as the husband failed to raise the issue at the trial level, and the husband failed to show evidence of bias. Although the trial judge did tell the husband to &quot;shut up,&quot; it was only after the husband had repeatedly interrupted during a proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to suppress evidence discovered in the search of his boat. The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, granted the motion, and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A sheriff's deputy was performing water patrol and observed defendant's boat fail to yield to the deputy's boat, and almost cause a collision. After going by the patrol boat, defendant (who was driving) got off the boat and started heading toward the marina. He complied with the deputy's request to come back to the dock. The boat was searched, and the search revealed there was no fire extinguisher or life preservers on board. Defendant moved to suppress the search of the boat. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's grant of the motion. The appellate court noted that as defendant was only being arrested for a misdemeanor, the State could not rely on the search-incident-to-a-lawful-arrest exception to search the boat as under Minn. R. Crim. P. 6.01, subd. 1(1)(a), a search could only be initiated after an arrest for a misdemeanor if it reasonably appeared to the officer that arrest or detention was necessary to prevent bodily harm to the accused or another or further criminal conduct, or that there was a substantial likelihood that the accused will fail to respond to a citation. As there was no evidence supporting a custodial arrest, the search of the boat was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

However, judicial notice was appropriate based on the testing of the laser device and the training of the officer. Also, Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.14, subd. 10(a), (b) (2002) did not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine because it did not conflict with the Minnesota Rules of Evidence. Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the laser reading to establish defendant's speed because the officer was trained, and the device had been routinely tested for accuracy. A certificate of testing and accuracy was admissible under Minn. R. Evid. 803(6) because the certificate was reliable, and it was not prepared solely for litigation purposes. Finally, the officer's visual estimate of speed was alone sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals agreed. Police responded to a domestic dispute between an intoxicated female and an intoxicated male. They arrived shortly after the 911 call. An officer sighted a vehicle on the left of the parking area, about 50 feet away from the townhouse where the call had originated. She shined her flashlight on the car and observed one occupant, and saw no other activity in the area. The car was the only occupied car in the parking area. As the officer continued toward the car, it began to move forward. The officer believed that the driver was possibly the male involved in the domestic altercation and told him to stop. The officer asked the driver where he had come from. The driver pointed in the direction of the townhouse and the officer asked him if he had been in any type of a fight there. The driver said that he had not. The officer asked the driver to step out of the car. At that point the driver drove off at a high rate of speed.</SPAN></P>

On review, the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, granted the city's motion to dismiss, concluding that because such quasi-judicial decisions could only be reviewed by writ of certiorari to the instant court, it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The property owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner claimed the actions of the Board were not quasi-judicial, and the city ordinances violated the constitution. There were three considerations in determining whether a decision was quasi-judicial: (1) investigation into a disputed claim and weighing of evidentiary facts; (2) application of those facts to a prescribed standard; and (3) a binding decision. The appellate court found the Board held a hearing at which they considered the evidence, made findings of facts, applied those facts to a prescribed standard, and made a recommendation, which after approval, created a binding decision. Thus, Board's actions were quasi-judicial. Because a writ of certiorari from the court of appeals was the only method of judicial review, the district court correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. However, in the context of a constitutional challenge to a statute or ordinance, the Minnesota Supreme Court had held that a party did not have to exhaust their administrative remedies by seeking a review by writ of certiorari. Thus, the district court erred in determining that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the property owner's declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the inmate's criminal sentences expired, he began his civil commitment. On July 10, 2003, the governor issued Exec. Order No. 03-10, 28 Minn. Reg. 57 (July 21, 2003), which restricted future administrative releases of sexual offenders committed as sexually dangerous persons (SDP) or sexual psychopathic personalities (SPP). The inmate petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the effect of the executive order was to transform his indeterminate civil commitment into a lifetime punitive detention by foreclosing any possibility of release or discharge. The district court dismissed the petition, however, concluding that the inmate had not shown that he was presently being denied a request for a pass into the community, provisional discharge, or other release to which he would be entitled absent the governor's executive order. The instant court declined to review constitutional challenges to statutes when the party making the challenge could not show &quot;direct and personal harm&quot; resulting from the statute. Thus, the instant court declined to address the proper construction of the order or to decide whether the order was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially found guilty of failing to maintain a fence and exceeding the maximum fence height in violation of the city code. A city inspector later returned to defendant's property and found that none of the necessary corrections had been completed. The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, found defendant not guilty of failing to maintain a fence, but guilty of exceeding the maximum fence height. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant raised several issues challenging the constitutionality of the city's fence ordinance, Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 535.420 (2003), and the discriminatory manner in which he was prosecuted; he also contended that his conviction violated double jeopardy. The appellate court disagreed, finding that &sect; 535.420 clearly set forth the height restrictions for fences and was not so indefinite that defendant was forced to guess at its meaning. Further, the purposes set forth in Minneapolis, Minn., Code of Ordinances &sect; 535.370 (2002), were legitimate. The fence ordinance accomplished the purposes for which it was created and was not unconstitutional. As defendant failed to fix the problems with his fence, his violations were part of a continuing offense. Consequently, his convictions did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy. Although defendant argued that others in the same community were violating the same ordinance, he failed to show that the fact that he was prosecuted, while others were not, was based on an impermissible consideration such as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of a constitutional right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and the mother had never married, but the father acknowledged he was the child's father and began paying support. The child, although over the age of 18, was unable to care for himself due to physical and mental disabilities. The magistrate granted the mother's motion as the child's physical and mental conditions classified him as being a child under Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.54, subd. 2 (2002). The father challenged the decision on the grounds that the magistrate did not consider his other two children when increasing the duration of his support obligation, that the mother lacked standing to bring the motion as the child was over 18, and his equal protection rights were violated. The appellate court held that the magistrate erred in failing to consider the father's other two children when extending the support obligation indefinitely as under Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.551 subd. 5f, those facts had to be considered when there was an increase in child support. The court noted that while the father's payments remained the same, the increase in duration constituted an increase in support.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director, who was bisexual, filed this action against the church and claimed that the church's demand that he write a church member a letter of apology concerning the director's claim that the member was homophobic and the director's subsequent discharge for refusing to write the letter violated the Act. The trial court dismissed the action and found that the church was not subject to the Act. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court first held that Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 363A.20, subd. 2, 363A.26(2) (Supp. 2003) were not in conflict, as contended by the director. Because a music director played a religious role for purposes of the Act, the trial court did not err in concluding as a matter of law that the director was a church employee, not a secular employee pursuant to &sect; 363A.26(2), and thus was exempt from the protection of the Act. The court concluded that the constitutional policy under the First Amendment of avoiding entanglement controlled in this case. The church's statements of policy did not specifically waive its exemption from the Act. Therefore, the trial court did not err in dismissing the director's claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 2001, the city adopted Ordinance No. 92, which established licensing requirements for sexually oriented businesses. The city subsequently filed an action against the businesses, who were operating an adult establishment that offered nude dancing. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city on all claims, Minn. R. Civ. P. 56.03. The appellate court affirmed, stating that the district court correctly concluded that the ordinance was constitutional because nude dancing received a lesser degree of U.S. Const. amend. I protection than adult films or books. The ordinance also met the three-prong Renton test. The grant of summary judgment with respect to the license and investigation fees was also appropriate because the businesses did not meet their burden to show that the fees were unreasonable. Summary judgment was also affirmed with respect to the distance restrictions and prohibition against gratuities because the distance restrictions were well defined, narrowly drawn, and did not burden more &quot;speech&quot; than was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant was sent to defendant's apartment to make a controlled purchase of narcotics. Within 72 hours after the controlled purchase, an officer applied for and obtained a search warrant for the residence. Five days later, the warrant was executed. Defendant challenged his conviction for possession of a controlled substance. Defendant claimed that the search warrant lacked probable cause. The instant court disagreed, as the search warrant application established the informant's credibility, and the officer did not need to check the informant's lower body cavities to verify that the informant did not possess money or drugs prior to the controlled purchase. Defendant argued that the trial court should have required disclosure of the informant's identity, but, where an informant was not involved in any of the evidence on which the State relied to establish defendant's guilt, disclosure of his identity was not required. Finally, the search warrant was not stale, as only five days passed between its authorization and execution, which was within the 10 day window of opportunity, Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in: (1) finding that there was probable cause to support a search warrant; (2) admitting DNA evidence; (3) finding that there was insufficient foundation for the introduction of defendant's alternative perpetrator evidence; and (4) requiring defendant to wear a leg restraint during trial. (1) The facts underlying the warrant presented a close call as to whether there was a sufficient showing of probable cause. But, applying a deferential standard of review, sufficient probable cause existed. (2) Defendant's challenges were most appropriately characterized as going not to the admissibility of the evidence, but to its weight to be considered by the trier of fact. The DNA evidence was sufficiently reliable to be admitted. (3) Defendant's substantial rights were affected when the alternative perpetrator evidence was improperly excluded. His inability to address the exclusion of the evidence in the context of the correct legal standard seriously affected the fairness and integrity of his trial. Thus, under the plain error analysis, the conviction was reversed, and he was entitled to a new trial. (4) It was error to restrain defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farmers executed a nationwide consumer fraud class action in which they asserted that the corporation's marketing misled and deceived the farmers into believing that a herbicide of the corporation's could not be used on crops such as sugar beets. The farmers claimed that the corporation's marketing manipulated them into purchasing a higher-priced herbicide, also a product of the corporation's. The corporation appealed the judgment rendered against it for violating the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (NJCFA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 56:8-1-56:8-116 (2002). The Supreme Court of Minnesota held that the problem was the corporation's failure to seek State registration for the herbicide. Further, the corporation engaged in repeated, published, and planned misrepresentations about the herbicide's EPA regulation. It was those actions that the farmers alleged amounted to consumer fraud. Accordingly, the supreme court held that the farmers' claims under the NJCFA were not preempted by Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C.S. &sect; 136 et seq.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal vehicular operation resulting in substantial bodily harm and criminal vehicular operation leaving the scene of the crime.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the trial court granted defendant's motion under Minn. R. Crim. P. 15.07 to plead guilty to two lesser-included gross misdemeanor offenses, it found that, although the State had sufficient evidence to proceed to trial, it would have been a manifest injustice to have defendant prosecuted for a felony. On review, defendant argued that the potential loss of her employment, coupled with the objection by the victim to the felony prosecution, amounted to manifest injustice. The State argued that the factors did not rise to the level of manifest injustice and that the trial court's acceptance of a plea to lesser charges violated the separation of powers provision of the Minnesota Constitution. The supreme court ruled that the standard of proof required to establish a &quot;manifest injustice&quot; under Rule 15.07 was at least as high as that required under Minn. R. Crim. P. 15.05, which necessitated a showing of abuse of prosecutorial discretion, and that the collateral consequences of prosecuting defendant on the felony charges did not constitute a manifest injustice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The secretary of state referred a proposed petition to recall respondent governor to the chief justice of the supreme court for review to determine whether it alleged specific facts that, if proven, would have constituted grounds for recall of the officer under Minn. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6 and Min. Stat. &sect; 211C.02 (2002).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens' petition alleged three grounds for the recall of the governor; namely, nonfeasance in filing an oath of office while a member of the legislature prior to his election as governor; legal defects in the wording of the oath of office of governor he signed on January 6, 2003; and nonfeasance in the performance of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. The supreme court initially noted that recall from an elected official's current office was not permitted for alleged nonfeasance while previously holding a different office. The supreme court held that legal defects in the oath of office was not a basis for recall under Minn. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 6 because a defect in the wording of the oath was neither malfeasance nor nonfeasance. The supreme court further held that the petition did not state facts indicating that the governor knew of an alleged violation of state law, that any failure to act on his part was intentional or repeated, or that any such failure was serious; therefore, the petition failed to state specific facts which, if proven, would have constituted grounds for recall.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was placed on probation after he pleaded guilty to an unrelated charge of promoting prostitution by fraud. He was ordered to register as a predatory offender pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.3461 (1996) (recodified as Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.117 (2002)) and to submit a DNA sample. After analysis of the sample, defendant was identified as a suspect in the sexual assault case, and a second blood sample was taken from defendant pursuant to a warrant. Defendant's attorney did not seek to suppress the sample obtained pursuant to the probation order, and defendant pleaded guilty. The postconviction court and the court of appeals concluded that the prostitution offense was not one for which the statute required a DNA sample and that the probation order constituted an illegal search. The court reversed, holding that the exclusionary rule did not apply because neither the statutory purpose of the DNA sample requirement nor the goal of preventing police misconduct would be served by suppression of DNA evidence seized pursuant to a court order later determined to be erroneous. Thus, defendant did not suffer actual prejudice from counsel's failure to seek suppression of the DNA evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to give jail credit for time he was committed to a juvenile facility under the extended jurisdiction juvenile statute,&nbsp;Minn.

Extended jurisdiction juvenile (EJJ) offenders were prevented by &sect; 260B.130 from receiving credit for time served in juvenile facility custody if the trial court found that the EJJ offender violated the conditions of the stayed adult sentence and reasons existed to revoke the stay of the adult sentence. As defendant's time was confined in a juvenile facility, he was correctly denied credit. At the time of the violation, defendant had fair warning that jail credit would not be awarded if the trial court revoked his stayed adult sentence, and so, &sect; 260B.130 did not violate prohibitions against ex post facto laws. The distinction between a juvenile certified as an adult and an EJJ offender was rationally related to the legitimate government goal of encouraging the rehabilitation of EJJ offenders, so &sect; 260B.130 did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to their divorce, appellant father and respondent mother agreed that the mother would have sole physical custody of the parties' children, but that the father would have average weekly parenting time of 38 percent. The parties did not apply the Hortis/Valento formula to calculate child support. In the instant action, the Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, denied the father's motion to modify his obligation. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Per a 1998 divorce decree, the parties had agreed that the father would pay monthly support of $ 338, somewhat less than that provided by the child-support guidelines. On appeal, the father contended that the trial court erred by refusing to modify his obligation, because he asserted his parenting time had increased substantially. He also argued that he never waived the application of the Hortis/Valento formula, which applied to instances of joint physical custody. Thus, the first issue was whether a child-support obligor's increase in parenting time, standing alone, was a sufficient basis for a downward deviation from child-support guidelines. The appellate court found the parties expressly agreed that there would be no Hortis/Valento application. Because the trial court adopted the parties' stipulation that mother would have &quot;sole physical custody,&quot; it was not presumptively appropriate to set child support under the Hortis/Valento formula. The appellate court also rejected the father's argument that Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.54, subd. 8 (2002) (providing that a sole physical custodian was not an obligor), violated the Equal-Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. The appellate court granted the father's motion to strike a portion of the wife's brief as to certain references appearing for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed a second petition, seeking relief from the continuing obligation to register as a sex offender under Minn. Stat. &sect; 243.166. The district court denied the petition as untimely without a hearing. The court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion by summarily denying petitioner's second petition for postconviction relief. The relief sought was substantially the same as that sought in his first petition. The registration issue and complaints about counsel were not novel or new and could have been raised in the first petition. The court did not need to address the convict's arguments that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction and that the registration statute unconstitutionally violated due process because neither argument was raised in either of his postconviction petitions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot the victim, his girlfriend. Prior to shooting her, he placed the gun in her mouth, pulled the trigger, and chipped her teeth pulling the gun out of her mouth.

During the police interview, the officer asked whether there was any reason why defendant's prints would be on the gun, and told defendant that the victim may not live. Defendant claimed that his statement that the shooting was accidental was not voluntary based on the officer's statements. The appellate court affirmed that defendant's statement was properly admitted as defendant had waived his rights, he had the ability to make a voluntary statement, the interrogation lasted less than an hour, and defendant did not confess to a crime. The appellate court also held that the admission of the prior felonies as impeachment evidence was proper under Minn. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff airline appealed an order of the Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, that dismissed its action which sought a declaratory judgment that Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn., Ordinance 87, violated Minn. Stat. &sect; 473.651 (2002) and was beyond defendant airport commission's authority under Minn. Stat. &sect; 473.651 (2002). The commission argued exhaustion of administrative remedies under Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airline argued that &quot;may,&quot; as used in Minn. Stat. &sect; 473.608, subd. 17(6), was permissive and thus exhaustion was not required. If the claim had been brought on constitutional grounds, the declaratory judgment action could have been an appropriate remedy. But, the claim was not a bona fide challenge to the validity or constitutionality of the ordinance, to which the doctrine of &quot;futility&quot; might relieve it of the exhaustion requirement. The airline asserted that rates were set too low for other airports, so it had to pay too much to subsidize the smaller &quot;relief airports.&quot; The airline called the ordinance a violation of state law, and an ordinance interfering with its constitutional right to due process, but in reality its grievance came down to money. The commission was required to give the airline the rate relief it sought or tell the airline it was not going to give the relief sought. That denial of relief would mean the airline could then properly bring a direct lawsuit. The commission was advised to act reasonably and quickly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, entered a pretrial order suppressing evidence and dismissing a driving while intoxicated (DWI) charge against defendant. The appellate court previously reversed the trial court's order; however, the Minnesota Supreme Court stayed the appeal pending the resolution of a similar case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant driving a vehicle displaying WZ plates indicating prior DWI arrests. After the officer's patrol car passed defendant's vehicle, defendant looked at the officer, slowed his vehicle, changed lanes, and exited the highway. The officer then pursued defendant, stopped him, and arrested him for DWI. After staying defendant's appeal, the Minnesota Supreme Court held that Minn. Stat. &sect; 168.0422 was unconstitutional and that special series plates could not provide the sole justification for a traffic stop. The appellate court held that an investigative stop required reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity, and that a vehicle's display of WZ special-series plates could only be considered as one factor in the totality of the circumstances. The appellate court further held that although the police report stated that defendant looked at the patrol car as it passed to his right, any careful driver seeking to change lanes before exiting the freeway would have done the same; therefore, other than the special series license plate there was no reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity to justify the traffic stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Wright County District Court (Minnesota) denied appellant father's motion to terminate or reduce his child support obligation and rejected his constitutional challenge to the inclusion of mentally impaired persons within the definition of child in Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.54, subd. 2 (2002). The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that two of the parties' children were mentally handicapped and not self-supporting because they would not be able to take care of their basic living needs on an independent basis. Thus, the trial court then denied the father's motion to terminate or reduce his child support for those two children. Additionally, in denying the father's motion to reduce or terminate his child support obligation, the trial court found that the father was currently paying less than the child support guidelines amount and he had failed to show a substantial change in circumstances that made the existing child support amount unreasonable or unfair. The appellate court agreed with the trial court's findings. Finally, although Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.54, subd. 2 (2002) provided the trial court jurisdiction, the father's child support obligation flowed not from the operation of the statute but from the operation of the parties' stipulation regarding the amount of child support. Therefore, the father's argument that Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.54, subd. 2 (2002) was unconstitutional lacked an adequate factual or legal foundation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, but found that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. The unconstitutional provision was severed and the State amended its complaint. Defendant was found guilty as charged, and the court affirmed on appeal. Defendant claimed that Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.246, subd. 1(f)(2)(i), (ii) (2000) was unconstitutionally overbroad. Because defendant did not make this argument to the trial court, the court generally would have deemed the issue waived. Even were it not waived, the challenge failed because case law held that the statute subdivisions were not overbroad because they only criminalized possession of pornographic works involving real children. Because defendant's proposed jury instruction would have added an element to the crime, it was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (the State) charged defendant nonresident minnow hauler with six counts of violating Minnesota state game and fish laws relating to the transport of minnows. The Freeborn County District Court, Minnesota, found defendant guilty as charged and imposed a 30-day stayed sentence, one year of probation, and a $ 950 fine. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant challenged his convictions, arguing that he successfully asserted an affirmative defense created by Minn. Stat. &sect; 97A.255, subd. 2(a) (2000) and the minnow-transport laws under which he was charged discriminating against interstate commerce. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err by concluding that defendant had no grounds upon which to assert the affirmative defense set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 97A.255, subd. 2(a) (2000) as none of the minnows in defendant's possession came from waters licensed as aquatic farms as defined by the Minnesota Aquaculture Development Act, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 17.46-.4999 (2000). The appellate court also found that the 12-hour permit required of all persons to transport minnows through the state and the provision requiring an exporting minnow-hauler's vehicle license were constitutional. However, the appellate court also found that by imposing a differential license fee that favored resident minnow haulers and exporters over their nonresident counterparts, Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 97A.475, subd. 28(1); 97C.501, subd. 4(a) (2000) discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was confined at a correctional facility and was almost 68 years old when a police officer petitioned for his civil commitment as a SPP and a SDP. Appellant was civilly committed for an indeterminate period. On appeal, the court found that appellant provided no legal support for his contention that the trial court was required to have evidence other than his pre-commitment behavior to support the finding of dangerousness. The court further found that the evidence in the record showed a likelihood of serious physical harm supporting the order. The findings reflected appellant's multiple physical acts of digital penetration and fondling of children, use of force and manipulation on victims, and the consequent embarrassment and humiliation of the victims. The commitment order was based on sufficient evidence of the likelihood of serious physical harm resulting from a release. Finally, the court found that the evidence of lack of control and the court-appointed examiners' opinions that they were unaware of a program providing the security necessary to protect the public defeated appellant's claim of a satisfactory alternative to commitment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher argued that, because TRA provided an estimate of the value of her pension benefit at the time of her marriage dissolution, and because she relied on that estimate in entering into a marital termination agreement, TRA was estopped from denying the service credit she sought. The appellate court first needed to conclude that the TRA had authority to grant the service credits the teacher sought. The TRA Board affirmed the TRA Executive Director's determination that the payments received by the teacher had to be characterized as &quot;severance&quot; payments that were typically excluded from TRA's definition of salary and therefore ineligible for service credits. Even if the payments to the teacher did not constitute severance payments, the teacher did not show that they constituted payments for any type of leave for which Minn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that a police officer blocked defendant's vehicle in order to ask defendant to move the car from the no parking zone next to a handicap parking space. Upon approaching the vehicle the officer smelled alcohol, and defendant gave false information before giving his true name and birthdate. Defendant was arrested on outstanding warrants, escaped, and was recaptured. Charges of giving a false name and birth date, and escape from custody were dismissed by the State but he was convicted of the remaining charges. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motions to suppress. The court held that the officer's action in blocking defendant's car constituted a seizure under Minn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, because a reasonable person would not have felt free to end the encounter. However, the court held that the seizure was reasonable. The officer's sole purpose in approaching was to ask defendant to move his car. The court held that it was reasonable for the officer to ensure defendant would not suddenly drive away as the officer approached, and pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 169.346, subd. 3, the officer was authorized to enforce parking violations related to handicap spaces.</SPAN></P>

After he twice violated probation, the district court executed his adult sentence and refused to give him credit for juvenile custody time spent at a Minnesota Correctional Facility. Appellant challenged that refusal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, then 14, was involved in an armed robbery. Appellant was adjudicated delinquent, received a stayed adult sentence of 58 months, and was placed on supervised juvenile probation. Appellant returned to court on a probation violation. The district court found that appellant violated probation and ordered him to complete a juvenile corrections program. Appellant completed the program and was released to a foster home placement. Appellant absconded from his foster home and was subsequently arrested, certified as an adult, and charged with second-degree assault. The district court again found that he violated his probation and continued the matter until his pending adult charge had been resolved. The district court revoked appellant's EJJ status and executed his stayed 58-month adult sentence. The district denied him credit for time appellant served at the juvenile facility. Because the probation violation that led to appellant's time served at the juvenile facility occurred after the amendment to Minn. Stat. &sect; 260B.130, subd. 5 (2002), the statute did not violate the ex post facto clause and the district court properly applied the statute and refused to grant him jail credit.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 617.247, subd. 8, violated due process by shifting the burden of proof on an element of the offense, namely the age of the person or persons depicted in a &quot;pornographic work.&quot; The court of appeals disagreed. In Myrland, a saving construction of Minn. Stat. &sect; 617.247, subd. 8, was adopted under which that provision placed on defendants only the burden of production, not the burden of persuasion. In addition, The stipulated record established that defendant sent by e-mail to a police officer posing as a 13-year-old girl pornographic pictures of girls who defendant himself represented to be about the same age as he understood the recipient to be. Defendant told the police at least some of the pictures were of girls under the age of 18. In contrast to that abundant evidence showing how the State could have met its burden of proof on the element of age, the stipulation included no evidence that the defense proposed to submit on the element of age. Therefore, even if defendant showed that the affirmative defense was unconstitutional, there were no ground to reverse his conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Stevens County District Court (Minnesota) certified the questions of (1) whether Minn. Stat. &sect; 340A.503, subd. 1(a)(1) (1998), as it related to whether appellant licensee &quot;permitted&quot; an underage person to drink alcohol on the licensed premises, required proof by the State that the licensee acted with knowledge of the alleged statutory violation and (2) whether the statute was unconstitutionally vague with respect to the term &quot;permit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee was charged with two misdemeanor counts of permitting underage persons to drink alcoholic beverages on its licensed premises in violation of &sect; 340A.503, subd. 1(a)(1). The licensee moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The licensee also objected to the district court's proposed jury instructions, which did not require the State to prove that the licensee had knowledge of the violation or specific intent. The district court denied the motion to dismiss but granted the licensee's request that the jury be instructed that the State was required to prove that the licensee acted with knowledge of the alleged violation. The district court then certified the two questions to the court. The court affirmed the district court's ruling and concluded that the meaning of the word &quot;permit&quot; as used in &sect; 340A.503, subd. 1(a)(1), was clear and required an element of knowledge of the violation such that the licensee authorized, tolerated, or ratified the sale of intoxicating liquor to minors. Because the word &quot;permit&quot; unambiguously required an element of knowledge of the violation, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Steele County District Court, Minnesota, denying his motion to correct his sentence. On appeal, the instant court determined that the 10-year conditional release term could be reduced to 42 months and made to run concurrently with the supervised release term of the same duration. The State petitioned for review, and the matter was remanded for reconsideration by the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of second-degree assault. Defendant was found to be a patterned sex offender, and was sentenced to 126 months, of which 84 months were to be served in prison and 42 months on supervised release. The district court ordered defendant to provide a DNA sample, register as a sex offender, and pay restitution. The appellate court ruled that no conditional-release term could be imposed on defendant. Defendant was convicted only of second-degree assault, an offense for which the statute did not mandate any conditional-release term, Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.222 (1996). No conditional-release term could have been imposed except under the patterned-sex-offender statute,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.1352, subd. 5 (1996). However, the statute operated in violation of Apprendi to increase the sentence beyond the ordinary statutory maximum based on a judicial finding. Because defendant was sentenced to a conditional-release term in addition to the statutory maximum sentence, and since there was no other authority for imposing the conditional-release term that did not rely on a judicial finding, defendant's 10-year conditional-release term had to be vacated.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. The fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine did not exclude evidence obtainable by an independent source. The information obtained from the internet service provider (ISP) linked defendant's screen name to defendant's real name and residence. The affidavit also set forth information about the chat-room dialogue between defendant and the victim indicating that defendant was providing sexual material to the victim and had personally met with the victim. There was also evidence of defendant's prior conviction for having sex with a 14-year-old boy. The evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that the information from the Ramsey County search warrant was not necessary to establish probable cause for the Hennepin County warrant and a sanitized application for the Hennepin County warrant provided independent probable cause for its issuance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for postconviction relief, arguing that he was entitled to open the omnibus hearing and the increased sentence recommended by the State pursuant to the second plea agreement was the result of prosecutorial vindictiveness.

Defendant argued that the allegation of prosecutorial vindictiveness, if proved, raised a nonwaivable constitutional claim entitling defendant to an evidentiary hearing. The appellate court found that a claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness was nonjurisdictional and therefore was waived by defendant's guilty plea. The prosecutor's alleged statement did not present a violation that might warrant the appellate court's review despite the waiver. There was no element of punishment or retaliation so long as the accused was free to accept or reject the prosecution's offer.</SPAN></P>

The church appealed, arguing it was not an employer under Minn. Stat. &sect; 518.611 (1990). The order was reversed and remanded. The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, ordered judgment for arrearages against the church. The church appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the church contended, inter alia, that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the claim against the church for compliance with the child-support withholding statute. Contrary to the church's argument, the appellate court held that the trial court could apply &sect; 518.6111 to the church without excessive entanglement in the church's religious affairs as the determination of whether the relationship between the church and the husband made the church subject to &sect; 518.611 could be made by religiously neutral factors. Thus, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction. The appellate court also found that requiring the church to comply with &sect; 518.6111 did not infringe on the church's right to free exercise of religion. The state had a compelling interest in securing child support from the husband, and this interest extended to the church, or any other entity that could have been required to perform income withholding for the husband. Although the statute in question was amended before the remand was decided, the appellate court found that the results should have been the same under either version.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured's leased vehicle was damaged in an accident. The insurer paid for repairs to the vehicle, and the insured filed a class-action suit asserting that the value of her vehicle was diminished as a result of being in an accident and that the insurer's policy covered the loss. The trial court granted the insured's motion for injunctive relief and effectively ordered the insurer to either change the language of its policy to specifically exclude diminished-value loss or notify a class of insureds that they were entitled to diminished-value loss. The trial court also ordered all money-damages claims were subject to mandatory arbitration, Minn. Stat. &sect; 65B.525 (2002). The appellate court ruled that the trial court's exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction was proper because the insurer in earlier stages of the litigation had denied coverage, and the policy coverage for diminished value was a legal issue subject to judicial determination. Also, the appellate court found that the injunction was a permanent injunction, as it followed a determination on the merits, and that the issuance of the injunction and bond requirement should be reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer saw a man that he recognized as defendant, called dispatch, and found that defendant had outstanding warrants.

The court affirmed the conviction, stating that the record showed that the district court found that defendant did not present any exceptional circumstances that would have warranted appointment of substitute counsel. Further, Minn. Stat. &sect; 152.023, subd. 2(4) (2002), under which he was convicted, did not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Minnesota Constitution. Defendant chose to walk through a school zone with crack cocaine in his possession and in doing so he assumed a risk that he would be stopped and arrested. Thus, he failed to show that &sect; 152.023, subd. 2(4) was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were parents of students who were injured in a physical education class. The parents sued respondent school district to recover for the students' personal injuries. The school district moved to dismiss the suit, asserting that it was immune from tort liability under Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.12, subd. 3a (2002). The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, granted the school district's motion. The parents appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents and students were African-Americans. Minn. Stat. &sect; 466.12, subd. 3a (2002) provided immunity from tort liability, if the commissioner of insurance certified that a school district was unable to obtain insurance for a cost of $ 1.50 or less per pupil per year. The school district obtained the certification. However, the school district's student population was 45 percent African American and was the only one in the state to have received such certification. The parents argued that the statute created a class of African-American students, who were prevented from suing, that same constituted an Equal Protection Clause violation, and that strict scrutiny was applicable. However, &sect; 466.12, subd. 3a prevented any person injured by the school district, regardless of race, from bringing suit, if the statutory requirements were met. Given alleged racial impact, Minnesota's stricter standard of rational basis review was appropriate. But, the appellate court held there was insufficient evidence from which the district court could determine whether the rate of $ 1.50 per student was arbitrary or permitted constitutional operation of the statute and dismissal was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the trial court that the rational basis standard was the appropriate level of review as to the parents' claims was affirmed. However, the judgment of the trial court dismissing the action was reversed, and the matter was remanded for further proceedings on whether the operation of the statute violated the Minnesota Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, denied appellants' motions for summary judgment, concluding that the action was not barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an amended order, the trial court certified as important and doubtful a question as to what the proper length of time was that applied to wrongful death actions premised on allegations of medical malpractice brought after August 1, 1999. On review, appellant contended that, because the legislature did not amend the wrongful-death statute of limitations when it amended the medical-malpractice statute of limitations in 1999, the wrongful-death statute continued to refer to the two-year limitations provision set forth in Minn. Stat. &sect; 541.07 (1998). The appellate court held that the claim was governed by the statute of limitations in effect at the time the action was brought. The statute of limitations for wrongful-death actions premised on allegations of medical malpractice brought between August 1, 1999, and July 31, 2002, was four years from the date the cause of action accrued. Under Minn. Stat. &sect; 573.02, subd. 1 (2002), the statute of limitations for wrongful-death actions premised on medical malpractice brought on or after August 1, 2002, was three years from the date of death, provided the action was brought within four years from the date the cause of action accrued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, there were three issues: (1) whether the DPA applied to the board's search for a university president; (2) whether the OML applied to the board's search for a university president; and (3) whether the Minnesota Constitution precluded the application of the OML or the DPA to the board's search for a university president. The appellate court concluded that the DPA applied to the university's procedure for selecting its president, as Minn. Stat. &sect; 13.02, subd. 17 specifically included the university as a state agency, and the statute had no language excluding the activity of the board's search for a university president. In addition, the OML applied to the university's procedure for selecting its president, as the OML did not contain an exception for searches for a university president. Finally, the Minnesota Constitution did not preclude imposing the OML and the DPA on the university's procedure for selecting its president, as the restrictions imposed by the DPA and the OML were merely procedural: the board could choose the president at its sole discretion, but it had to do so in accord with the DPA and the OML.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a wife and husband, alleged the wife was subjected to a sexual relationship with a priest against her will, and they sued defendant diocese, for sexual abuse/sexual exploitation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, loss of consortium, and negligent hiring and retention. The Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, granted summary judgment to the diocese on all claims. The wife and husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues on appeal were whether the priest provided psychotherapy within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect; 148A.01, subd. 6 (2002), and whether the sexual assault statutes,&nbsp;Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.344, subd. 1(l) and 609.345 , subd. 1(l) (2002), violated the Establishment Clause, as applied to a priest-penitent relationship. The appellate court held the priest did not provide the wife professional treatment or counseling of a mental illness, within the meaning of Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 148A.01, subd. 6, and 148A.02 (2002). The communications regarding the intimate details of their lives, which did lead to a sexual relationship, did not come within the statutory meaning of psychotherapy. Thus, summary judgment for the diocese as to the husband and wife's claim pursuant to Minn. Stat. ch. 148A was proper. Secondly, having courts determine whether the &quot;advice, aid, or comfort&quot; provided by a member of the clergy in private was &quot;religious,&quot; did not violate the Establishment Clause by fostering excessive governmental entanglement with religion. Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.344, subd. 1(l), and 609.345, subd. 1(l) (2002), were not facially unconstitutional as violations of the Establishment Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving an anonymous 911 call that there was a tan Ford Explorer proceeding eastbound on a certain road, and that the car was swerving all over the road, an officer went to the location and observed the individual erratically move into the right lane after swerving into the left turn lane. The individual's testimony about the officer's location, the officer's ability to observe the individual's driving conduct, and traffic swerving to avoid the oncoming squad car was contradicted by the officer's testimony and the tape of the 911 call. Revocation of the individual's driver's license was affirmed because (1) the officer had reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop the individual based on the information from the 911 call and the officer's observation of the individual's erratic driving; and (2) even if the officer had based the stop solely on the anonymous call, the call alone was sufficiently reliable to form a constitutional basis for the stop in that the caller described the suspect vehicle and its location, stated that the driver was &quot;loaded,&quot; swerving all over the road, and almost hit him, and the caller described his own vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a trade association of vending-machine operators and an operator (operators), sought a declaratory judgment that the application of the Minnesota sales tax to all sales of food in vending machines violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1 and the Uniformity Clause of Minn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The Ramsey County District Court, Minnesota, granted summary judgment to respondent State. The operators appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the operators contended the classification under Minn. Stat. &sect; 297A.61 (Supp. 2001) was unconstitutional, as it made the sale of vending-machine food always taxable, and it made the sale of the same food by others taxable only when sold in defined contexts. The appellate court first noted that Minnesota previously upheld this distinction. Applying the Miller Brewing test for determining whether there was a rational basis for the classification, the appellate court held that the limited reach of the distinction was not manifestly arbitrary and therefore, the first prong of the test was satisfied. The second prong was satisfied, as adopting a simple rule and raising revenue with administrative ease were relevant purposes of the statute. Finally, the third prong was satisfied, as the purposes and advantages of the uniform act were legitimate, and because there were legitimate reasons for not drawing distinctions between various vending-machine sales. As such, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in the State's favor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised several issues on review, including constitutional challenges to Minn. Stat. &sect;&sect; 609.72, subd. 1(3), 609.50, subd. 1(1) (2000). The appellate court found that established precedent held that neither statute was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The disorderly conduct statute's proscription of abusive and boisterous conduct applied to both defendant's speech and her physical conduct in resisting the officers and her oral statements; the obstruction of legal process statute applied to the allegations against defendant that her physical conduct interfered with the officers. Evidence of defendant's intentional physical and verbal conduct was sufficient to support her convictions. Denial of defendant's motion to dismiss for discriminatory enforcement was proper as her allegations were frivolous and conclusory. As the existence of defendant's civil lawsuit against the officers was not probative of any of the facts in the criminal case, excluding the evidence of the civil lawsuit was proper. However, the trial court's denial of a Schwartz hearing was an abuse of discretion as defendant met her evidentiary burden that jurors committed misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As appellant inmate's release date approached, the department of corrections recommended that respondent State seek civil commitment of the inmate as a sexual psychopathic personality (SPP) or sexually dangerous person (SDP).

The inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the inmate contended that the State did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that: he was an SPP; he was an SDP; or commitment to the Minnesota Sex Offender Program (MSOP) was the least-restrictive alternative. The appellate court found the inmate's convictions for attempted rape, indecent liberties, burglary with intent to commit indecent liberties, possession of child pornography, and four counts of criminal sexual conduct was sufficient evidence showing the inmate engaged in a habitual course of sexual misconduct and had an utter lack of power to control his sexual impulses. His extensive history of committing violent sexual assaults, along with doctors' testimony that it was highly probable the inmate would re-offend if not committed was sufficient evidence that the inmate was dangerous to other persons. As such, the trial court did not err by committing the inmate as an SPP and an SPD. As the inmate cited to no evidence showing that supervised release would achieve his treatment needs and the requirements of public safety, the appellate court declined to conclude that supervised release would have been an appropriate less-restrictive alternative.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditors had previously obtained a judgment against the homeowner. The trial court issued a writ of execution on the judgment, which was declared a lien against the homeowner's property. The sheriff sold the property to the creditors. The trial court confirmed the sale, awarded attorney fees to the creditors, and ordered the homeowner not to commit waste. The court affirmed in part on appeal. The homeowner's property was subject to execution as long as his wife's interest was protected. The court rejected the homeowner's claim that Minn. Stat. &sect; 550.175, subd. 4 (2002) was unconstitutional as applied. No erroneous deprivation occurred, given that the homeowner's wife had notice of the proceedings and was given a chance to be heard. Section 550.175, subd. 4 did not violate equal protection or treat similarly situated persons differently. Because the statutory language of &sect; 550.175, subd. 4 was clear, the court refused to find that a cash sale was required or that the credit sale to the creditors was invalid. The defect in the notice did not affect the validity of the sale. Remand was necessary on the fees issue for further fact-finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of 2 counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct in the Becker County District Court, Minnesota. The trial court concluded that petitioner was a patterned sex offender and sentenced him to 2 consecutive 40-year prison terms with a conditional-release period of 10 years upon completion of the prison sentence. Petitioner's petition for postconviction relief was denied, and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that petitioner was a danger to public safety, as: (1) he had two prior felony convictions for criminal sexual conduct; (2) he committed the acts with the two child victims in the instant case shortly after he was released on parole for the prior convictions; and (3) he violated a position of trust in committing the acts perpetrated upon the child victims. The district court also found that, based on a psychologist's report, petitioner was in need of long-term treatment, beyond the presumptive term of imprisonment and supervised release. Citing Teague v. Lane regarding new constitutional rules of criminal procedure, the appellate court declined to apply Apprendi v. New Jersey retroactively to the petition for postconviction relief. Petitioner failed to show there was insufficient evidence to support the district court's finding that he was a patterned sex offender. Petitioner also failed to show that the facts in his case were so similar to those in the other patterned-sex-offender cases that he cited as to give rise to an equal-protection violation, and his sentence did not require a showing of &quot;severe aggravating circumstances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court also held petitioner's sentence was within the limits of the patterned-sex-offender statute, which did not violate the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 256B.0625, subd. 3a (2002) for respondent insured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured consulted with a gender-identity-disorder specialist and sought treatment for gender dysphoria. After the insured successfully completed drug treatment and participated in gender dysphoria therapy, she began hormone therapy. The insurer denied coverage for the requested gender reassignment surgery based on its determination that the insured had not commenced &quot;gender reassignment services&quot; before July 1, 1998, which was required by Minn. Stat. &sect; 256B.0625, subd. 3a (2002). DHS affirmed, but the trial court reversed and found the statute unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, but did not reach the constitutional argument. The court held that &quot;gender reassignment services&quot; in the statute meant work done by a person who sought treatment to address the behavior and feelings of the biological sex different than his or her own. Thus, the court held that the plain meaning of the phrase included treatments for gender dysphoria and for chemical dependency required to begin hormone therapy. Because the insured completed these services prior to July 1, 1998, she met the statutory coverage requirements for the surgery.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State dismissed a charge of carrying a weapon without a valid permit, and defendant waived his right to take an appeal on an evidentiary ruling. On appeal, defendant argued that giving effect to the waiver of his right to appeal on a ground related to the trial court's admission of the magazines into evidence would violate public policy and the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the magazines. The appellate court held that defendant's waiver was valid and did not reach the merits of his appeal. The court found that defendant did not waive his right to appeal from a conviction on the charges of driving while impaired and fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle or his right to appeal all of the district court's evidentiary rulings. Defendant instead waived the right to appeal a specific evidentiary ruling related to the count that the State dismissed. Thus, in return for the waiver, defendant received an important concession from the State: he no longer faced the weapon count, and his right to appeal from convictions on the other two counts was preserved. Equally important, defendant did not dispute that his waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.</SPAN></P>

The present action was the inmate's fifth appeal to the appellate court. The appellate court ruled that because the inmate was attempting once again to raise challenges to his original commitment and because the standards applied to his original commitment satisfied the constitutional requirements of set out by the U.S. Supreme Court, the denial of the inmate's petition for habeas corpus relief was proper. Even if the basis for the inmate's original commitment was weak, the issue had been repeatedly raised and rejected, and the inmate was collaterally estopped from again raising a challenge to the validity of his original commitment. By determining that the evidence showed that the inmate was unable to control or had no control over his sexual impulses, the committing court and the appellate court on appeal made lack-of-control determinations required by the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

The officer had observed defendant, who carried an object that appeared to be a gun, turn away as the squad car approached and make a furtive motion consistent with shoving this object into his waistband. With the assistance of a spotlight, the officer had observed, from 10 to 20 feet away, what appeared to be the handle of a gun sticking out of defendant's waistband. Based on that record, the officer had reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity at the time the seizure occurred.

The record did not show the distance between the two trailers. However, they were on opposite sides of the driveway, and there was no evidence of any enclosure surrounding the two trailers. The record did not show that defendant took steps to protect the white trailer from observation. To the contrary, an officer stated that the door to the white trailer was partially open, and its windows had no coverings. In addition, an informant's information was corroborated where the officer observed that the property's layout exactly matched the informant's description and that the white trailer contained numerous items associated with the methamphetamine-manufacturing process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractor contracted with a translating and transportation agency to obtain accident reports each morning to determine if members of a certain ethnic community had been injured. If so, the company contacted the victim and solicited them to become patients of the chiropractor. The company was paid for its services. The board held that the chiropractor's practices constituted fee splitting in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 148.10, subd. 1(a)(16) (2002), and unprofessional conduct in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 148.10, subd. 1(a)(11), (e). The appellate court reversed the finding that the chiropractor had engaged in fee splitting as &sect; 148.10, subd. 1(a)(16) did not prohibit chiropractors from paying individuals to solicit accident victims, and there was no evidence that the chiropractor had engaged in fee splitting. The finding that the chiropractor had engaged in unprofessional conduct in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 148.10, subd. 1(a)(11), (e) was upheld, as the board had the right to determine what constituted unprofessional conduct on a case by case basis. The appellate court struck that portion of the board's brief that was not supported by the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board's decision that the chiropractor engaged in fee splitting was reversed as it was not supported by substantial evidence, but the decision that the chiropractor engaged in unprofessional conduct was supported by substantial evidence and was affirmed on that basis. The chiropractor's motion to strike portions of the board's brief was granted in part.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that &sect; 611.17(c) did not violate the equal protection clause as similarly situated persons were not being treated differently on the basis of economic status or race under &sect; 611.17(c).

The city ordinance specifically listed each of these as a valid reason for denying the license. The appellate court upheld the city's refusal to issue a license, as: (1) the company's constitutional challenge to the city ordinance was beyond the scope of review on appeal by certiorari; (2) the record of evidence that was before the city counsel was sufficient to support the denial of the license, and the reasons for the denial of the license were not unreasonable or arbitrary; (3) given that the company did not dispute the evidence, any concern about whether the company should have received more detailed and timely notice as to the specifics of the police incidents was effectively negated, as the company was not prejudiced; and (4) the ordinance did not allow unfettered discretion, in that the language of the ordinance was not overbroad or vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of fourth-degree assault of a tribal peace officer in the Becker County District Court, Minnesota. The assault occurred on White Earth tribal land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the White Earth tribal officer, had the jurisdictional authority to arrest defendant within the boundaries of the White Earth reservation. Defendant maintained that the federal government had not granted Minnesota the right to enter into cooperative agreements with tribes to enforce criminal statutes on reservations. The appellate court noted that Public Law 280 of 1953, Pub. L. No. 83-280, 67 Stat. 588-89 (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1162(a)), provided Minnesota with jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians in the areas of Indian country. Public Law 280 was later amended to allow state governments to retrocede its jurisdiction over a tribe. But in the specific case of the White Earth Reservation, the State had not done so. Most importantly, the State ad entered into a &quot;cooperative agreements&quot; with the White Earth Reservation, to &quot;regulate the provision of law enforcement services,&quot; pursuant to Minn. Stat. &sect; 626.93, subd. 4 (2002). The appellate court held the tribal officer was authorized to arrest defendant, and defendant's conviction was supported by sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court held the cooperative agreement between the tribe and the State of Minnesota was not invalid for the purposes of the criminal prosecution at issue. Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals disagreed. A police officer testified that the purpose for her search was to insure that there were no other people in the house after defendant and two others had been taken into custody. When the officer and her partner responded to the call, the victim was at a neighbor's house and she gave her version of the events to the officers. The victim told them she knew of at least three people in the house. She also told them a gun had been used in the incident as well as some black handcuffs and that she believed the gun would be found in defendant's bedroom in the dresser. Because the victim said that the gun would be found in a dresser in defendant's bedroom, the officer proceeded to that room. Upon entering she noticed that some of the dresser drawers were open, that she could see into the drawers, and that she saw the handcuffs. Because they were found in plain sight during a legitimate search for people and weapons at the time of the arrests, the court properly denied the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient had a long history of attempting to assault a certain victim. He pled guilty to various crimes, and he was committed to a treatment program in prison. However, he failed to complete the program and continued his assaultive behavior. Because of the patient's continued behavior, the county filed a petition to have him committed as a sexually dangerous person under the SDPA. After the county's petition was denied, it sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the district court erred when it determined that the patient's conduct toward the victim after his release from prison was not motivated by sexual impulses. Further, the patient's actions toward the victim created a substantial likelihood of serious emotional harm within the scope of Minn. Stat. &sect; 253B.02, subd. 7a(b) (2002). In addition, a review of the patient's records indicated that he was unable to control his sexual impulses. Therefore, the district court should have determined whether or not the patient was likely to engage in future harmful sexual acts. Finally, the court found that the patient's constitutional challenges to the SDPA were meritless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's decision to deny the county's petition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While performing an inventory search of defendant's vehicle, the officer discovered a .40-caliber automatic pistol in the passenger compartment. Defendant was previously adjudicated delinquent for felony theft of a motor vehicle, an offense that was not then characterized as a crime of violence. Because the predicated offense rendering defendant ineligible to possess a firearm was not classified as a crime of violence until after defendant had been adjudicated, defendant argued that retroactive classification of the predicated offense as a violent crime, and his subsequent prosecution and conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm, was an unconstitutional ex post facto application of the law. The appellate court ruled that neither of the challenged statutes, standing alone or in combination, violated the ex-post-facto-law prohibition, either facially or as applied to defendant. The application of Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.712, subd. 5 (2000) to include defendant's past offense as a crime of violence merely exposed defendant to possible punishment for a future violation of possession of a firearm, Minn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the evidence supporting his conviction was obtained in violation of the Minnesota and United States Constitutions after he was seized without a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The appellate court found that because the Minnesota Supreme Court did not adopt the United States Supreme Court's more restrictive definition of when a person had been seized, if defendant was not seized under the Minnesota Constitution, he was not seized under the United States Constitution. The officers did not seize defendant when they pulled over to talk to him. Because the officer saw the shape of a handgun in defendant's bag and defendant admitted that he had a gun, the officer had a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and was justified in seizing defendant and the bag. Defendant's earlier conviction of being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm was one of the offenses listed in Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11, subd. 9 (2000), so defendant was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months. Although Minn. Stat. &sect; 609.11, subd. 8(b), dictated the minimum sentence that the court had to impose, it did not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine.</SPAN></P>

The Council denied his application based on the individual's poor rental and credit history. The individual had moved out of an apartment and left significant property damage and outstanding damage amount of $ 1,347, had three unpaid civil judgments, and seven accounts in collection. The individual disputed the outstanding balance that was owed to the landlord of the apartment. The appellate court affirmed the Council's decision as federal law did not require that a public housing agency look only at an applicant's prior history in paying rent. Given the outstanding judgments and accounts that were in collection, the Council's decision to deny the individual's application was not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with one count of possession of a pistol by a minor, in violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 624.713, subds. 1(a), 2 (2002). At the Rasmussen hearing, defendant challenged the validity of a pat-down search and sought suppression of the pistol. The Ramsey County District Court (Minnesota) determined that none of the Curtis exceptions applied and suppressed the pistol as the fruit of an illegal pat-down search. The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court concluded that the pat-down search was illegal, as defendant was not under arrest and because he was not exhibiting conduct that would indicate that he might have been a threat to the officers. Although the city curfew ordinance had no specific stated purpose, the appellate court assumed that its intent was to give police officers the authority to remove juveniles from environments where they could be in danger of becoming victims of crime or could themselves participate in illegal conduct. The officers observed a group of individuals, who looked like juveniles and were wearing gang colors, standing at a bus shelter after curfew and throwing garbage onto the street. Defendant was with a known and violent gang member. Those observations gave the officers a reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that there was a curfew violation. The moment the officers were required to transport defendant in the squad car, the pat-down search was necessary for the officers' protection. It was also reasonable for the officers to assume that an adult was not supervising defendant. Their failure to make further inquiries about an adult supervisor was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the public hearing, city transportation engineer stated that the project was the result of a neighborhood petition that circulated for three years. The city engineer also stated that the petition met the city's threshold requirement of approval by 65 percent of the affected property owners. The city council adopted a resolution directing the installation of decorative street lighting and the use of special assessments to pay the cost of the project. The property owners who objected to the special assessment appealed to the district court, which granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The appellate court determined that the property owners' affidavits did not create a fact issue for district, because, when viewed in the light most favorable to the property owners, the affidavits did not establish the property owners' claim that the decorative lighting installed in the neighborhood did not increase the market value of any property in the neighborhood. Additionally, the appellate court found that a statutory remedy was available and adequate; thus, the district court did not err in denying the property owners' motion to certify a class action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized on the basis that the warrant application did not contain particularized reasonable suspicion to justify a nighttime search was denied and, following a court trial, defendant was convicted of and sentenced in the Hennepin County District Court, Minnesota, for fifth-degree controlled-substance crime. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that the warrant application did not contain sufficiently particularized reason to justify a nighttime or no-knock entry. However, the district court further found that the violation of Minn. Stat. &sect; 626.14 (2000) was technical in nature and denied defendant's motion to suppress. On appeal defendant argued, inter alia, that the admittedly defective nighttime execution provision of the warrant was a constitutional violation requiring suppression of the evidence seized. The appellate court agree. Although police witnessed defendant clothed and sitting in his living room before executing the search warrant, and knocked and announced themselves, the warrant was executed almost two hours later than the statute allowed, there were no people coming or going from the residence, and the door was closed. Coupled with lack of any articulated suspicion to justify a nighttime search, these facts made the search unlawful and required suppression of the evidence. To hold otherwise, the court reasoned, would eliminate any requirement that a warrant meet the statutory requirements so long as officers see a clothed, awake person in a dwelling to be searched.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction on the grounds that unlawful nighttime execution of the search warrant required suppression of the evidence seized and that the district court, therefore, erred by failing to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant parked his vehicle near his condominium complex, while he retrieved some items from his home. Defendant parked the vehicle in the western condominium parking lot, to the east of an area that was marked in yellow as a fire lane. Defendant's vehicle was on a concrete sidewalk near the condominium garages. No part of defendant's vehicle was in the area designated as a fire lane. Defendant was ticketed for violating New Brighton, Minn., City Ordinance &sect; 9-41. Defendant argued that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, and that the evidence admitted at trial was insufficient to support his conviction. The appellate court ruled that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague, however, evidence that defendant blocked access to a fire lane was insufficient to support his conviction. A literal reading of the ordinance, and New Brighton, Minn., City Resolution No. 87-107 (adopted Oct. 27, 1987), prohibited only parking in designated fire lanes.
