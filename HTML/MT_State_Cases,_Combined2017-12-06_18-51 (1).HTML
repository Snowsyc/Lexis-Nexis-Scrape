<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of the Eleventh Judicial District, In and For the County of Flathead (Montana) of operating an unlawful clandestine methamphetamine laboratory. Defendant was sentenced to twenty years in prison with ten years suspended with conditions. The court denied his motion for new trial. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by failing to credit defendant with the 264 days he spent on house arrest. The supreme court disagreed. Defendant was not required to wear an electronic monitoring device and was assigned to house arrest as a condition of his release on bond, rather than as a condition of his later suspended sentence. Defendant's release was ordered pursuant to a stipulation and was conditioned by use of the term &quot;formal house arrest.&quot; Defendant argued that the difference in wording and the formal stipulation required sentencing credit. However, though the house arrest was described within the bond release order as &quot;formal,&quot; and was stipulated to by the parties, it nonetheless did not meet the statutory definition of &quot;home arrest&quot; as contemplated in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-203(7)(b). However, the trial court erred by imposing conditions upon defendant's parole release. The parole conditions imposed by the trial court were illegal as being beyond the authority of the court, and were properly challenged on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence was reversed to the extent the conditions imposed by the trial court applied to defendant's parole. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer filed an application for approval of a new site to build six mini-stores in a neighborhood zoning district. When the city commission denied the developer's application, the developer sued appellee City raising several issues challenging the denial of its site plan approval application. The Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, granted the City's motion for summary judgment. The developer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the developer contended summary judgment was improper as the district court relied on disputed facts and the city commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in reclaiming and denying its application. The supreme court disagreed, finding first that a constitutional substantive due process analysis was inapplicable under the facts of this case because the developer did not allege the zoning  ordinance in question was unconstitutional. Further, the record showed that the city commission considered the relevant criteria listed in Bozeman, Mont., Unified Development Ordinance &sect; 18.34.090(A) (including vehicle and pedestrian traffic, parking, wetlands, setbacks, and conformity with the neighborhood) and stated its reasons for deciding that the developer's site plan did not conform to the neighborhood business zoning district. The city commission followed its ordinance in reclaiming and passing on the developer's application by holding a public meeting and unanimously voting to reclaim the application from the planning director to head off of an eventual appeal and protecting public interest and safety.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of storage of salvage. The Thirteenth Judicial District, In and For the County of Yellowstone, Montana, affirmed the conviction. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of Billings, MT, Municipal City Code (BMCC) 27-601(g). The city's counsel presented witnesses about their repeated attempts to work with defendant to clean about his property. Numerous photographs depicting defendant's property were also admitted as evidence. At issue on appeal was: (1) whether BMCC 27-601(g) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant; (2) whether defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel; (3) whether the municipal court erred in denying defendant's motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence; and (4) whether the district court erred in determining defendant's sentence was legal. Additional definitions in the city code diminished the inconsistencies between &quot;permanent storage&quot; and &quot;open storage.&quot; Moreover, there was nothing vague about how the ordinance was applied to defendant. Applying the first prong of the Strickland test, defendant's counsel was reasonably effective. There was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction because witnesses testified that items remained in defendant's yard without moving for more than five days. Finally, the supreme court determined that defendant's sentence was legal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient was a developmentally disabled man in his mid-thirties who had been involuntarily committed and for about half of his life. Appellee State filed a petition to recommit the patient to a residential facility. The First Judicial District Court of Lewis and Clark County, Montana, continued the patient's then current commitment upon a finding that he continued to be seriously developmentally disabled. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the patient raised several issues contending the district court erred in recommitting him. The supreme court disagreed, finding that by stipulating to recommitment, the patient necessarily conceded that there was sufficient clear and convincing evidence to recommit him. As to the patient's challenge to the applicable standard, the supreme court determined that if it adopted the patient's position and imposed the mental illness standard from Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-21-126(2), the most crucial issues in a commitment proceeding, including the existence of developmental disability and cognitive impairment, would still have been determined by a clear and convincing evidence standard. All medical testimony would have met the reasonable degree of medical certainty standard. Thus, the supreme court found no legal or factual reason to conclude that application of the standard of proof advocated by the patient would have protected individual constitutional rights to any greater degree than the present clear and convincing evidence standard. Thus, the district court correctly applied the clear and convincing standard of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of the Third Judicial District, in and for the County of Powell, Montana, that found him not guilty of various offenses by reason of mental disease or defect and that committed him to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services for a period of 10 years, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to defendant's argument, the State contended that defendant's appeal must be dismissed because an appeal could not be taken from a judgment of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. In agreeing with the State's argument, the court ruled that a final judgment of conviction was a prerequisite for appellate review in criminal cases under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-20-104. Defendant was precluded from appealing because there was no judgment of conviction from which to appeal, and the denial of his motion to dismiss based upon a speedy trial violation, absent a judgment of conviction, was not itself an appealable order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted of child molestation in Washington in 1991. While his petition to release him from the Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-504 sex offender registration requirement was pending, he pled guilty to failing to register in exchange for deferred prosecution on an incest charge, which was dismissed. He sought habeas or mandamus relief arguing that a restitution condition violated Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-801.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that the petition was a postconviction petition that was time- and procedurally-barred under Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 46-21-102 and 46-22-101(2). The court found that the claim against the Department of Correction (DOC) failed. Under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-244(6)(a), when an inmate owed restitution, the DOC had to take a percentage of funds deposited in the inmate's account administered by the DOC. The district court correctly refused to relieve the inmate of the registration requirement--his petition was untruthful in representing that he had been law abiding as required by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-506(3) when, in fact, he had been charged with incest while the petition was pending. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim lacked merit: the inmate benefited from dismissal of the incest charges and signed the plea agreement acknowledging an understanding of the consequences. The petition was a postconviction petition. The inmate did not appeal his conviction or file a timely Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-102(1) postconviction relief petition. Regardless of  the petition's character, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-201(2) did not entitle the inmate to appointment of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the inmate's request for appointment of counsel and denied and dismissed his petitions for a writ of habeas corpus or a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 13-year-old juvenile was adjudicated delinquent based upon his sexual abuse of his four-year-old half-brother. The district court placed the juvenile on probation, and although the district court did not require the juvenile to register as a sex offender, the juvenile's probation officer informed him that he would have to do so pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-5-1513(1)(d) (2007), which required a delinquent who had been adjudicated for a sexual offense to register. The juvenile registered before filing a motion to delete that requirement. On review of the district court's order denying the juvenile's motion, the court held that the juvenile was properly sentenced under the amended statute and not the statute that was in effect at the time he committed his offense because the legislature intended the statute to apply retroactively. Further, the judge to whom the case was assigned erred in denying the motion for substitution of judge based upon the juvenile's failure to pay a filing fee because juvenile proceedings were criminal proceedings that allowed a one-time judge substitution, and Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-1-804(1)(d) excluded criminal case from the filing fee requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the district court was affirmed, but a new judge was to preside over any future proceedings in this matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs started a ranch after obtaining a game farm license in 1992. On November 7, 2000, the voters of Montana passed I-143, which prohibited fee-shooting on game farms. Plaintiffs alleged that I-143 was a unconstitutional taking of their private property in violation of the Fifth Amendment and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 29. Defendant, the State Montana, was entitled to a change of venue under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-2-116 by virtue of the presence of multiple claims. The district court did not err by denying the motion to sever claims. Liability for plaintiffs' takings claims was a legal question properly decided by the district court instead of a jury. Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 29 did not provide any greater constitutional protection against the taking of private property than the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court of Montana held that plaintiffs' failed to prove a compensable taking. While I-143 impaired the profitable use of alternative livestock, it still allowed plaintiffs every other use of their alternative livestock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, the owners and operators of alternative livestock game farms (owners), appealed a judgment of the District Court of the Twelfth Judicial District, in and for the County of Hill (Montana) denying their takings claims against defendants, the State of Montana and the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP), on the ground that an Initiative Measure No. 154 (I-143) impaired the profitability of their game farm operations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners held valid alternative game farm licenses issued by the FWP. I-143 prohibited the owners from charging a fee to shoot alternative livestock by altering Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-4-414(2) (2001). The owners contended that, by prohibiting fee-shooting, I-143 eliminated the most profitable use of the alternative livestock and the profitability of their game farms. The owners brought takings claims under the Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 29, and the U.S. Const. amend. V. The district court held that the enactment and enforcement of I-143 did not amount to a compensable taking of the owners' private property because the owners should have reasonably anticipated a measure like I-143. The court found that the district court's findings were not clearly erroneous. First, the owners' licenses were not compensable property interests because they were not transferable, exclusive, or free of any express statutory language precluding the formation of a property right. The court weighed the effects of I-143 and concluded that the owners were not entitled to compensation for the regulatory takings for goodwill and other intangible assets, real estate and fixtures, or alternative livestock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked as a plumber/pipefitter. He filed both a workers' compensation injury claim and an occupational disease claim, asserting hand and wrist injuries. The insurer denied liability. The WCC held the insurer liable for the occupational disease claim. On appeal, the court found that the WCC properly determined that the employee had an employment-related occupational disease, as defined in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-72-102(1) (2003), that might have been exacerbated by a motorcycle accident but was, nonetheless, compensable under the Montana Occupational Disease Act (ODA). The reports of an orthopedic surgeon indicated that the employee's hand and wrist injuries were clearly a preexisting condition occurring before his motorcycle accident and that his hand numbness occurred gradually over time and had gotten worse. The employee's work as a plumber/pipefitter significantly aggravated or contributed to his hand and wrist conditions, as required by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-72-408. The employer, as the employer at the time the employee was last injuriously exposed to the hazard of the disease, was liable under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-72-303.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the WCC. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of the Twenty-First Judicial District, in and for the County of Ravalli, Montana, that convicted him of partner or family member assault, arguing that he was denied a fair trial because of surprise in the introduction of expert testimony by a witness not designated by the State as an expert and that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss a prospective juror for cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for assaulting his wife after his wife reported the assault to the police. After defendant was arrested, his wife also discussed the incident with a county victim advocate. During trial, the State called the victim advocate to testify as an expert, although she was not designated as an expert witness on the State's witness list. On review, the court noted that, while Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-15-323 required a defendant to disclose expert witnesses to the State, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-15-322 only required the State to disclose its witnesses and did not require that the State indicate which were experts. While defendant contended that the discrepancy was unconstitutional, the issue was not reviewable because he failed to raise it before the trial court. The court further concluded that the district court did not err in failing to dismiss a prospective juror for cause under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-16-115(2)(j). Although the juror indicated that he had a predisposition against domestic violence because it affected his wife in her first marriage, he did not voice a predisposition regarding defendant's guilt or innocence and asserted that he could be fair and impartial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, Montana, denying his motion to dismiss the charge of habitual traffic offender operating a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A  police officer stopped defendant's vehicle. A license check indicated that he had been declared a habitual traffic offender and his license had been revoked pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-11-211. Defendant was charged with a violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-11-213, habitual traffic offender operating a motor vehicle. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that his failure to receive notice that he was a habitual offender amounted to a violation of his due process rights. The district court did not err by denying defendant's motion to dismiss. The Supreme Court of Montana held that the government's interest in keeping those drivers who were unable to comply with traffic laws off of public highways justified the immediate revocation of an offender's driver's license. Allowing notice to the offender to become effective upon mailing most efficiently carried out that objective. Therefore, the notice provision of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-11-204 satisfied due process standards. Defendant also had constructive notice of his status as a habitual offender by virtue of his knowledge of his multiple traffic violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment of the District Court of the Eleventh Judicial District, In and For the County of Flathead (Montana), which denied its requested for a preliminary injunction and which ruled in favor of appellee county by finding that an interlocal agreement previously entered into between the city and the county was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into an interlocal agreement. Later, the county issued a resolution unilaterally rescinding the county's consent to the agreement in violation of the express terms of the agreement. The court concluded that the district court erred in its application of Mont.

The error was that both determinations were conclusions resolving the ultimate merits of the case even though the district court was only to make a determination as to the application for the preliminary injunction. The district court erred when it resolved the ultimate merits of the case rather than initially analyzing the propriety of the preliminary injunction under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-19-201. The city was entitled to a preliminary injunction because it made a prima facie showing of the existence of a duly executed contract between itself and the county, and a violation of its rights under the contract by virtue of the county's unilateral decision to breach the agreement.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued, inter alia, that the provision of the Sexual and Violent Offender Registration Act requiring an offender to report a change of residence was void for vagueness; the 1999 version of the Act as applied to defendant deprived defendant of his constitutional right to due process of law because the Department of Corrections (DOC) set his sexual offender risk level without notifying him or giving him an opportunity to contest the designation. The supreme court concluded that defendant was denied his right to due process of law when DOC designated him as a level 3 sex offender because defendant did not have the opportunity to know what information was used to designate his risk level, defendant had no right to contest that information, and he had no ability to argue for a different designation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant conviction for failure to register as a sex offender was affirmed. Defendant's level 3 sex offender designation is was vacated, and this matter is remanded to the district court for a hearing to appropriately determine defendant's sex offender level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions for two felony counts of sexual assault, one felony count of sexual intercourse without consent, and one misdemeanor count of sexual assault, but the supreme court affirmed. The victims were his girlfriend's children. While the supreme court did not condone the prosecutor's comments, it declined to invoke plain error review of defendant's claims because the comments did not rise to a level sufficient to invoke the doctrine. The prosecution did not comment upon defendant's post-Miranda silence, but instead offered personal opinions as to the credibility of the witnesses and the significance of defendant's failure to present evidence. Such comments did not have the effect of unconstitutionally shifting the burden of proof to defendant. Defendant did not receive the ineffective assistance of counsel since he failed to show that the prosecution instructed or suggested to a victim how a question should be answered and that, had counsel's objection been timely made, the district court would have concluded that the question was leading and would have been disallowed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother was sentenced to prison as a result of her involvement in a botched armed robbery.

In the instant petition, the mother alleged that she has been deprived of her right to parent the child because of the amended petition for termination of parental rights and for adoption filed by the relatives. The supreme court held that the case met the requirements for the exercise of supervisory control. The relatives were not authorized by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 42-1-107(2) to place the child for adoption. Further, the child's relatives were not authorized under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 42-2-603(2) to petition for the termination of parental rights. Also, the relatives did not have standing to terminate parental rights based on abuse or neglect of the child. Further, the district court wrongly interpreted Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-6-233. The district court erred in determining that the relatives had standing to bring a petition for termination of parental rights; however, the district court should appoint the relatives as guardians, pursuant to Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pointed to no caselaw demonstrating that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-404(2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to defendant. Moreover, the trial court apprised the jury that evidence of the refusal to submit to a test to detect alcohol or drugs was a permissive, not conclusive, presumption that defendant was intoxicated. Additionally, upon reviewing the jury instructions as a whole, it was evident that the trial court informed the jury that the State had the burden of proving all the elements of the offense charged against defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, the trial court did not abuse it discretion in limiting defendant's questioning of a trooper under the Sixth Amendment and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 24, preventing him from asking about the machine used to administer breath tests and the results that could occur. Also, because the rebuttable presumption in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-404(2) was constitutional and did not shift the burden of proof to defendant, it was not improper for the prosecutor to comment upon it and defendant's right to a fair trial was not undermined. Finally, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor went through an extensive process to get his license in Montana because of discipline problems that he had in other states. The deceased had an appointment with the doctor and died before he could follow up. The widow claimed that the State should not have given the doctor his license. The trial court found that the decision of the Montana Board of Medical Examiners was protected by quasi-judicial immunity. The court held that, regardless of whether the Board's actions in investigating the doctor's license application and granting him temporary and permanent medical licenses were discretionary functions, its actions were not undertaken in the context of a controversy or adversarial proceeding as contemplated by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-15-102(10) and thus the Board was not entitled to quasi-judicial immunity for its actions in granting a medical license to the doctor. However, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 37-3-101 (1997) did not create a special relationship between the State and the deceased giving rise to a special duty. As a result, the statutory special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine did not exits and the State did not owe a duty of care to the deceased.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, even though the court found the trial court's reasoning to be incorrect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the District Court of the Twentieth Judicial District, in and for the County of Lake (Montana), which denied his motion to set aside the revocation of his probation for failure to register as a sex offender and denied his petition for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on probation, defendant was arrested several times for various offenses. His probation officer reported all but one of them as probation violations, and he was jailed briefly. Defendant did not assert a violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-1012(4) on direct appeal. The court held that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-105(2) did not bar defendant's claim that his probation was revoked in violation of the procedures set forth in &sect; 46-23-1012(4); because subject matter jurisdiction was not affected, the State waived the procedural bar of &sect; 46-21-105(2) by raising the issue for the first time on appeal. The court concluded that the term &quot;arrest&quot; in &sect; 46-23-1012(4) was limited to the specific types of arrests that &sect; 46-23-1012(2) permitted a probation officer to initiate; thus, proper procedure was followed when a violation report was made within 10 days of the probation officer's issuance of a warrant, but more than 10 days after an arrest. Due process was adequate without a preliminary probable cause hearing. Although double jeopardy precluded revocation based on violations for which defendant had been jailed and released, the previously unreported offense sufficed for revocation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted after confidential informants purchased drugs from them while being electronically monitored and recorded. Defendants motions to suppress the recordings made of their conversations with the informants, arguing that the recordings, which were made without a warrant and without their knowledge or consent, violated their constitutional rights, were denied. On appeal, the court held that the electronic monitoring and recording of defendant's conversations with the confidential informants, notwithstanding the consent of the informants, constituted searches subject to the warrant requirement of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 11 because defendants had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the conversations they had with the informants in their homes and vehicle. The electronic monitoring and recording of the conversations without a warrant or the existence of an established exception to the warrant requirement violated defendants' rights under Mont.

Defendant and the victim had a three-year relationship, but the relationship had ended ten years before the alleged assault. The City countered that the definition of partner under Mont.

Defendant appealed his conviction to a district court and asked for a trial de novo, and the district court convicted defendant after the charge was tried to a jury. The state supreme court affirmed. All errors committed by the justice of the peace were cured when defendant was provided with a trial de novo in district court, defendant waived his right to a speedy trial under Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner justice of the peace filed an original petition for declaratory judgment with the court against respondent board of county commissioners, challenging the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-10-101(5), which provided for the creation of justice's courts of record within Montana counties. The State intervened pursuant to Mont. R. App. P. 27.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In accordance with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-10-101(5) the board passed a resolution making the existing county justice court a court of record. The justice argued that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-10-101(5) violated Mont. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, because justice courts were a specifically-designated constitutional court entitled to constitutional protection. The justice argued that the Legislature could create additional courts, but it could not abolish constitutional courts. The court rejected the justice's argument. Nothing in &sect; 3-10-101(5) indicated an intent to abolish existing justice courts; rather, the statute gave counties a choice of whether they want their justice court to be one of record. The justice next argued that the elimination of de novo trials following appeal from justice's courts of record violated Mont. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(2). The court held that the phrase &quot;unless otherwise provided by law&quot; in art. VII, &sect; 4(2), gave the Legislature the ability to provide for something other than de novo appeals in district courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was injured during the course of his employment while attempting to assist the driver of a vehicle stuck in a ditch. The insured incurred $ 18,405 in medical expenses. He received workers' compensation benefits for all but $ 1,175 of the expenses. He had two automobile policies with the insurer. The policies provided medical coverage of $ 5,000 per policy. The insurer paid the remaining $ 1,175. The insured brought an action against the insurer, seeking outstanding medical payment benefits in the amount of $ 8,824. The trial court granted the insurer's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court found that the workers' compensation provisions in the automobile policies were not ambiguous and did not violate public policy. The insurer was only required to pay the difference between the total medical expenses and the amount required to be paid by the workers' compensation fund. While it was reasonable for the insured to expect that his policies would pay his medical expenses once the workers' compensation fund had paid all it was required to pay, it was not reasonable for him to expect to receive funds in excess of his medical expenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and wife challenged a decision of appellee Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services that affirmed a decision of the Montana Board of Assistance as to the wife's Medicaid eligibility. The District Court of the First Judicial District, in and for the County of Lewis and Clark (Montana), affirmed the decision. The husband and wife appealed the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision to include the husband's ownership interest in a trucking corporation in the resource application as a countable resource under the no corporation, no trust rule violated the couple's equal protection rights under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4, where the DPHHS failed to explain why the goal of cost control was served by allowing limited liability companies an exclusion of property in some situations, while denying outright any exclusions for property held in a corporate or trust form. The district court also erred in upholding the decision to deny the wife the ability to use her post-eligibility income to pay for nursing home care expenses incurred prior to her Medicaid eligibility because it was contrary to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' decision that services incurred prior to Medicaid eligibility had to be considered &quot;not a Medicaid covered service&quot; so long as they were not actually covered by Medicaid. However, the decision not to offset the couple's countable resources by the amount of their accumulated nursing home care expenses was affirmed as there was no legal authority to support the contention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed as to the conclusion that the inclusion of the husband's interest in the trucking corporation was a countable resource that did not violate the equal protection of the laws.

The case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) filed a petition for adjudication of children in need of care and temporary legal custody of two children. The District Court of the Ninth Judicial District, in and for the County of Teton (Montana), terminated the parental rights of the biological mother and father. The father appealed the termination of his parental rights to his biological son.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that no youth in need of care (YINC) adjudication had occurred and that he had not stipulated that his biological son was a YINC. A YINC adjudication was not required for the DPHHS' temporary investigative authority petition where the father and mother had admitted that their children had been abused and neglected in the treatment plans they entered with the DPHHS. However, the district court erred in concluding that the children had been adjudicated YINC as no adjudication had occurred. Nonetheless, the error was harmless where the father was represented by counsel, stipulated in subsequent proceedings that the child was abused and neglected, and the evidence of abuse and neglect was overwhelming. Moreover, the father neither challenged the evidence of abuse and neglect, argued that he was misled during the subsequent proceedings, nor contended that those proceedings were fundamentally unfair. A reversal would also have had devastating effects on the child's rights under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 15, and best interests.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-404(2), and that its wording unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to him. The District Court of the Ninth Judicial District, in and for the County of Toole, Montana, overruled the objections. Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Defendant was sentenced. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court violated his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 17 by implying to the jury through the instruction that he was required to present evidence rebutting his refusal to submit to a breath test. The court found that the instruction, when viewed in context with the other jury instructions, did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to defendant because another instruction made it unmistakably clear that defendant was innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that he was not required to present any evidence at trial. The 1995 amendments to DUI statutes did not constitute an ex post facto law under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 31. The 1995 amendments simply put defendant on notice that if he violated the DUI statute and had prior DUI or BAC convictions which were not expunged those prior violations could elevate a future DUI conviction to the level of a felony. As a result, it was not an ex post facto law, and the district court did not err in including defendant's 1992 BAC conviction for sentencing enhancement purposes.</SPAN></P>

Further, no statute required or authorized a trial court to award credit for time served on house arrest prior to conviction or while released on bond, regardless of the formal nature of the house arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of felony issuing a bad check. The trial court deferred imposition of sentence for a five-year period on each count. The State later filed a petition to revoke the deferred sentences. The trial court sentenced defendant to prison. The trial court also ordered him to pay $ 654 for the costs of counsel appointed to represent him in the revocation proceeding. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court imposed an illegal sentence when it ordered him to pay the costs of his court-appointed counsel. The court found that the trial court's imposition of the costs was within the parameters of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-8-113(1). The trial court's alleged failure to abide by the requirement of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-8-114 that it specify in its written judgment that payment of counsel costs be made to the Montana Office of the State Public Defender rendered imposition of the costs merely objectionable, not illegal. Defendant failed to present a colorable claim that his sentence fell outside statutory parameters and warranted review under the Lenihan rule. Consequently, the court declined to consider his arguments raised for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended, inter alia, that the jury instruction derived from Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-404(2) violated his right against self-incrimination and due process rights as it undermined the other instructions regarding the State's burden of proof and placed on defendant the burden of having to prove his innocence by giving a breath test. The supreme court disagreed, finding first that defendant's conclusory assertion that &sect; 61-8-404(2) was &quot;unconstitutional on its face&quot; was a wholly inadequate presentation of an issue. Further, nothing about the instruction required the jury to infer from defendant's refusal that he was under the influence. To the contrary, the jurors were told that they &quot;may&quot; infer from his refusal that he was under the influence. The jurors were also instructed that defendant was presumed innocent, that the presumption was not overcome unless, from all the evidence, they could find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that defendant was not required to prove his innocence. As such, the jury was fully and fairly instructed regarding the applicable law and burden of proof was not unconstitutionally shifted to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended the district court erred by limiting his right to voir dire the jury to 15 minutes; the district court abused its discretion by allowing police officer testimony pertaining to the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test; and the inference contained in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 61-8-404(2) violated his due process rights. The supreme court held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the time-limit as it engaged in a comprehensive voir dire before turning the jury over to counsel, and counsel had the opportunity to engage in a colloquy with the jurors. However, the supreme court agreed that the State failed to establish the necessary foundation for admission of the officer's testimony on the HGN results or the inference he drew from these results; further, the State failed to meet its burden of proving that this admission was harmless. The inference in question was permissive and did not violate due process in that there was a rational connection between driving while intoxicated and refusing to take a sobriety test. Defendant had the opportunity to present evidence or argument to rebut the presumption, but did not do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the district court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the DUI charge because his 1996 DUI conviction was invalid and could not be used as the basis for a charge of felony DUI. The court held that the district court did not err by denying defendant's motion to dismiss because it correctly held that the 1996 conviction could be used as a prior conviction to support the felony DUI charge, as the State presented sufficient oral and documentary evidence to support the conclusion that the 1996 conviction was not entered in violation of defendant's right to be present at the trial. The evidence showed that defendant appeared in court on April 22, 1996 and entered a plea of not guilty, that a public defender was appointed to represent defendant, that defendant stayed sufficiently in contact with the public defender to have her move to continue the August 30, 1996 trial due to defendant's health problems, and that defendant either knew of the November 20, 1996 trial date and was willfully absent or kept himself deliberately ignorant of the trial date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient argued that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-21-126(1)(d) was unconstitutional because it purported to allow involuntary commitment based on the mere possibility that an individual's condition may worsen to a point where he posed a threat of harm to himself or others. The supreme court noted that the patient did not present his challenge to the constitutionality of the statute to the district court. The supreme court found that the district court's determination that the patient's mental condition would likely deteriorate if left untreated was not clearly erroneous. The State was not required to prove that the patient's mental condition would deteriorate if left untreated. There was substantial credible evidence that there was an imminent threat of injury to the patient. In light of the non-hearsay testimony received regarding the patient's mental disorder, the incorporation of the State's expert's report into the district court's order was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, in and for the County of Cascade, Montana, imposed a restitution sentencing condition following defendant's conviction of the offense of arson.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the sentencing condition (1) was illegal under applicable statutes, (2) was an unconstitutionally excessive fine for which he sought plain error review, and (3) violated his right to due process because one could not be required to pay restitution at a rate greater than one could reasonably bear. Defendant's arguments on appeal were not raised in the district court. Indeed, no objections were made to the restitution condition. The court found that defendant's due process claim was premature because nothing of record indicated that defendant's suspended sentence was revoked for failure to pay restitution despite his good faith efforts. The restitution defendant was ordered to pay was within statutory parameters because restitution was statutorily required. The other claimed errors did not go to the legality of the sentence, but only to alleged statutory errors. Thus, defendant's claims were not within the exception to the requirement that claims for review of a sentencing issue must first have been raised in the district court by way of an objection. Finally, the court declined to exercise plain error review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the State of Montana and the Montana Public Employee Retirement Administration, appealed two orders from the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County (Montana), which concluded that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 19-13-210(2) violated the equal protection rights of plaintiff, a National Guard firefighter hired before October 1, 2001, and awarding attorney fees and costs to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 19-13-210(2) differentiated between two similarly situated classes of employees, i.e., Guard firefighters who were hired on or after October 1, 2001, and who could participate in the firefighters retirement system, and those hired before the cut-off date who remained in the public employee retirement system. Plaintiff belonged to the latter group. On review, the supreme court noted that constitutional provisions against discrimination did not forbid statutes and statutory changes to have a beginning, and thus to discriminate between the rights of an earlier and later time. The alleged distinction would end once all Guard firefighters hired before October 1, 2001, retired. The statute represented a legislative choice to provide a prospective retirement solution for all newly hired Guard firefighters without affecting the retirement expectations of existing Guard firefighters. The statute operated equally upon members of each class of firefighters. The legislative approach to correcting a &quot;long standing inequity&quot; between Guard firefighters and other firefighters did not violate plaintiff's right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court orders granting summary judgment and awarding attorney fees and costs to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The non-consensual sex went beyond any reasonable conception of sexual harassment and fell outside the Montana Human Rights Act's definition of discrimination in employment. The allegations of non-consensual sex sounded in tort and not in discrimination. While the guardian sought relief for discrimination in the Department of Labor and Industry, she also sought relief in the district court for tortious conduct. When the Human Rights Commission held that she had not stated a cognizable claim for discrimination, she was free to pursue relief for the alleged tortious conduct in district court, so long as her claim was not grounded upon underlying allegations of discrimination. Since the claims sounded in tort, the guardian was not barred by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 49-2-509(7) (2001) from proceeding in district court. However, she was barred from proceeding on her discrimination claims against the restaurant chain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Eighteenth Judicial District, in and for the County of Gallatin, Montana, rendered judgment against appellant insurer pursuant to Mont. R. Civ. P. 54 on appellees', estate personal representatives (estate), suit for damages from an August 2002 automobile accident in which the decedents were killed. The district court held that the estate could stack all three underinsured motorist (UIM) policies. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found that the insurer waived its right to argue the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction. The insurer's participation in the court proceedings constituted a voluntary appearance under Mont. R. Civ. P. 4B(2), thus admitting the jurisdiction of the district court. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the insurer's motion to stay the proceedings in Montana until the North Dakota declaratory judgment was decided. Montana law applied to the stacking and coverage issues as Montana was where the accident occurred and the damages arose. The basic elements of res judicata were satisfied by the North Dakota rulings. However, the district court did not err in declining to accord full faith and credit to the rulings issued by the North Dakota courts as the judgment in North Dakota was brought for the purpose of preempting the district court in Montana from exercising control over the judicial processes necessary to resolve the dispute. Collateral estoppel did not preclude the estate from litigating its UIM claims in Montana. Principles of comity did not require Montana courts to defer to the rulings from the North Dakota Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Second Judicial District, County of Silver Bow, Montana, granted the motion of plaintiff, a health care facility (the facility), to permanently enjoin defendant, a physician who formerly headed the facility's radiology department (the physician), after determining that the facility met its burden under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-19-201. The physician appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician maintained that the injunction was an unconstitutional prior restraint on his right to free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (f), were not infirm because these paragraphs were all pinpointed precisely toward forms of speech and conduct which were not constitutionally protected. Paragraph (d), however, swept too broadly and was stricken since it did not prohibit conduct which was embarrassing, annoying, or harassing. Paragraph (e) also was overbroad insofar as it enjoined discouraging conversation between the physician and potential candidates for the position of head of the radiology department; on the other hand, portions of paragraph (e), which enjoined the physician from &quot;intimidating&quot; speech and conduct, were not constitutionally protected. Also, (1) sufficient evidence justified enjoining the physician from the harassing and intimidating conduct described in the injunction; (2) the facility had standing to seek a protective order for certain third parties; and (3) injunctive relief was available to the facility even though money damages were available to remedy the alleged harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in issuing paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (f) of the injunction; however, the district court did manifestly abuse its discretion in issuing paragraph (d) and a portion of paragraph (e). Consequently, the district court's action was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-703(5) was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sustained a permanent neck injury in the course and scope of his employment as a part-time school bus driver. He worked principally as a farmer and was unable to return to farming. The State Fund denied the claimant permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits after he achieved maximum medical improvement pursuant to &sect; 39-71-703(5) on the ground that he had suffered no actual wage loss from his bus driving job, as he returned to work and earned the same wage. The trial court held that the statute was constitutional because it properly distinguished workers with actual wage loss from workers without actual wage loss in awarding PPD benefits. On appeal, the court held that although there were several similarities between the classes, a difference existed, namely actual wage loss. This difference was fundamental in light of the legislature's declaration that the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost as a result of work-related injury or disease. The distinguishing factor also related to the underlying justification of &sect; 39-71-703(5).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged an order from the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County (Montana), terminating his parental rights to his infant child. The issues on appeal were whether the termination, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-3-609(1)(d) and 41-3-423(2)(e), violated the father's constitutional right to due process and whether the district court abused its discretion in terminating the father's parental rights to the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father previously had his parental rights involuntarily terminated to all five of his other living children due to his inability to parent. While an adjudication hearing was not required, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-609(1)(d) still required a determination that the child was abused or neglected. The statutory scheme did not deprive the father of due process because the district court still had to determine that the child was at substantial risk of harm. The state had to show that the father had his parental rights involuntarily terminated to the child's siblings and that those terminations were relevant to his ability to parent. The father failed to meet his burden of showing that the lack of an adjudication hearing in a Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-609(1)(d) proceeding was unconstitutional. The statutory scheme did not create a presumption against the father as the burden to show the child was at risk remained on the state. The State established by clear and convincing evidence that the father had his parental rights to all five siblings involuntarily terminated, and that the circumstances related to those terminations were relevant to his inability to care for this child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the district court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens group filed suit against appellee Board of Adjustment, challenging a decision by the Board to issue a conditional use permit (CUP) to allow appellant property owner to extract and crush gravel on the owner's land. The owner intervened, arguing that the CUP was too narrow in scope. The Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, Montana, granted summary judgment to the Board. The group and the owner both appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the group contended the district court erred in concluding the issuance of the CUP was lawful under the zoning regulations; the owner contended the district court erred in concluding that under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-209, the Board could issue a CUP which prohibited asphalt and concrete batch operations. The supreme court disagreed with the owner, finding that the zoning regulations and the neighborhood plan at issue demonstrated that the district had been specifically zoned to promote and regulate residential use and was a &quot;residential&quot; district for purposes of &sect; 76-2-209, even though the district permitted other uses. Thus, the Board was authorized to prohibit concrete and asphalt batch operations. However, the supreme court also agreed with the citizens on their points, finding, inter alia, that the Board abused its discretion in issuing the CUP because it failed to provide a factual foundation for its decision, other than a belief that compliance with unspecified Department of Environmental Quality regulations would automatically be sufficient to discharge its duties under the local zoning regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's conclusion that the Board had the power to prohibit asphalt and concrete batch plant operations in the CUP was affirmed; the district court's conclusion that the Board did not abuse its discretion in issuing the CUP was reversed, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information with a felony DUI and failure to carry personal liability insurance. At trial before the District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District, In and For the County of Yellowstone, Montana, defendant moved to suppress evidence. Defendant was ultimately convicted on both counts. Defendant appealed the district court's denial of his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer saw a pickup stopped on a dirt pull out, within plain sight of the road. The officer noticed defendant and his girlfriend kissing inside the truck, and the officer became concerned that the couple was about to engage in inappropriate sexual behavior. The first issue presented on appeal was whether the district court erred in concluding that there was no particularized suspicion to justify the officer's initial seizure of defendant. Once the officer activated her emergency lights, defendant was seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 11. Any particularized suspicion which arose did so only after defendant was seized. Moreover, the officer did not approach the vehicle because she believed a crime was being committed, as Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-5-401(1) required. The second issue presented was whether the district court erred in concluding that the community caretaker doctrine provided a justification for the officer's seizure of defendant. The supreme court declined to extend the doctrine to include an exception that would allow an officer to detain a person based on solely personal dissatisfaction with the person's conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed the district court's conclusion that the officer did not have particularized suspicion for her investigative stop of defendant. The supreme court reversed the district court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress. The matter was remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal.

The Supreme Court of Montana held that appellant's challenge to the trial court's admission of evidence was procedurally barred by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-105(2). Appellant's claim that due process required reversal of his conviction due to the trial court's erroneous admission of the other crimes/acts evidence was not preserved for review. Appellate counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to raise on appeal the issue of whether the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the State to present other crimes/acts evidence at trial.

Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-501, et seq. (2005), he lived in his father's house in a municipality in which all mail was delivered to post office boxes. Defendant registered as his address his post office box rather than the address of his father's house. Defendant later began to reside at his girlfriend's house in the same municipality, although he maintained a room at his father's house and occasionally slept there. Defendant retained the same post office box as his mailing address. The appellate court, referring to U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 17, held that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-505 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the particular circumstances of defendant's case; because the statute's text did not require defendant to register using a residential address, he did not have actual notice, from either the statute or the officials enforcing it, that a mailing address was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

The City moved for a change of venue based on the pretrial publicity. The Three Forks City Court granted the motion for a change of venue and ordered the case transferred to Madison County. The jury convicted him of one count and acquitted him on three counts. On appeal, the Gallatin County District Court erred in remanding the case back to the Three Forks City Court for a new trial. A trial de novo in the district court pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-17-311(1) was the only remedy to which defendant was entitled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant utility claimed that appellee Montana Department of Revenue (DOR) deprived the utility of constitutional equal protection when it assessed the utility's property taxes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility acquired most of a power company's electric generation assets as part of Montana's deregulation of its electric power industry. DOR determined, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-23-101(2), that the utility was operating a single and continuous property in more than one county. DOR centrally assessed the utility's newly acquired property. The utility challenged the assessment. The State Tax Appeals Board (STAB) determined that DOR had calculated properly the intangible personal property exemption and the value of the property. STAB then adjusted down the fair market value of the property for all three years. At issue was whether the property tax assessment deprived the utility of constitutional equal protection. The federal Equal Protection Clause did not prevent a State from assessing taxes on a company's property based on the use to which a company put those assets in its larger system or business. The outcome would be the same under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4. The supreme court could not conclude that DOR treated the utility differently. The supreme court could not conclude under these circumstances that STAB's finding was clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a legal guardian and a mother, sued defendant United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit certified the following: (1) whether the standard in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 23-2-653 (1996) violated Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4, (2) if so, did the standard in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 70-16-302(1) (1996) apply, and (3) if not, did Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-701 apply?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guardian alleged that the incapacitated person was injured when the Forest Service failed to correct or warn of a danger posed by a hill. The appellate court certified questions of law to the court regarding the proper standard of care. The court first found that gross negligence provision in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 23-2-653 (1995) was overbroad and violated the Montana Equal Protection Clause under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4. The court had previously found that the skier responsibility statutes under Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 23-2-731 - 23-2-737 violated equal protection guarantees and the court discerned no difference between the snowmobile liability statute's purpose and the skier responsibility statute's purpose. The court struck only those provisions of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 23-2-653 that applied a gross negligence standard of care and the court left intact the remainder of the statute. The willful or wanton misconduct standard of care in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 70-16-302(1) had no application under these circumstances. The general statutory duty of due care set forth in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-701 provided the standard of care to govern the Forest Services' actions in this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered yes, no, and yes, respectively, to the three questions certified to the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse without consent with a 15-year-old.

The plain language of &sect; 46-23-509(4), when construed with its applicability provision, stood for the proposition that level III sex offenders convicted on or after August 21, 2002, could not petition for re-designation of their sex offender status.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen claimed damage stemming from a justice of the peace's wrongfully issued arrest warrant against him. The trial court granted the county summary judgment and the court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the citizen was not able to avoid the application of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-112, which codified the doctrine of judicial immunity. The citizen was not free to challenge the statute's constitutionality for the first time on appeal. The justice of the peace's issuance of the warrant constituted a judicial act for purposes of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-10-401 and the execution of the warrant represented the judicial power of the State put into action. The grant of the citizen's motion to withdraw a guilty plea and the remand of that case to the justice court also constituted judicial acts, for purposes of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-20-703, and the failure of the county courts to remand the matter constituted an omission as opposed to an affirmative judicial act. The acts and omissions that led to the citizen's arrest fell within the immunity afforded to the county under Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised certain issues on appeal, but the court affirmed and remanded for the entry of an amended judgment. The court agreed with the State that the $ 50 fee imposed in defendant's sentence for the &quot;cost of prosecution&quot; was actually imposed to pay the cost of defendant's court-appointed defense counsel, and thus was not improper under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-8-113(1). Although the trial court's written judgment referred to the fee imposed as a &quot;cost of prosecution,&quot; this did not accurately identify the purpose for which the fee was really imposed. The record showed that the fee was clearly for the purpose of reimbursing the cost of defendant's two public defenders, but the fee was incorrectly termed a &quot;cost of prosecution.&quot; The entry of an amended judgment in this regard was ordered. Although defendant claimed that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-6-101(2) was unconstitutional under Apprendi, this rule did not apply to the imposition of restitution, and thus the trial court did not err in ordering defendant to pay restitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a criminal appeal, defendant claimed that the district court erred in ordering him to repay the costs of his appointed counsel because Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-8-113 violated the equal protection clauses of the United States and Montana Constitutions. The Supreme Court of Montana disagreed. Defendant failed to establish that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-8-113 resulted in different treatment of similarly-situated individuals. Contrary to defendant's claim, individuals ordered to pay recoupment costs as a condition of a felony criminal sentence were not similarly situated to civil judgment debtors. The process of adjudicating a civil judgment generally did not include determinations that the judgment debtor committed a criminal offense against the State and its people, that the public purse was expended to defend the judgment debtor, or that the judgment debtor had the ability to pay the debt. Therefore, defendant's equal protection challenge failed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate challenged a decision from the District Court of the Ninth Judicial District, in and for the County of Toole (Montana), which, in response to the inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, sentenced him to six years in the Montana State Prison (MSP) after finding that an illegal sentence had been previously entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was sentenced to six years in the Montana Department of Corrections (DOC). In a petition seeking habeas corpus, he alleged that his six-year commitment to the DOC violated Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-201(3)(d)(i). The trial court then entered a six-year sentence in the MSP. This appeal followed. In reversing, the appellate court held that the inmate was allowed to use habeas corpus proceedings in order to attack the illegal sentence given originally, pursuant to Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 19. The procedural bar to such a challenge set forth in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-22-101(2) was found to be unconstitutional in the Lott case. Next, the inmate did not waive his right to challenge the sentence. The State did not object to the challenge at the time the petition was filed; also, it admitted that the sentence was illegal and stated that the proper remedy was re-sentencing. Finally, the inmate's due process rights were violated because a sentence to the MSP was more burdensome. Nothing in the record indicated that the trial court based the more burdensome sentence on objective information concerning identifiable conduct of the inmate after the original sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision was reversed, and the case was remanded for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-221(1)(1985). He argued that a weapon enhancement for use of a weapon violated the double jeopardy clause. He also contended that the writ of habeas corpus could never be suspended, and thus he could raise this issue some twenty-one years after imposition of the original sentence in 1986. The Supreme Court of Montana held that the habeas claim was barred by res judicata. Petitioner had already filed a postconviction challenge to the weapon enhancement. Furthermore, the collateral attack on his conviction and sentence was barred by the applicable five-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 9.68A.090. He was ordered to register as a sex offender in Washington. In October 2005, the Montana Legislature amended Montana's Sexual and Violent Offender Registration Act, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-23-502(6), so that offenders had to register in Montana if they had to register for an offense in some other jurisdiction. In November 2005, defendant was implicated in a Montana crime and charged with felony failure to register as a sexual offender. Defendant was not entitled to dismiss the charge. The offense for which he was convicted in Washington was equivalent to the sexual abuse of children under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-625. A youth offender was required to register, and the 2005 amendment to the Act was retroactive. The supreme court held that the Act did not violate Mont. Const. art.

The insurance company refused to provide MPC in excess of that contained in the Escort's policy, because the insureds were not operating or occupying the other two vehicles at the time of the accident.

Although the applications particularly described the items to be seized, the warrants themselves did not. The district court ordered the return of all items seized pursuant to the warrant. Later, the State submitted a second round of warrant applications. A substituted judge had the jurisdiction to issue the second search warrant. The evidence necessary to show probable cause was obtained from a source independent of the first search, and thus met an exception to the exclusionary rule. Defendant was not entitled to suppress items seized pursuant to the second search warrant. The district court gave sufficient unanimity jury instructions on the counts charging defendant with the promotion of prostitution and sexual abuse of children. The district court did not prevent defendant from presenting a mistake of age defense to the charge of sexual abuse of children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidates were not invited to participate in gubernatorial debates.

The candidates failed to present a viable claim of political discrimination for purposes of 42 U.S.C.S. 1983, and thus they had to first exhaust available administrative remedies before pursuing a state law discrimination claim. The court affirmed the dismissal of candidates' action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and common law conspiracy because the complaint (1) failed to allege that the candidates were members of a suspect class, (2) failed to allege that the system conspired for an illegal purpose, and (3) was void of any facts that would have sustained a claim under the Act. The trial court properly dismissed the candidates' claim on behalf of minors because the candidates lacked standing to assert the constitutional rights of others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmates challenged a decision of the District Court of the First Judicial District, in and for the County of Lewis and Clark (Montana), which granted summary judgment to respondents, officials of the Montana Department of Corrections, on claims for injunctive and declaratory relief. Appellant prisoner challenged an order granting summary judgment to the officials on his related claims. The court consolidated the cases for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates sought a judgment that persons sentenced to the Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge (MSP) prior to 1999 had to be confined there and other private prisons did not have the same opportunities, thus rendering the inmates' incarceration unlawful. The prisoner sought to be transferred back to MSP and placed in a low security classification. The trial court granted summary judgment to the officials and the court affirmed. The court held that any differences between medical care, visitation, education, and recreation at MSP and the private and regional prisons, as authorized under Mont. Code Ann. tit. 53, ch. 30, pts. 5, 6, did not rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 22 and the Eighth Amendment. The inmates did not provide evidence that the officials acted with deliberate indifference. The court also found no state constitutional violation under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The inmates did not possess a state-created liberty interest in being housed at MSP. While the prisoner had a liberty interest in the opportunity for parole, the officials did nothing to impede those opportunities and the court found no constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured party challenged a decision from the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, in and for the County of Missoula (Montana), which granted summary judgment in favor of respondent State in an action arising from a car accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party contended that the State's contractor failed to place adequate signs at a road construction zone. After summary judgment was granted to the State, this appeal followed. In affirming, the supreme court rejected the assertion that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-9-301 was unconstitutionally vague. A person of ordinary intelligence could have comprehended that the term &quot;receipt&quot; meant that the statute of limitations tolled when the claim was actually received. The fact that &quot;receipt&quot; could have varied by the manner of delivery did not render the statute unconstitutional since perfect clarity and precise guidance were not required. Next, the district court's application of &sect; 2-9-301 was proper. Since the claim was received on April 26, 2004, tolling began the next day, pursuant to M.R. Civ.P. 6(a). The limitations period resumed on August 25, 2004, which was 120 days later. The limitations period expired at the end of that day because the injured party had only one day left in the three-year period when the claim was received. The complaint filed the next day was untimely. If the tolling period began on the mailing date instead, the outcome would have been the same.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff art appraiser sued defendants, a law firm, an attorney, and his client, for malicious prosecution and abuse of process. The jury found in favor of plaintiff and awarded $ 1.1 million in compensatory damages. The jury assessed punitive damages for $ 20 million against the law firm. The District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, County of Cascade, Montana, reduced the sanction against the firm to $ 9.9 million. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff rendered his opinion that a watercolor painting the client owned was not authentic. The client hired an attorney to file a defamation action against plaintiff. The district court dismissed the suit with prejudice, because defendants could not prevail on the merits. Plaintiff incurred over $ 45,000.00 in legal fees. He filed a successful suit for malicious prosecution. The district court reduced the jury's award of punitive damages against the law firm from $20 million to $9.9 million. The state supreme court examined the penalty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-221(7)(a), the district court properly admitted evidence of defendants' financial condition during the punitive damages proceedings. The law firm failed to object to the district court's instruction to the jury that it could be held liable for the attorney's actions. Defendants were not harmed by the jury instructions regarding the theories of liability. Because the law firm did not have a history of this kind of misconduct, calculation of the punitive damages award based on a single-digit multiplier comported with due process concerns.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owned a bar in Poplar, Montana. During an investigation, officials arrested an individual who admitted that he had delivered methamphetamine to appellant at her bar. The county attorney and the U.S. attorney advised the task force that appellant's bar was subject to forfeiture. Without a warrant, an agent for the task force seized the bar, the contents therein, and appellant's liquor license. The district court ruled that probable cause existed for the seizure of appellant's property. After the bar was destroyed by a fire, the district court dismissed the petition for forfeiture. However, the district court denied appellant's petition for the release of her property. On appeal, she challenged whether the district court erred in determining that probable cause existed for the seizure of her property. The issue was moot, as there was no justiciable controversy before the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with resisting arrest and obstructing a police officer.

The municipal court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to dismiss and the district court did not err in affirming that determination. The municipal court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a directed verdict. The district court did not err in its failure to inform defendant of the potential pitfalls of proceeding pro se. He never waived his right to counsel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate appealed the judgment of the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Montana, denying his amended petition for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury found appellant guilty of aggravated assault, and the criminal possession of dangerous drugs and drug paraphernalia. The time between appellant's arrest and the first trial date amounted to 267 days, and from his arrest to the trial amounted to 372 days. Appellant's requests for continuances and his counsel's motion to withdraw were the cause for 169 days of the delay. Appellant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating impairment in his ability to defend himself. Counsel was not ineffective for his failure to file a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial; nor was counsel ineffective for failure to move for a directed verdict or for failing to object to the jury instruction on aggravated assault as a lesser included offense of attempted deliberate homicide. At sentencing, the district court's failure to submit the issue of a weapons enhancement to the jury was harmless error; appellant was not illegally sentenced. The district court did not err by denying his request for postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant former employee challenged a decision of the District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District, in and for the County of Yellowstone (Montana), which granted appellee former employer attorney fees and its motion for judgment as a matter of law and held that the employee's violation of a grazing policy was good cause for termination under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-904(1)(b), (c) of the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was fired for violating a grazing policy. He brought this action under the Act, Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-2-901 - 39-2-915, but the trial court ruled in the employer's favor. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that it was going to review a trial court's grant or denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law as a legal question for which the de novo standard was appropriate. Those decisions, including Wallin v. Kinyon Estate, 164 Mont. 160 (1974), and any other decisions, including Somont Oil. Com. v. A. &amp; G Drilling, Inc., 332 Mont. 56 (2006), Glacier Tennis Club v. Treweek Const., 320 Mont. 351 (2004), Onstad v. Payless Shoesource, 301 Mont. 259 (2000), In re Mental Health of D.L.T., 314 Mont. 297 (2003), Buhr on Behalf of Lloyd v. Flathead County, 268 Mont. 223 (1994), Nelson v. Flathead Valley Transit, 251 Mont. 269 (1992), and Davis v. Sheriff, 234 Mont. 126 (1988), applying an abuse of discretion standard of review, were overruled to that extent. The trial court erred in granting the employer's motion under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-904(1)(b) because a jury might have found the employer lacked good cause to discharge the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The trial court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law regarding the employee's argument under the first section of the statute in question, but the trial court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law under the second section of the statute. The court vacated the award of fees and did not address another of the employee's contentions. The court remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with speeding, driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, and possession of an open alcohol beverage container. He sought a waiver of a jury trial and argued that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-17-201 (2005) was unconstitutional to the extent that it required both parties to consent to the waiver. The justice court erred by declaring the statute unconstitutional and granting defendant's request for waiver of a jury trial over the State's objection. Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 26 required the State's consent prior to the waiver of a jury trial. This case was appropriate for the exercise of supervisory control. The appeal process would have provided an inadequate remedy, because the State would have lost its right to consent or object to the waiver of a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient presented several issues on appeal of her commitment order, including her attorney's alleged ineffectiveness, the constitutionality of Montana's civil commitment statutes, and the authority of the district court to order involuntary medications based on the testimony of a licensed clinical professional counselor. The patient did not raise these issues in the district court. The Supreme Court of Montana would not review the issues, because they were outside of the record. The patient's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was based on a medical journal article and a record of complaints that was not part of the district court record. There was no basis in the record for the Supreme Court of Montana to vacate her commitment after the fact, declare certain statutory provisions unconstitutional, and adopt guidelines for future involuntary medication cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District, in and for the County of Yellowstone (Montana) of aggravated assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised many issues on appeal, none of which had merit. Because defendant raised justifiable use of force as an affirmative defense, it was defendant's burden at trial, and the State was not obligated to prove that defendant did not act with such justification. Therefore, the trial court properly instructed the jury to that effect, and the court agreed that a statement in State v. Azure, 181 Mont. 47 (1979), which approved a jury instruction that placed the burden on the State to establish the absence of justification of use of force, was no longer good law. The trial court did not err in enhancing defendant's sentence, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-221(1) for use of a weapon, where he was found guilty of aggravated assault under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-202 and he was separately found by the jury to have used a weapon in the commission of the offense. The application of the enhancement statute was not a violation of the double jeopardy principles in Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. As defendant was only charged with one criminal offense, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury regarding unanimity. Evidence was properly excluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, an education association and two teachers, challenged a decision of the District Court of Thirteenth Judicial District, in and for the County of Yellowstone (Montana), which, after dissolving a stay of the proceedings, ordered petitioner school district to release documents to respondent newspaper under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9. The newspaper challenged the denial of fees under Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2-3-221, 27-8-313.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After having found that the teachers lacked an expectation of privacy in the documents sought, the trial court ordered the release of the documents to the newspaper. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the association and teachers failed to utilize procedures to preserve the ability to appeal the trial court's finding of no expectations and the trial court's order releasing the documents, the association and teachers were not entitled to use the &quot;capable of repetition, yet evading review&quot; exception to the mootness doctrine. Because the issues were rendered moot by the trial court's order releasing the documents, the court declined to address the merits of the issues. The trial court did not err in denying the newspaper's request for attorney fees. For purposes of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3-221, the newspaper was not a plaintiff who prevailed according to the statute. The district's seeking a judicial determination of the issues did not serve to automatically subject the district to pay an award of fees under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-8-313. The court found no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's children were adjudicated as youths in need of care, making his prior convictions relevant. The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) learned that he had a 1985 sexual offense involving a minor in Texas. The father had subjected a child to one of the aggravated circumstances listed in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-423(2)(a)-(e), by reason of his adjudication for indecency with a child. Based upon the aggravated circumstance, DPHHS was not required to provide rehabilitative services. This was not an unlawful retroactive application of the statute.  The father's children were in the State's custody for 29 months preceding the hearing, creating a presumption that the termination of parental rights was in their best interests under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-604. The district court's termination order was not clearly erroneous. The father's motion for judgment as a matter of law was not properly before the court.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-61-201, 37-61-210. Appellant had never been licensed to practice law in Montana or any other state, he did not attend law school, and he did not sit for Montana's bar exam. On appeal, the court held that the district court did not err by finding that appellant engaged in the unauthorized practice of law because his conduct of drafting pleadings for his customers, providing them with legal advice, and appearing in court with his customers constituted &quot;practicing law&quot; under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 37-61-201. Appellant readily admitted that he did so without having received a license to practice law under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 37-61-210. The court further held that &sect;&sect; 37-61-201, 37-61-210 were constitutional because they were narrowly tailored to target only the provision of legal services in Montana by individuals who had not proven through examination and admission to the bar that they were qualified and possessed a familiarity with Montana law. The statutes also provided fair notice of the prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the habeas proceeding, the petitioner challenged the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-22-101(2)(2003), suggesting that the statute, by prohibiting a petitioner from challenging the validity of a sentence, impermissibly suspended the writ of habeas corpus. Since petitioner's challenge drew into question the facial validity of his sentence, the state supreme court concluded that the procedural bar to his habeas corpus petition was not applicable and addressed the merits of his claims. The district court did not violate petitioner's constitutional rights when it declared him ineligible for parole while serving a life sentence; nor did the court violate his constitutional rights when it designated him a &quot;dangerous offender&quot; for all purposes. Petitioner was not entitled to relief from the ten-year weapons enhancement added to his sentence by the district court. Petitioner's conviction became final long before the United States Supreme Court decided Apprendi; the case did not apply retroactively on collateral review.</SPAN></P>

The inmate raised a facial challenge to the sentence and contended that the sentencing court had no authority to impose an enhanced sentence for the use of a firearm under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-221(1) (1997) for the reason that the inmate was convicted of assault on a peace officer under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-210(1)(b) (1997). As applied to the inmate's challenge to the validity of the enhanced sentence, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-22-101(1) (1997) unconstitutionally suspended the writ of habeas corpus and there was no procedural bar to the court's entertaining the inmate's facial challenge. The inmate was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The inmate had pointed a gun at policemen but did not shoot. The offense constituted causing apprehension of serious bodily injury to a peace officer by use of a weapon and the use of a weapon was required. Therefore, the enhancement of the sentence was in violation of a later case and was illegal, such that relief was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The inmate sought a writ of habeas corpus under MCA &sect; 46-22-101 challenging those sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that the district court unconstitutionally enhanced his sentences in violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy under the decisions in the Guillaume and Whitehorn cases, which were decided after the inmate was sentenced. The State argued that the inmate was not entitled to relief because habeas corpus was not available to attack the validity of his sentence, as he had not filed a direct appeal or postconviction petition, and the one-year statute of limitations for seeking postconviction relief under MCA &sect; 46-21-102 had expired. The court held that the inmate was entitled to habeas corpus relief because the district court unconstitutionally enhanced the inmate's sentences because the offenses required proving the use of a weapon in violation of the inmate's double jeopardy rights, and because the procedural bar created by MCA &sect; 46-22-101(2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally suspended the writ of habeas corpus. Had the inmate filed a timely direct appeal or petition for postconviction relief, his double jeopardy argument would have been unavailing because the decisions on which he relied were not issued until well after both filing dates had expired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The proponents attempted to place three initiatives on the November 2006 ballot. The opponents filed suit, alleging that the proponents engaged in signature gathering practices that violated state law. The district court agreed and invalidated the initiatives' certifications. On appeal, the court affirmed. The district court did not err when it determined that the signature gathering process was permeated by a pervasive and general pattern and practice of fraud and procedural noncompliance. The opponents presented uncontradicted evidence that the five most prolific signature gatherers swore to signatures obtained outside of their presence in violation of MCA &sect;&sect; 13-27-302, 13-27-111(4). Substantial evidence was presented that the affiants provided bogus or false addresses for where they could be contacted in violation of MCA 13-27-302, evidence that was not rebutted. The district court's finding that a significantly large percentage of the paid, out-of-state signature gatherers working for the proponents' employed a &quot;bait and switch&quot; tactic to induce people who knowingly signed one petition to unknowingly sign the other two was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The senator requested the release of state tax information on corporations.

Petitioner's request for a writ did not comply with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-25-202, which required more than general allegations. Petitioner also sought a writ of mandate pursuant to Mont.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee and cross-appellant, the Montana State Fund, appealed an order of the Montana Workers' Compensation Court (WCC) related to common fund attorney fees and the retroactive application of the Stavenjord rule that an employee should receive benefits related to her occupational disease equal to benefits she would have received had she been injured.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The WCC determined that application of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-72-405(2)(1997) to the employee's claim against the State Fund violated her constitutional equal protection rights. The employee was entitled to receive benefits related to her occupational disease equal to benefits she would have received had she been injured. The State Fund paid the employee's additional benefits. The employee then sought retroactive application of the Stavenjord rule, and the recovery of common fund attorney fees for Stavenjord-type benefits secured by non-participating claimants. An analysis of the Chevron factors revealed that retroactive application of the Stavenjord rule was proper. There was no reason to create a distinction between litigants based on the timing of their claims. Stavenjord did not create a common fund. Thus, the employee's counsel was not entitled to recover fees from cases brought by other claimants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the WCC for further proceedings to include the determination of an appropriate procedure by which potential Stavenjord beneficiaries could be identified and notified of their interests related to increased Stavenjord-type permanent partial disability benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, in and for the County of Missoula (Montana), of deliberate homicide in violation of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-102 (2001). He was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant challenged the parole restriction. The court affirmed. The trial court's imposition of a parole eligibility restriction pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-202(2) (2001) did not violate defendant's constitutional rights under the Sixth Amendment. Because the State did not seek the death penalty, and because neither Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-219 nor Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-222 was applicable to defendant's case, the maximum sentence that could have been imposed on defendant for deliberate homicide was life imprisonment. The parole eligibility restriction imposed on defendant fell within the statutory range for the offense. The court rejected defendant's claim that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-102(2) contained an implicit presumption of parole eligibility. The trial court's restriction on defendant's parole eligibility did not violate defendant's statutory rights under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-1-401. Mont. Code Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 45-5-102(2) authorized a district court to impose both life imprisonment and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and thus Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-202(2) did not allow or require a sentencing court to increase punishment for a charged offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspaper appealed the judgment of the District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District, In and For the County of Yellowstone, Montana, which determined that all documents requested by the newspaper should be disclosed by respondent county with some redactions, and denied the newspaper's request for costs and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper sought access to public documents held by the county concerning civil litigation brought against county officials. The county filed a declaratory action seeking a determination of which documents had to be disclosed. The district court authorized disclosure of the chief public defender's deposition testimony with redactions. The public's right to know about his management of the public defender's office outweighed any privacy interest non-parties may have had in the redacted portions of his testimony. Therefore, the public had a right to inspect the entirety of his deposition so long as the names of the non-parties were withheld. The district court erred in denying the newspaper's motion for attorney fees without rationale. Due to the public benefits gained by the vindication of the public's right to know, the costs of litigation to secure these rights should have been spread among beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's authorization of redactions which eliminated more than non-party names from the chief public defender's deposition testimony was reversed, and the case was remanded for further consideration of the newspaper's request for attorney fees and entry of an order thereon with supporting rationale.</SPAN></P>

City of Havre, 2005 Mont. Dist. LEXIS 1017 (2005)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff newspapers sued defendants, a city, a police chief, and police members, seeking an unredacted incident report and an order to implement a general related policy of dissemination. The District Court of the Twelfth Judicial District, in and for the County of Hill (Montana), denied the newspapers' default judgment motion, granted defendants summary judgment, and granted the newspapers fees under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3-221. All appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspapers sought an unredacted incident report, which defendants originally refused to give. After the newspapers filed this lawsuit, defendants gave the requested information to the newspapers. The trial court ultimately ruled in defendants' favor on summary judgment, but awarded the newspapers fees. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and remanded. The trial court did not err in denying the newspapers' motion for a default judgment. Defendants' summary judgment motion sufficed to prevent the trial court from entering a default judgment. The newspapers' request for prospective relief lacked any concrete factual basis and was a request for relief from a purely hypothetical future violation of its right to know under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9. This was an unripe and nonjusticiable controversy. Because the issue related to the release of the report was mooted after the newspapers obtained receipt thereof, the trial court should have dismissed the case instead of granting summary judgment. For purposes of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 2-3-221, the newspapers were entitled to recover only those fees incurred in securing the unredacted reports.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' cross-appeal was not ripe. Fees incurred in securing the unredacted report were proper. The court affirmed and remanded for a hearing to determine those fees. Any other fees incurred, including those to obtain prospective relief, were not recoverable. The court remanded for dismissal the claims without prejudice, as the trial court should have done this rather than grant summary judgment. Denial of default judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged a decision of the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, in and for the County of Cascade (Montana), which, on a petition filed by respondent Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, terminated his parental rights to two children.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that no treatment plan was necessary because the father was not able to assume the role of parent. On appeal, the court affirmed the termination decision. The father failed to tie the proposition that parent-child bonds were not to be lightly disregarded to the jury trial right he asserted under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 26. The adoption of the father's argument would have required the court to overrule case law and Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-3-607(5), which provided that there was no right to a jury trial in termination of parental right proceedings. Two psychologists testified that the father would not be able to parent within a reasonable time and another testified that someone would have to be with the father every minute for months or more to get him to function adequately as a parent. The trial court found that the accommodations necessary to keep the children safe were beyond the scope of the Americans with Disabilities Act, even if it applied in this case, and the father failed to establish error in the trial court's rejection of his claim that the Department violated the Act under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 12132 by failing to accommodate his mental illness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a trial for DUI, the State offered an instruction under Mont.

Defendant contended that this inference improperly placed the burden of proof on him. In affirming, the appellate court determined that it had decided the exact same issue in the Great Falls case. Section 61-8-404(2) was read as requiring the production of other competent evidence of a DUI since &sect; 61-8-404(1)(a) required corroborating evidence when a person actually took a test.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on citizen complaints and other information known about a person staying at defendant's residence, a search warrant was issued. A motion to suppress evidence found in the search was denied, and defendant was convicted. In partially affirming, the appellate court determined that the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; test was used to evaluate whether probable cause supported the issuance of a warrant. It was proper to consider information that the person staying at defendant's house was involved in methamphetamine use, along with suspicious activity at the residence, in determining whether probable cause existed. The proposition that independent police work represented the only method of corroboration under the totality of the circumstances test was wrong as a matter of law. Next, defendant's Batson challenge was properly denied because of the race neutral explanations provided by the prosecutor: one potential juror was related to defendant, and the other one considered his attorney a good friend. Finally, a remand was necessary as to the sentence imposed because the record did not show that the criteria under Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&nbsp;46-18-225 was considered.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, in and for the County of Missoula (Montana), entered a judgment for the State on a jury verdict after denying the State summary judgment and excluding evidence of a prior accident, a maintenance contract, and another's alleged negligence and conduct. The parents and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' daughter was killed in a motorcycle accident. The parents brought an action, but the trial court entered a judgment on a jury verdict in the State's favor. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for a new trial. The trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of a prior accident because it was relevant to the question of the State's notice of the road's conditions as well as to questions of road defect and causation. Thus, the court remanded for a new trial. Because many questions presented on appeal were likely to arise again, the court addressed other issues raised. The plain language of Mont. R. Evid. 615 demonstrated that Rule 615(2) permitted a validly designated representative to both remain in the courtroom during the trial and testify. Consequently, the court overruled State v. Flowers, 320 Mont. 49 (2004) and State v. Claric, 271 Mont. 141 (1995), to the extent that the court stated that a valid designated representative under Rule 615(2) could not both remain in the courtroom during trial and also testify. One witness, as a former State employee, did not qualify as a proper representative under Tex. R. Evid. 615(2) at retrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for a new trial. The trial court erred in excluding evidence of the prior accident, refusing to permit the introduction of a maintenance contract, and excluding the introduction of another's conduct to establish the victim's alleged negligence. The trial court did not err in denying summary judgment and in refusing to allow the jury to consider another's alleged negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a decision of the District Court of the Twentieth Judicial District, in and for the County of Lake (Montana), which (1) entered an order granting a motion to dismiss filed by defendant and (2) dismissed the State's appeal from a justice court order that dismissed the State's case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and appeared in the justice court. The matter was set for an omnibus hearing that the State did not attend. The justice court dismissed the action. Instead of refiling in the justice court, the State filed a notice of appeal in the trial court regarding the dismissal order. The trial court dismissed the appeal and the charge against defendant. The court affirmed. The State had to file the charge against defendant in the justice court and had no power to file the complaint first in the trial court, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-10-303(1)(a) and Mont. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5(2). Defendant had an absolute right to two jury trials, one in the justice court and one in the trial court. The State, by not participating in the justice court proceedings, was not permitted to deny defendant's rights to a jury trial in both courts, and thus the trial court's decision was proper. To the extent an accused was legally entitled to prosecution in one or more courts, then he was, under Mont. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 24, 26, also entitled to have those facts found by a jury in each court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he purposely hit the victim during a barroom brawl; therefore, the first element of aggravated assault was undisputed.

At trial, the victim complained of sharp shooting pains in his head and double-vision; he also stated that three teeth were loosen. The new testimony was immaterial; therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's motion for a new trial based on allegations of perjury. Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a continuance on the second day of trial when he received the victim's undisclosed medical records. The aggravated assault statute,&nbsp;Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-202(1), was not misleading or unconstitutionally vague. As used in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-2-101(66), the terms &quot;protracted&quot; and &quot;impairment&quot; were not obscure or incomprehensible.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to fifty years in prison with twenty years suspended. He filed a petition for postconviction relief. Five of appellant's claims could have been raised on direct appeal, and therefore were procedurally barred. Counsel acted reasonably in deciding not to object to the portion of appellant's sentence resulting from his designation as a persistent felony offender under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-13-108. The elements of proof required for conviction of possession of precursors to dangerous drugs under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-9-107, differed from those required to prove production of dangerous drugs under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-9-110. Therefore, appellant's double jeopardy claim was meritless. Counsel did not err in refusing to move to dismiss the criminal endangerment charge for lack of evidence. The Supreme Court of Montana issued a memorandum opinion affirming the denial of postconviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged a decision of the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, in and for the County of Cascade (Montana), which awarded respondent grandparents contact with the mother's daughter, pursuant to the grandparents' petition for contact under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-9-102(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the relationship between the parties deteriorated, the mother forbade all contact between the grandparents and the child. The trial court ultimately awarded the grandparents contact with the child, but the court reversed and remanded on appeal. The court held that, for purposes of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-9-102(2), grandparent proceedings had to being with the presumption that a fit parent acted in the child's best interest, and the statute's best interest standard, as enacted, remained intact as the standard by which a grandparent's request for contact had to be judged. The court did not declare the statute to be unconstitutional. In this case, there was no indication that the trial court inquired into the mother's fitness as a parent, and the trial court failed to accord the mother's wishes any deference. Thus, the trial court failed to apply the correct analysis and remand was required. Given that the mother's appeal was a request for a proper delineation of parental rights, not whether the best interest standard under the statute was unconstitutional, the court did not address another argument that claimed the mother's appeal was procedurally barred.</SPAN></P>

While the denturists had a fundamental right to pursue denturity as a profession under Mont. Const. art.

Appellants' claim under the Montana Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act (MUTPA), Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 30-14-205(2)(c), failed as a matter of law. The BOD was not subject to MUTPA.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS), appealed the judgment entered in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, Montana, requiring DPHHS to provide community-based services to respondent, an adult male with a developmental disability. The district court held Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-20-132 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found respondent to be &quot;seriously developmentally disabled&quot; as defined in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-20-102(15) (1999), and committed him involuntarily to the Montana Developmental Center. One month before the end of his commitment, the residential facility screening team, acting pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-20-133, and under DPHHS's authority, determined respondent was no longer seriously developmentally disabled. Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-20-132 did not prohibit the court from ordering the provision of community-based services. In the event Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-20-132 did prohibit such an order, the statute was unconstitutional because it violated respondent's rights to due process, dignity, equal protection, and speedy remedy for every injury. Given respondent's placement in community-based services, the case was moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the assault on his wife. She did not testify at trial, but her neighbor, the 911 operator, and the responding officer did. Defendant had objected to the hearsay statements on the ground that they denied him the right to confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI, but the trial court admitted the statements. Defendant was convicted and the court affirmed on appeal. The court held that generally, when a declarant knowingly spoke to a government agent, the statements were presumed testimonial. Because the 911-taped statements that defendant had hurt his wife were admitted without objection, the operator's testimony and the officer's testimony about the same actions, even if objectionable, were cumulative and thus harmless error. As to the neighbor's testimony about what defendant's wife said, given that the wife was in distress and addressing a non-governmental agent, she had no objective reason to believe or anticipate that her statement was going to be used in court. The wife's statement was non-testimonial, the admission of the neighbor's hearsay testimony did not offend the Confrontation Clause, and was admissible under Mont. R. Evid. 803(2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant environmental group challenged a decision of the District Court of the First Judicial District, in and for the County of Lewis and Clark (Montana), which granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and Montana Board of Land Commissioners, regarding the group's claim that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 77-1-202 (2003) required harvest-specific accountings. The group sought attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group challenged the Board's methodology in evaluating timber sale transactions and claimed that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 77-1-202(1) (2003) required accountings that were harvest-specific. The trial court rejected the group's challenge and ruled in favor of the Department and Board, and the court affirmed on appeal. In interpreting &sect; 77-1-202(1) in accordance with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 1-2-101, the court noted that the plain language of the statute did not require the accountings suggested by the group. Other statutes, including Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 77-1-223, 77-1-224, required the Board to account for costs and profits in the timber-sale process, and in light of the explicit accounting directives in these statutes, the court could not conclude that the Montana Legislature meant to imply a more specific accounting requirement within Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 77-1-202(1) (2003). The court held that a harvest-level accounting of timber sales was not implicit within &sect; 77-1-202(1), and the Board was not in violation of the statute when it did not conduct harvest-level financial reconciliation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient challenged a decision of the District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, in and for the County of Missoula (Montana), which denied her motion for injunctive and declaratory relief against respondent State. The trial court found that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-20-132 was constitutional and the patient was not entitled to immediate placement in community-based services after her involuntary commitment expired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient was ordered involuntarily committed for one year to receive treatment and habilitation. The patient filed a motion for declaratory and injunctive relief, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court did not err in finding that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-20-132 was constitutional. The patient's challenge to the statute as an unconstitutional bar to services and the courts, for purposes of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 16, was flawed partially because it did not recognize that the statute worked with the administrative process. In light of Mont. Const. art. XII, &sect; 3 and the patient's narrow focus of challenge, the court found that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-20-132 was facially constitutional, and the patient's claim, that the statute barred her only remedy, was inaccurate, given that it ignored administrative remedies she could have pursued to address her claim of delayed placement. The court was unable to determine whether the patient's individual constitutional rights, such as privacy, were violated as a result of the delay in her placement in community-based services because she did not exhaust her administrative remedies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During plea negotiations, the State apparently offered to recommend a sentence of 20 years on the assault charge, with an additional five years suspended for the use of a dangerous weapon. Defendant rejected the plea and later entered an open guilty plea. At the sentencing hearing, the State recommended a sentence greater than the one it earlier offered to recommend. Defendant argued that this violated his right to due process. The court disagreed on appeal and affirmed. The State's sentencing recommendation to which defendant objected did not occur during proceedings on retrial. The State, after defendant rejected the plea agreement, was free to proceed with the case and make any legal sentencing recommendation because no agreement to the contrary had been reached. When defendant entered his guilty plea, the trial court informed defendant of the 30-year maximum possible sentence. With no plea agreement in place, the State was not prevented from recommending the maximum sentence. There was no due process violation as claimed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a three-count complaint alleging that defendant had wrongfully failed to award plaintiff's radio stations a contract for exclusive radio broadcasting rights to MSU athletic events. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint as a matter of right pursuant to Mont. R. Civ. P. 15(a). The district court denied plaintiff's first motion to amend, because the new tort claim had not been presented to the Montana Department of Administration. The district court properly dismissed plaintiff's second motion to amend; the additional claim challenging the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 18-4-242, which limited remedies under the Montana Procurement Act, was futile and legally insufficient. Plaintiff's second motion to amend the complaint to allege a declaratory judgment claim was a thinly veiled attempt to avoid Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 18-4-242(7).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent retired teacher challenged the statutory scheme governing the eligibility for public pensions of employees who worked for a local school district, retired, and then began work at the University of Montana.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher retired from her position with the school district, and then accepted a position with the University of Montana. Her employment with the University triggered the application of two inter-locking provisions of Montana's teacher retirement system: Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 19-21-202 and Mont. Admin. R. 2.44.305. These provisions prevented a retired teacher from receiving retirement benefits from a state sponsored retirement program while he remained an employee of the University and a contributing member of another private retirement program. The Supreme Court of Montana held that the statutory scheme did not violate the teacher's right to equal protection. The district court erred by concluding otherwise. The teacher was given an opportunity to make an election of benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's determination was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted, designated as a persistent felony offender, and sentenced to 10 years, with five years suspended. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer observed defendant driving erratically and pulled him over. A preliminary alcohol screening test revealed defendant's blood alcohol content (BAC) to be 0.274. The State charged defendant with fourth offense DUI. The State presented sufficient evidence supporting the reliability of the preliminary breath test (PBT) to permit the results of defendant's test as substantive evidence at his trial. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting statements that defendant made to police during an investigatory stop in spite of the officer's failure to recite the advisories required by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-5-402(4)(2001). Defendant uttered the statements &quot;just give me a DUI,&quot; and &quot;I'm already drunk,&quot; without any prompting by the investigating officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group contended that the land board violated the Montana Constitution and breached its duty of trust by the commingling of trust assets into the general fund and the sale of a future stream of mineral royalties from school trust land in exchange for an immediate cash infusion. After judgment was entered against the group, it sought review. In affirming, the court determined that the commingling of interest income under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 17-6-202(2) did not necessarily mean that any duty had been violated. The land board accounted for the exact amount of interest and bonuses deposited into the general fund. Further, the enactment of Mont. Senate Bill 495, 2001 Mont. Laws 418, partially codified at Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 17-6-340, did not violate the Montana Constitution and the Enabling Act, Act of February 22, 1889, &sect; 11, ch. 180, 25 Stat. 676 (1889) because it did not abrogate the requirement to obtain full market value for school trust lands. The district court did not err by finding one expert witness on the issue of valuation more credible. Finally, the interests of the present and future beneficiaries were balanced when the sale of the future mineral royalties was conducted.</SPAN></P>

The district court did not err by adopting the plan. Given that Mont.

Code Ann. &sect; 45-6-201(1). Defendant raised several claims on appeal. Mont. Unif. Mun. Ct. R.

Defendant's claim that the method of jury selection violated his right to trial by jury was not preserved for review. Jury instructions regarding criminal trespass correctly stated the law; and jury instructions on entrapment were not required. The criminal trespass statute was not vague or overbroad.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mining companies sued defendant, the State of Montana, alleging that Montana Initiative 137 interfered with their rights to mine property leased from the State. The District Court of the First Judicial District, County of Lewis and Clark, Montana, granted the State's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs appealed the district court's order denying their takings, contract impairment, and lease termination claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1986, the State of Montana leased six state properties for mining purposes. In one of the largest areas, a mining company operating as a joint venture discovered 9 million ounces of gold, and 20 million ounces of silver, which could be profitably recovered through a surface mine combined with cyanide leaching of the ore. In 1998, the citizens passed Montana Initiative 137 (I-137), which prohibited cyanide leaching for mining purposes. The district court held that I-137 did not effectuate a regulatory taking, because the joint venture had not secured an operating permit giving it the right to mine. While the law substantially impaired the contractual relationship between the joint venture and the State, the Contracts Clause was not violated; I-137 was reasonably related to the legitimate purpose of protecting the environment. The Department of Natural Resources and Conservation was not obligated to extend the mineral leases to give the joint venture time to seek the invalidation of I-137.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an insurer and the Montana State Fund, challenged a decision of the Workers' Compensation Court (Montana), which held that (1) the rule that the Occupational Disease Act was unable to allow apportionment deductions in certain instances was retroactive, (2) a common fund was created, (3) respondent employee's attorneys were entitled to common fund fees, and (4) the common fund did not create a global lien. The employee also appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held in Schmill v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp. that under an equal protection analysis, the Occupational Disease Act (ODA) could not allow for apportionment deductions for non-occupational factors if the Montana Workers' Compensation Act (WCA) did not allow for such deductions. The trial court found that this rule was retroactive. The court affirmed in part on appeal. The court agreed that the rule announced in Schmill was retroactive. The court found that the lower court had jurisdiction to award common fund attorney fees, given Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-2905. The common fund did not arise until after the court issued the Schmill decision, and therefore it was proper for the employee's attorneys to wait until post-remand proceedings to request common fund attorney fees. The attorneys were not now estopped from requesting common fund attorney fees and there was no due process violation. The court held that the common fund created in Schmill applied a global lien against all claimants who might have benefitted from the decision, not just those whose benefits were paid by the insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the Schmill decision was retroactive to all cases not yet final or settled at the time of its issuance. The attorneys properly requested common fund attorney fees and the common fund did result in a global lien. The court did not disturb the finding that Schmill created a common fund.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a plea of guilty to felony theft. The offense was committed in December of 1996. He was committed to the Department of Corrections (DOC), for ten years with all time suspended. In 2003, defendant's suspended sentence was revoked and he was resentenced under the new law. The reimposed prison sentence was more burdensome, because it required defendant go to prison. The district court's application of the 2003 version of Mont.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 46-18-203(7)(b), 46-18-401(1)(a) required that defendant be given sentencing credit for time spent in a detention center or on home arrest on concurrent sentences entered in Yellowstone County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee filed a workers' compensation claim. The Workers' Compensation Court, Montana, denied the claim under the Occupational Disease Act of 1985. The employee challenged the ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was diagnosed with asbestosis; one year later, he decided to retire at the age of 62. Years later, the asbestosis had grown much worse. The issues presented on appeal were: (1) whether the Workers' Compensation Court (WCC) erred in concluding that he was not entitled to permanent total disability (PTD) benefits; (2) whether the WCC erred in concluding that he was not entitled to 500 weeks of permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits; and (3) whether the WCC erred in concluding that he was not entitled to an impairment award. The WCC found that, while still capable of working, the employee voluntarily retired for reasons unrelated to his occupational asbestos disease. The WCC's ruling was properly based on the lack of causal connection between the claimed loss of wages and earning capability, and the illness. Even if the supreme court were to accept as true the employee's contention that he was 100 percent disabled because he had no earning capability in his labor market, the fact remained that his decision not to work again had been both long-standing and resolute. The supreme court also affirmed with respect to the claim for PPD benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer detected the odor of alcohol when he stopped defendant. At trial, defendant objected to the admission of the weekly field certification report on the intoxilyzer prepared by another officer, the yearly certification report, and the state crime lab report. Two issues were presented on appeal: (1) whether the appeal was properly before the supreme court; and (2) whether defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was implicated when the State introduced a certification report for a breath analysis instrument without also providing the author of the report for cross-examination? The supreme court held that the matter was properly before it, although the second issue had not been raised below; relevant caselaw was recently decided by the United States Supreme Court. The decision in this case turned on the issue of whether the certification reports were properly categorized as testimonial or nontestimonial evidence. The supreme court agreed with the State that the certification reports were nontestimonial evidence because they did not fall within the core group of statements which the Confrontation Clause was meant to address. The Sixth Amendment was not implicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a coalition of schools and parents, contended that appellant state had acted unconstitutionally in administering and funding Montana's constitutionally-mandated public school system. The state appealed from the order of the District Court of the First Judicial District, County of Lewis and Clark (Montana) that determined that Montana's public school system violated the public schools clause, Mont. Const. art. X, &sect; 1(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state argued that the Supreme Court of Montana could not reach the issue of whether the current school system violated art. X, &sect; 1(3), because the issue was a political question. The supreme court concluded that, since the legislature had addressed the threshold political question by implementing art. X, &sect; 1(3), the question whether the system it created violated the constitution was not a political question. The requirement that the legislature should provide a basic system of free quality public schools, had to be read in conjunction with art. X, &sect; 1, which guaranteed a right to education. Thus, the issue was justiciable and the supreme court affirmed the district court's determination. As the final guardian and protector of the right to education, it was incumbent upon the supreme court to assure that the system enacted by the legislature enforced, protected, and fulfilled the right. But, the legislature had not defined what &quot;quality,&quot; as used in art. X, &sect; 1(3), meant, thus the court could not conclude that the current system was designed to provide a &quot;quality&quot; education. Therefore, the supreme court deferred to the legislature for the definition of &quot; quality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opinion of the district court was affirmed in part. The effective date of the district court's opinion was affirmed. The issue of attorney fees was vacated and remanded and the issue was remanded for reconsideration. The district court's conclusion that the system did not violate the equal protection clause of the Montana Constitution was vacated.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of the Twelfth Judicial District, In and for the County of Hill, Montana, sentenced defendant to the Department of Corrections for eight years, with five years suspended. Among other conditions of release to probation or parole, defendant was ordered to submit to DNA testing. Defendant appealed the DNA testing requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered into a plea agreement with the State in which he agreed to plead guilty to the crimes of burglary, theft, and forgery by common scheme. On appeal, defendant argued that it was unconstitutional to force someone convicted of and incarcerated for non-violent felony offenses to submit to DNA testing. Defendant argued that this violated his right to privacy, as well as his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. He did not, however, refute the State's assertion that he did not object on the search and seizure grounds in the sentencing court. Thus, this argument was not properly before the court. On the issue of whether the DNA test would violate defendant's right to privacy, it was unclear to the court whether defendant intended his argument to be construed as a constitutional challenge to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 44-6-103 (2003). Assuming that he did, the court could not make such a determination on the basis of the abbreviated arguments before it. Pursuant to &sect; 44-6-103, a person convicted of a felony was required to submit to DNA testing. Defendant was convicted of a crime which met the definition of a &quot;felony offense.&quot; Thus, his sentence was not illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, challenged orders of the District Court of the Second Judicial District, Butte-Silver Bow County (Montana) that held respondent was not seriously developmentally disabled, concluded that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-20-132 was unconstitutional, and ordered the Department to provide respondent with appropriate individualized community-based developmental disability services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was a developmentally disabled adult diagnosed with personality disorders due to a childhood near-drowning incident that caused neurological damage. Respondent was committed to the state residential facility based on a report that he had sexually assaulted his three-year-old niece. When the Department petitioned for another one-year commitment term, the trial court found that respondent was not seriously developmentally disabled and ordered that he be provided with individualized community-based services. On appeal, the court held that the record of the hearing was devoid of any evidence that respondent could be &quot;safely&quot; habilitated in the community; therefore, the trial court erred in concluding he was not disabled. The court held that because respondent could not be safely habilitated in the community, he was seriously developmentally disabled as defined in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-20-102(15). The court noted that it was undisputed that respondent had behaviors which posed an imminent risk of serious harm to himself or others, that he needed constant supervision and structure, and that if placed in community services he could voluntarily refuse treatment and medication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court orders that held respondent was not seriously developmentally disabled. The court did not address the issue of whether the statute, which provided that a court could not order the placement of or delivery of services to a developmentally disabled person in community-based services, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a petition of delinquency against defendant, a juvenile. The petition arose out of an alleged beating resulting in death and serious injury. The State then filed in district court a notice of its intent to transfer the case to district court. The Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, Big Horn County, Montana, entered a decision to allow prosecution of defendant's case in district court. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State alleged that defendant, using a baseball bat, beat and killed one victim and severely injured another victim. At the time, defendant was 13 years old. The district court eventually assigned to the State the burden of proof under the transfer statute. Defendant asserted that the district court contemplated only selective factual allegations, proposed by the State and adopted verbatim by the court, that falsely portrayed the nature of the alleged incident. The supreme court concluded that the district court made comprehensive findings of fact that intimately detailed the testimony offered at trial. As to defendant's allegations of clear error, the district court received testimony at trial from both parties concerning the interests of the community and of defendant. The supreme court concluded that substantial credible evidence supported the findings that probable cause existed for the charge of deliberate homicide and thus prosecution in district court under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 41-5-206(3)(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed an order of the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, In and For the County of Cascade (Montana) that granted defendant railroads' motion for a change of venue pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 25-2-122(2) and 25-2-201(1) in the employee's action to recover for injuries under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 51.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed that the Legislature did not intend Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-2-122(2) to apply to FELA cases; that &sect; 25-2-122(2) could not coexist with the liberal forum selection policy under FELA; and that &sect; 25-2-122(2) was unconstitutional because it constituted an arbitrary and capricious limitation on FELA venue practice in Montana. The court concluded that the Legislature did not create an exception from the provisions of &sect; 25-2-122(2) for FELA claims because &sect; 25-2-122 did not expressly exclude FELA claims, thus it applied to FELA claims. The court held that under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 25-2-122(2), the state courts of Montana remained open to FELA plaintiffs on the same basis that they were open to tort litigants with causes of action springing from a different source. The court held that the employee failed to establish any reason why application of &sect; 25-2-122(2) to FELA cases exceeded legislative discretion in enacting venue statutes. Therefore the court concluded that the employee had not met his burden of proving &sect; 25-2-122(2) was unconstitutional. The court held that the trial court properly applied the venue statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for raping a handicapped neighbor after attempting to kill her by breaking her neck. Defendant challenged the mandatory life sentence imposed pursuant to Mont.

Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-222(3) was not applicable. The court found that the trial court properly considered the exception and found it did not apply because defendant did not commit the crime under unusual or substantial duress. The court rejected defendant's claim of procedural and substantive due process violations, holding that the trial court correctly interpreted Mont. Code Ann &sect; 46-18-219 and afforded defendant due process when it sentenced him within the statutory sentencing limits. The court also rejected defendant's cruel and unusual punishment claim on the grounds that defendant was a serial rapist with a high risk to reoffend and was not likely he would be rehabilitated, and that the sentence was commensurate with the gravity of his crime. The court also held that there was no violation of separation of powers concerning the mandatory sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen brought suit against defendant school board trustees alleging the board violated open meeting laws when a contract was made between a school district and a contractor without any bidding. The District Court of the Third Judicial District, Granite County, Montana, entered a summary judgment in the board's favor. The citizen appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the citizen contended, inter alia, that the school superintendent did not have the authority to apply federal grants, the trial court abused its discretion by failing to void the contract in question, and the school district should have bid out the contract. While the superintendent did not have statutory authority to apply for grants, there was an affidavit stating that the school board delegated it's authority to apply for grants to the superintendent. As the citizen only offered a speculative statement that this affidavit was insufficient proof, the appellate court held that he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact. However, the superintendent signed the contract before obtaining the school board's approval; thus, the contract exceeded the superintendent's authority. Still, the appellate court could not determine a specific remedy, as the contract had already run its course and had presumably expired; this was a question more appropriately addressed by the trial court. As this was a public services contract, the school district was required to let the contract to the lowest responsible bidder in accordance with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 20-9-204(3) (2001).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The university's policy prohibited gay employees from receiving insurance coverage for their same-sex domestic partners. The employees and their partners contended that this violated Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4. After the district court granted the university's motion to dismiss the declaratory action, the employees and their partners sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the district court erred by finding that the university's classification was based on martial status. Actually, the policy allowed the opposite-sex partners of employees to apply for benefits by signing an affidavit. The signing of the affidavit did not create a common law marriage between the parties under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-1-403. In order to establish a common law marriage, three elements had to be satisfied. A mere affidavit was insufficient. Because the unmarried partners of employees were treated differently by the university's policy, and there was no justification for such, Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4 was violated because the policy was not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As police officers were executing a high risk search warrant on a suspected drug dealer's home, defendant, the drug dealer's neighbor, telephoned and advised him through a telephone answering machine that police officers were surrounding his house. Defendant was arrested and later convicted for attempting to obstruct a peace officer. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying her motion to suppress, in admitting certain evidence, and by failing to fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. The appellate court noted that despite defendant's protestations that she did not intend, or have the purpose, to hinder the officers, the evidence was sufficient to convict her of attempting to obstruct the police in their efforts to perform a legally authorized search; thus, her motion to suppress was properly denied. The appellate court held that under the transaction rule, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed the State to introduce evidence regarding the high-risk nature of the law enforcement event. The appellate court concluded that the jury was fairly and fully instructed on the law applicable to the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Court concluded that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Hardy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision applies retroactively to require payment of stacked uninsured, underinsured motorist and medical payment insurance coverages in qualifying circumstances on open claims arising before its issuance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff class members filed an action against defendant insurer to recover benefits under their policies. The insurer filed a motion to dismiss. The United States District Court, District of Montana, Butte Division, certified a question concerning the retroactive application of case law involving the stacking of underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits and medical payments to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class members contended that the retroactive application of Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Insurance Co. entitled them to recover payments previously denied based on stacking limitations in the policies. The question of whether the case was retroactively applied was certified to the court. In finding that the case did have retroactive application to cases not yet final, the court examined its rules on the issue. It determined that the rules of retroactivity set forth in Chevron Oil v. Hudson still applied in Montana as an exception. All civil decisions from the Montana Supreme Court applied retroactively to cases pending on direct review or not yet final, unless all three of the Chevron Oil v. Hudson factors were satisfied. The court then determined that the Hardy case applied retroactively because the insurer was unable to even meet the first Chevron factor. The court held that Hardy did not establish a new principal of law because it did not clearly overrule past precedent or decide an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed. Dissatisfaction with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 33-23-203 had been expressed in other cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the case applied retroactively to all cases pending on direct review or not yet final.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board developed a goals granted and vested the superintendent with the authority to apply for the grant. The superintendent made application and then set aside funds for various teacher education programs. The individual brought an action against the school board and the trustees seeking to void the grant. The matter was arbitrated, but the individual failed to cooperate. As a result the trial court refused to void the goals grant and issued sanctions against the individual. The individual appealed the judgment. The court noted that the school board was vested with the discretion to delegate authority with regard to grants. However, the authority in this case was delegated to the superintendent only to apply for the grant, and it did not include spending the money. The dilemma was what to do with the violation when the grant had been approved, the money had been spent, and the grant had expired. The court opted to reverse and remand the matter to the district court for further proceedings on this dilemma. Furthermore, the court found that the application of sanctions under Mont. R. Civ. P. 11 was erroneous, which mandated reversal as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Activists sued to challenge the constitutionality of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-1-120, which exempted licensed video gambling machine operators from local anti-smoking ordinances that were more restrictive than the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act of 1979, Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 50-40-101 to 109. The court held that the exemption in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-1-120 was not a prohibition because the exemption did not deny cities the power to act, but merely created an exception to certain ordinances. Although Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-1-112(5) prohibited local governments from regulating gaming establishments, local anti-smoking did not regulate gaming, but merely regulated the air inside all buildings, whether or not gaming occurred in such buildings. Therefore, because Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-1-120 did not expressly prohibit local governments from enacting restrictive anti-smoking ordinances, and because such ordinances were not inconsistent with Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-1-112(5), Mont. Code Ann.&nbsp;&sect; 7-1-120 did not preempt any local anti-smoking ordinance and was ineffective. Because &sect; 7-1-120 was ineffective rather than unconstitutional, the activists were not entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. Setting aside the testimony of the accomplice entirely, the jury heard eye-witness testimony that defendant pursued two men towards the place where the victim was walking home. The jury also heard that defendant was extremely angry about his car being broken into. A witness testified that defendant confronted someone resembling the victim in the alley. Jurors also heard evidence that an altercation probably ensued in the alley. Police found the victim's body several feet away from the initial confrontation spot with at least four severe blows to the head. In particular, two skull wounds that produced a depression were matched with the ball-peen hammer found in proximity to the victim's body. Further, the shape and the size of the fractures in the skull were a signature of the instrument and accounted for the multiple fractures. Therefore, the corroborating evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montana Workers' Compensation Court granted judgment in favor of respondent Montana State Compensation Insurance Fund by rejecting appellant employee's workers' compensation claim, holding that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-710 was constitutionally sound because the receipt of social security retirement benefits was a yardstick for determining whether there would be future wage loss and it did not violate equal protection. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee argued that the age limitation on permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits, set forth in Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-710, violated Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4. The employee maintained that the two classes involved were PPD eligible claimants who received or were eligible to receive social security retirement benefits and PPD claimants who did not receive and were not eligible to receive social security retirement benefits. The appellate court concluded that the classes were similarly situated for equal protection purposes. The disparate treatment of partially disabled claimants based upon their age, because they were receiving or were eligible to receive social security retirement benefits, was not rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of establishing a wage replacement for injured workers. Social security retirement benefits and social security disability benefits were two distinct programs and could not offset one another due to the fact that both were based on completely different concepts. There was no rational basis to deny a class of injured workers a category of benefits based upon their age.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and remanded to the workers' compensation court for redetermination of benefits due to the employee.</SPAN></P>

She filed a workers' compensation claim arising out of the accident and hired an attorney to represent her. The employee and attorney entered into a contingent fee arrangement whereby the attorney was to recover 25 percent of the post-judgment award. The matter proceeded to trial and the claim was found to be compensable. The compensation court awarded attorney fees at an hourly rate instead of the amount requested by the employee. The employee appealed. The court affirmed the compensation court's ruling that the hourly attorney fee rule of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-71-614 (1999) passed scrutiny under substantive due process. The court also agreed that &sect; 39-71-614 did not violate equal protection because workers with large awards were not a separate class from workers with smaller awards.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a supplemental order of the District Court for the Eleventh Judicial District, Flathead County (Montana), which reduced the amount of restitution that he was required to pay after he pled guilty to felony aggravated assault and criminal mischief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot his victim in the face as the victim sat in a car. His prison sentence was conditioned on the payment of restitution in the event he was paroled. At a resentencing hearing, the restitution was decreased. On appeal, the court declined to address defendant's constitutional challenges to the amended restitution statutes, as he did not establish standing by showing a direct or threatened personal injury resulting from application of the statutes. Rather, his restitution was determined under a previous version of the statutes and, according to the length of time he would have to pay it, only part of it was for property damages, and the only effect the amended statutes would have had on him was requiring him to pay the department of corrections rather than the clerk. The court held that the district court adequately complied with the statutory requirements in determining the amount of restitution, which was based on the victim's special damages and a grant from the board of crime control, because it relied on testimony, a psychiatric evaluation, and presentence investigations showing that defendant had no documented disabilities and stated that he was a hard worker.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee department of human services filed a petition seeking permanent legal custody of the child and termination of appellant father's parental rights with right to consent to adopt. The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Mineral County, Montana, terminated the parental rights of the father, and the child was adopted. His motion seeking relief from judgment was denied. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the father had essentially abandoned his child, as he had not developed a substantial relationship with the child, had not provided support for the child for over a year, and was serving a lengthy incarceration for sexually abusing the mother's other children. On review, the father contended the trial court erred when it denied his motion for relief from judgment because his parental rights were terminated without providing him certain required due process protections. The appellate court disagreed, finding that the record did not support the father's lack of notice argument, as the department made numerous attempts to obtain information from the father and he failed to respond. Further, the father's motion was over two years late. Contrary to the father's contention, the record indicated that he was, at the very least, aware that termination proceedings were pending against him and a hearing to terminate his parental rights was imminent; regardless of any technical deviation from the requirements controlling service of process, it was unreasonable to wait more than two years after becoming aware that his parental rights were about to be terminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Missoula County (Montana), convicted defendant of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, fourth offense, and driving while license suspended or revoked, a misdemeanor. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant was stopped, he smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot eyes. The officer read him the required preliminary alcohol screening test (PAST) implied consent warning and defendant provided a breath sample. He later provided a second sample, which the trial court excluded, as it was seized unlawfully. Only one PAST was allowed to be taken. The trial court properly concluded defendant's earlier DUI convictions were constitutionally firm. Defendant did not overcome the presumption of regularity through direct evidence. The trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's motion in limine that questioned the reliability of the PAST and contended it was inadmissible as evidence of his guilt. Because the PAST was presented for the purpose of proving an element of the charged crime, intoxication, the State had to prove it would not have contributed to the conviction. The State did not meet this burden. The trial court properly allowed the officer to testify that defendant was under the influence of alcohol. He testified that, based on the odor of alcohol, defendant's bloodshot eyes and slurred speech, and defendant's driving behavior, defendant was under the influence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the trial court for retrial, during which the State could pursue a DUI conviction utilizing admissible evidence consistent with this opinion. The trial court's decision regarding the admissibility of the PAST evidence was reversed. The trial court abused its discretion in allowing even the first Alco-Sensor III test to be used as evidence of defendant's guilt at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate and his co-defendants, while in their respective cells, each knowingly possessed a sharpened metal object known as a &quot;shank.&quot; After they refused to surrender the shanks, an officer successfully forced each to submit the shanks. After his plea was entered, the district court sentenced the inmate to five years in prison to be served concurrently with a sentence for criminal mischief the inmate received in a companion case. On appeal, the inmate argued that, pursuant to the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, his sentence was disproportionately severe when compared to his co-defendants' sentences, and therefore constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The appellate court held that the inmate received the sentence he bargained for in his plea bargain, the voluntariness of his guilty pleas were not at issue, and his sentence fell within the maximum guidelines. Thus, the sentence did not violate cruel and unusual punishment protections. Moreover, because the inmate failed to raise any Eighth Amendment claim on direct appeal, it was barred under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-105(2). The inmate's remaining claims were also barred and not preserved for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, (Montana) of assault on a peace officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately explain the nature and terms of a plea offer. Defendant testified at the hearing and was afforded ample opportunity to present arguments and raise objections. Throughout his testimony, defendant repeatedly denied having received any information from counsel concerning the State's plea offer. Counsel testified that he conveyed the State's oral plea offer of 10 years and withdrawal of the persistent felony offender designation to defendant, but conceded that he might have stated that the offer was illusory, since the maximum sentence was 10 years. Counsel further described defendant as insistent about his innocence and in his desire to go to trial. The trial court concluded that counsel's conduct in communicating the plea offer did not fall below the standard of reasonable representation required of criminal defense attorneys and that defendant was fully informed of any plea offer made by the State, and defendant chose to proceed to trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four sentencing conditions were reversed and stricken from the written judgment on remand. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant advocates sought a declaratory judgment in the District Court of the Eleventh Judicial District, Flathead County, Montana, that respondent Montana Department of Natural Resources unlawfully determined that Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that no justiciable controversy existed and that the complaint alleged no cause of action upon which relief could be granted. The trial court agreed and dismissed the complaint concluding that the advocates were not entitled to relief under any set of facts which could be proved in support of its claim. The appellate court held that any determination that the department exceeded its authority and failed in its duty to uphold the legality of Montana laws when it stipulated that the statute in question was unconstitutional, had absolutely no bearing on existing rights or interests at issue between the parties, and a judgment from an appellate court granting the relief sought would not effectively operate to resolve any controversy. The appellate court further held that any declaratory judgment would have been abstract and theoretical because the claim applied to no specific statute at issue or specific rights of the litigants in the case; therefore, there was no justiciable case or controversy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured sledder appealed from a judgment of the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, in and for the County of Cascade (Montana), which granted summary judgment to defendant City in the sledder's negligence and willful or wanton misconduct action, arising from injuries she sustained when she slid into a safety net that the City had installed at the bottom of a sledding hill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City had installed a safety net at the bottom of the sledding hill in order to cushion sledders who did not stop on their own. The sledder was injured, and she sued the City. The City sought summary judgment, claiming that it was immune from the negligence claim under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 70-16-302, which was part of the Recreational Use Act. The trial court granted summary judgment to the City, finding it was immune from the negligence claim and that willful or wanton misconduct was not shown. It also rejected the sledder's challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 70-16-302, holding that it was time-barred under Mont. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11(6). On appeal, the court declined to consider the constitutionality question, as there was no compliance by the sledder with the notice requirements of Mont. R. App. P. 38. The court found that the immunity of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 70-16-302 applied, as sledding was within the definition of &quot;recreational uses&quot; under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 70-16-301. The City showed that it had investigated ways to prevent injuries, and the sledder did not meet her burden of offering evidence to raise an issue of fact as to the City's willful or wanton misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the District Court of the Nineteenth Judicial District, in and for the County of Lincoln (Montana), which denied her motion to suppress evidence that was obtained from a search of her person and of the car that she was in. Defendant was charged and found guilty of possession of dangerous drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was pulled over by the police for making an improper lane change. The police discovered that the car that defendant was driving belonged to an individual who was suspected of involvement with dangerous drugs. The police indicated that defendant was going to be issued a warning. However, one officer noticed that she appeared nervous, and he asked if she would empty her pockets and if he could search the vehicle, both of which she consented to. A piece of cellophane that was suspected of containing illegal drugs came from defendant's pocket. Defendant admitted it contained methamphetamine, and, after it field tested positive for that, defendant was arrested and charged. Her motion to suppress was denied, and she was convicted. On appeal, the court found that suppression was properly denied, as defendant was lawfully detained subsequent to the traffic stop, and the duration was not overly long under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-5-403. However, a reasonable person would have felt free to leave in the circumstances. Thereafter, defendant's consent to the warrantless search was based on a voluntary exchange with the officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was appointed to represent a client in a post-conviction proceeding. After many months had passed, the trial court inquired into the attorney's failure to take action. The attorney explained that she had personal problems, but assured the trial court that a brief and motion to withdraw from the case were forthcoming by a certain date. The attorney failed to file the papers, and she refused to take a phone call from the trial court. In a later hearing, the attorney was found in contempt, ordered to pay a fine, and sentenced to jail time. She then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. In denying the writ, the court determined that the trial court was permitted to hear the contempt case under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 3-1-518 (2001), as amended, because the contempt arose from the violation of an order issued after a hearing on the merits. Section 3-1-518 was not unconstitutional because due process was clearly provided in the terms of the statute. The attorney failed to show that the judge was not impartial simply based on a statement regarding the attorney's credibility. The attorney did not present any other grounds in support of her request for a neutral magistrate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition for postconviction relief on the basis that it was time-barred. Defendant maintained that the amendment of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-102, which reduced the time for filing of a petition for postconviction relief, deprived him of the five-year filing period to which he was entitled. The supreme court concluded that defendant had approximately a year and a half prior to his conviction becoming final to absorb this change. The district court did not err in its determination that the petition was time-barred. Defendant also argued that the statute of limitation should be equitably tolled during the time defendant was incarcerated in another state. Nevertheless &sect; 46-21-102 was a jurisdictional limit on postconviction litigation, and the supreme court held its waiver may only be justified by a clear miscarriage of justice. Further, the time bar did not constitute a violation of defendant's constitutional right against ex post facto laws. Finally, 13 of the 14 issues defendant raised were procedurally barred for failing to raise them on direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

The owners filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award. The District Court of the Eleventh Judicial District, In and For the County of Flathead (Montana), granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings by the FCD and respondent Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. The owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved a dispute between the owners and two agencies, the FCD and the Flathead Regional Development Office (FRDO). The FCD administered the Natural Streambed and Land Preservation Act of 1975 (Streambed Act), Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 75-7-101 et seq., and the FRDO administered the Flathead County Lakeshore Protection Program (Lakeshore Program), governed by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 75-7-201 et seq. The owners argued that the arbitration panel was without authority to decide the jurisdictional question as to whether the situs of their project was a lake or a stream. The court stated that the FCD could determine what bodies of water were streams. Accordingly, an arbitration panel could review that determination. Application of the Lakeshore Program did not preclude application of the Streambed Act to a particular area, especially in situations where a construction project might be located simultaneously in a lake and where a river once flowed before lake waters were expanded as a result of construction of a dam. The court also held that the owners' partiality allegations relating to one of the arbitrators did not establish &quot;evident partiality&quot; under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-5-312(1)(b).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's trial counsel moved to disqualify a juror for cause based on the juror's employment as a detention officer. The district denied the motion after the juror was questioned outside the presence of the jury panel. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial. The court stated that the bare fact that a potential juror was connected with law enforcement did not, without more, necessitate a finding of bias resulting in a dismissal for cause. Here, the juror's testimony did not reveal a state of mind in reference to defendant that would have prevented her from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of defendant. Defendant also argued that he was given ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to advance the statutory criteria of a guardian-and-ward relationship, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-16-115(2)(b) (1999), to remove the juror for cause. The court rejected defendant's argument, concluding that, notwithstanding any constitutional or statutory responsibilities a detention officer or guard might have toward a detainee, such responsibilities did not meet the requirements of a guardian-ward relationship.</SPAN></P>

The inmate claimed he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal and that his consecutive sentences should have been concurrent. The appellate court ruled that trial counsel was not ineffective. Concerning each issued raised by the inmate, the record established that trial counsel conferred with the inmate in regard to the decision at issue, and the record established that each of the issues were discussed with the inmate and that a strategic decision was made about each. Also, appellate counsel made an informed and strategic decision to raise the single, best claim that he could, and the inmate failed to show that appellate counsel made the decision through neglect or through ignorance of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual sought to place two obscenity ordinances on the election ballot. Previous ordinances had been struck down by the Montana courts. The county filed a complaint requesting that the district court issue an opinion concerning the constitutionality of such ordinances under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 7-5-135. The district court declined to make such a determination regarding the subject matter contained therein, stating that it would result in the rendering of an advisory opinion. Thereafter, the county sought review. In reversing, the court determined that the intent of the Montana Legislature could have been determined from the plain meaning of the words in &sect; 7-5-135(1). The language was plain, unambiguous, direct, and certain. When a suit was filed pursuant to &sect; 7-5-135(1), a district court, after any briefing and fact-finding it deems appropriate, was required to determine whether a proposed ordinance would be valid and constitutional if passed. Therefore, &sect; 7-5-135(1) required substantive review of the proposed ordinances by the district court.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. II, &sect; 28(2). However, the Montana Supreme Court had previously ruled on the constitutionality of SVORA in State v. Mount. There, the supreme court held the &quot;full rights&quot; restored under art. II, &sect; 28 following termination of state supervision for a criminal offense were civil and political rights incident to citizenship, including the right to vote, hold office, and enter occupations that required state licensing, and that privacy was not a right protected under art. II, &sect; 28. The State had the requisite compelling interests in enacting SVORA, including protecting the public.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff senators brought a complaint against defendant Montana Secretary of State, arising out of the 2003 redistricting of the State of Montana into 100 house districts and 50 senate districts for election of the state legislature. The senators were assigned to redrawn districts. The First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, Montana, granted summary judgment for the senators. The Secretary of State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The senators were elected to office with terms to run for four years. The district assignments of the senators differed from the Districting and Apportionment Commission's assignment. The issue on appeal was whether the Montana Constitution prohibited the Montana Legislature from enacting legislation establishing a procedure for assigning holdover senators to newly-drawn districts? The appellate court concluded the Montana Constitution's mandate that the Commission effect redistricting was self-executing and that, as the history of implementation illustrated, the power to assign holdover senators to districts was an inherent part of the redistricting process. By granting redistricting authority to the Commission under the constitution, it denied the legislature any latitude to invoke its plenary powers. The legislation designed to transfer the power to assign holdover senators from the Commission to the legislature violated Mont. Const. art. V, &sect; 14.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that &sect; 45-9-132 was unconstitutionally vague on its face because a person of ordinary intelligence could be in possession of supplies, equipment, and materials commonly used for purposes other than the manufacturing of methamphetamine, subjecting that person to arrest for operating an unlawful clandestine laboratory. The court stated that given the specificity of the relevant statutes, it was difficult to imagine how a person of ordinary intelligence could fail to understand what conduct was forbidden under &sect; 45-9-132.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant media entities challenged a decision of the District Court of the First Judicial District, in and for the County of Lewis and Clark (Montana), which partially granted and partially denied the entities access to certain documents filed by respondent power company with respondent Montana Public Service Commission (PSC) under a protective order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed documents with the PSC under a protective order. The entities filed this action seeking the disclosure of certain information contained in the documents. The trial court partially granted the request. On appeal, the court reversed. The court first held that the intent of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 9, 10 was to limit protection of privacy to natural human individuals. The court overruled Mt. States, Etc. v. Dept. of Pub. Serv. Reg., 194 Mont. 277 (1981), and its progeny to the extent the decisions relied on the Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 9 constitutional balancing test of the right of individual privacy against the public's right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions as a basis for protecting trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information of non-human entities. Because the media bypassed the PSC in filing this action, the court remanded the case to the PSC for its consideration. The court agreed that Mont. Admin. R. 38.2.5004, 38.5.5007(a) abrogated the PSC's duty to confirm a company's claims of confidentiality. The court ordered an amendment of the rules.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the District Court of the Sixteenth Judicial District, In and For the County of Fallon (Montana), of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the results of the preliminary breath test (PBT) and the later administered Intoxilyzer breath test should have been suppressed because the advisories given to him were inadequate and misleading, and thereby amounted to a violation of his due process rights. The supreme court disagreed. The PBT advisory did not provide misleading or inaccurate information. The advisory accomplished its intended purpose of informing defendant of his choices at the time of testing and of the potentially serious consequences of refusing to submit to a blood or breath test. It did not mislead defendant into forfeiting his right to a later hearing or otherwise disturb that right. If defendant would have refused the test and his license had been suspended, he would have nonetheless retained his right to contest the suspension in the district court. Thus, there was not a concomitant due process right of an opportunity to be heard safeguarded by the advisory. In addition, defendant's right to due process was not implicated by the advisory's failure to notify him of the right to judicial review in the event he refused the preliminary breath test.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Due to defendant's bizarre conduct, his attorney requested that defendant receive a mental evaluation. Although a physician determined defendant to be competent, the trial court found him unfit to proceed and committed defendant under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-14-221. The trial court received an evaluation after 90 days that defendant was unfit to proceed and it was unknown when he would regain fitness. The trial court committed defendant for another 90 days, after which time defendant was found fit to proceed. Ultimately, he was found guilty. On appeal, the court reversed. The court rejected the State's claim that the trial court intended for defendant to receive treatment and further evaluation pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-14-202. After committing defendant, the trial court was required to review defendant's fitness within 90 days. At that time, defendant had not been found fit, nor was there a finding that it appeared that he would become fit in the foreseeable future. Absent such findings, the trial court was required to dismiss the criminal charges against defendant. After the 90-day period expired, the State lacked the power to proceed further with the criminal charges.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's conviction was affirmed, as: (1) the issue of recusal was waived, in that it was not raised in the district court and the plain error doctrine did not apply; (2) ineffective assistance of counsel was not properly before the appellate court, as the record did not show an obvious impropriety, and there was no evidence as to why defense counsel failed to seek recusal; (3) Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-220 was not vague or overbroad, in that there was a legitimate state interest in preventing stalking, the words of the statute were commonly understood, and defendant failed to show specific infringement on his First Amendment rights; and (4) the stalking statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant, in that his acts of harassment were not constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner teacher retired from a school district and received retirement benefits from the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS). He later began teaching full-time at a university and contributed to the Optional Retirement Program (ORP). Appellant teachers' retirement board suspended his benefits. On review, the District Court of the First Judicial District of Lewis and Clark County, Montana, reversed the board's decision. The board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the board contended the trial court erred in determining that the teacher could receive retirement benefits from the TRS while employed full-time by the state university and contributing to the ORP. The supreme court found that the trial court correctly found that the teacher was not a terminated member of the TRS, he was inactive, and Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 19-20-804 only applied to terminated members. Thus, it did not apply to the teacher. The trial court also properly found that the teacher's service through his retirement from the school district, during which time the TRS accepted his contributions, counted as creditable service for the purposes of his TRS benefits. However, the trial court incorrectly interpreted the law when it held that the teacher was entitled to receive benefits while maintaining inactive status. The teacher was precluded from receiving any further TRS benefits until such time as his status with the TRS was that of a terminated member.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's determination that the teacher could receive retirement benefits while employed full-time by the university was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had pleaded guilty to 10 counts of sexual abuse of children. The trial court denied the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief. The court affirmed on appeal. While the inmate made numerous factual allegations relating to his claims, he neglected to provide affidavits, records, or other evidence to support his allegations. The court noted that allegations in a petition for post-conviction relief did not constitute evidence. The petition failed to meet the requirements of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-104(1)(c) (1999) and thus the trial court did not err in denying the petition. Although the inmate claimed that the trial court should have granted him an evidentiary hearing on the petition, such a hearing was not required and a trial court was permitted to dismiss the petition based solely on the files and records of the case pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-201(1)(a) (1999). Another case, which held that a statute prohibiting virtual child pornography unconstitutional, did not apply in this case. Neither Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an outfitter, was convicted in the justice court of misdemeanor offenses, including failure to report the unlawful taking of wildlife by a client, Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 37-47-344, 37-47-404 (1999), and possession of unlawfully taken game, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-3-112. He appealed for a trial de novo to the District Court of the Fourteenth Judicial District, Montana, which denied his motion to dismiss. Defendant pled guilty and appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The facts giving rise to the charges occurred nearly two years before the charges. Defendant argued that the extended statute of limitations for commencing prosecution of misdemeanor fish and game offenses usurped his rights to Equal Protection and Due Process and that mandatory forfeiture of licenses was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. With regard to Equal Protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mont. Const. art. II, &sect; 4, the fish and game offenses at issue were, by legislative classification, not similarly situated with all other misdemeanors. Therefore, defendant failed to make the necessary threshold showing that the offenses were part of a similarly situated class that had subjected him to unequal treatment. With regard to Substantive Due Process, the State had a legitimate governmental interest in preserving its wildlife. Extending the period for prosecuting misdemeanor violations of fish and game laws to three years was reasonably related to that interest, as the offenses were not always readily discoverable, perpetrators often lived out-of-state, and undercover operations could span the course of several hunting seasons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sued defendant employer for wrongful discharge. The employer moved for summary judgment, arguing the employee was covered by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), and was precluded from relief under the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act, Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-2-901 to 915. The District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, In and for the County of Jefferson, Montana, granted summary judgment. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee had in fact gone through a grievance process with the union, after which her union representative told her the union would not proceed further. The employee claimed that the collective bargaining agreement was a contract of adhesion, and defied public policy because it cut off any remedy. However, it was undisputed that the CBA covered disputes between the parties, and the right to bargain collectively was recognized under Montana law. Further, no standardized form of agreement existed in the instant case, and neither contracting party had dictated the terms of the CBA to the other. Consequently, theirs was not a contract of adhesion. Secondly, the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (WDEA), Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-2-901 to 915, did not violate the employee's constitutional rights to full legal redress, and a jury trial. The WDEA did not apply to the discharge of an employee covered by a CBA pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-912(2), and the employee failed to put forth any argument to overcome the presumption that &sect; 39-2-912(2) was constitutional. Finally, the employee was not left without a remedy or access to the courts. An action against her union was possible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol (DUI), a felony, in the District Court of the Ninth Judicial District, Pondera County, Montana. Defendant reserved the right to appeal the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss, in which he argued that his four prior uncounseled tribal court DUI convictions could not be used to enhance his sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Scott v. Illinois, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applied to state proceedings pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment. An uncounseled conviction that resulted in &quot;imprisonment,&quot; violated the Sixth Amendment. While Native Americans were citizens, the United States Constitution did not apply to Indian tribes. The Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA), afforded many protections of the Bill of Rights to Native Americans, but the Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not included. Without much explanation, the Tenth Circuit, in United States v. Benally, held that, in sentencing an Indian, a court could consider the defendant's uncounseled tribal convictions. The Montana Supreme Court agreed, but focused on the issue of a tribe's sovereignty. In other words, treating tribal court judgments with the same deference as those of foreign sovereigns as a matter of comity. The ICRA enabled the tribes to adopt their own tribal court and criminal justice system. An uncounseled tribal conviction did not violate the Blackfeet tribal code and was valid in the tribal court. Thus, defendant's tribal convictions were valid in their inception and could be used to enhance his sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, Montana, dismissed the appellant mother's petition for judicial review of the denial of her request for arbitration of the child support obligation that was determined to be owed by respondent father for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The mother appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue on appeal was whether the mother's due process rights were violated when the district court dismissed her petition because she failed to comply with the service requirements of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-5-253(4). The father claimed on appeal that the mother failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. Nevertheless, he failed to cross-appeal the trial court's rejection of the argument; therefore, the argument was waived. Finally, as to the father's statement that a jurisdictional argument could be raised at any time, untimeliness of the request for arbitration would not be jurisdictional for purposes of seeking judicial review in the district court. The mother's original mailing of a copy of her petition to the father's attorney, which had not been challenged as untimely, was sufficient service upon the father. Dismissal of the petition for judicial review on the basis of failure to follow the Mont. Code Ann. &sect;40-5-253(4) service requirements would violate the mother's right to due process of law. Therefore, the district court erred in dismissing the petition for judicial review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that the department of corrections did not have the authority to transfer him. Specifically, he argued under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 53-30-101 (1995), Deer Lodge was designated the state prison and any application of the amended statute, to include other institutions, was an unconstitutional ex post facto law. The appellate court noted that while the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited a state from depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, it did not require the State to have more than one prison or guarantee that a prisoner would be placed in any particular prison if it had more than one prison. The appellate court held being transferred from one prison to another was not a significant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life or that it had an adverse affect on the confinement. The appellate court concluded the inmate's sentence was to ensure that he served at least 20 years, not to confer on him a privilege to serve it in a particular prison.</SPAN></P>

Those were the lack of a stable home and safe environment. Because of the natural mother's demonstrated inability to care for her children, the father's treatment plans put the onus on him to provide a safe environment for the child. Both of the father's treatment plans listed one of his primary goals as &quot;to provide a stable home for his child with adequate housing and income.&quot; Therefore, because the father's treatment plans did identify the threshold problems or conditions creating the substantial risk of harm to the health and welfare of the child, the plans were appropriate.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court disagreed. The officer did not initiate a stop of defendant's vehicle. Instead, defendant exited the interstate, parked at a gas station, and entered the building on his own volition. The officer, after receiving a citizen tip regarding a possible drunk driver, subsequently requested that defendant accompany him outside for further questioning. There was no evidence in the record which indicated that the officers restrained defendant's liberty by means of physical force or show of authority. To the contrary, the evidence suggested that defendant was free to disregard the officer's request and walk away at any time during the initial encounter. In view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, the officer's initial actions did not amount to such a show of authority that a reasonable person would have believed he or she was not free to leave. Therefore, the encounter did not constitute an investigative stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge argued the Montana Judicial Standards Commission was a constitutionally-mandated body under Mont.

Specifically, he contended the state constitution did not explicitly or impliedly grant the commission any authority to adopt rules which assess costs and fees on a judge found to have violated the Montana Canons of Judicial Ethics. The supreme court initially noted the Montana Constitution was very explicit as to what sanctions it could impose on a justice or judge; namely, retirement, censure, suspension, or removal, and that the list of sanctions was exclusive. The supreme court held the express mention of the above sanctions implied the exclusion of non-expressed sanctions; therefore, the imposition of costs and attorney fees exceeded the power granted to either the commission or the supreme court by the Montana Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty in the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, in and for the County of Cascade (Montana), to negligent arson and felony forgery. Defendant filed a petition for postconviction relief, which was denied. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion for postconviction relief because the Montana State Prison (MSP) practices regarding behavior management plans (BMP) violated defendant's right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The supreme court agreed. Numerous inmates who resided in A-block testified about the filthy, uninhabitable cells. Those inmates testified that the cells commonly had blood, feces, vomit and other types of debris in the cells they were forced to inhabit. One inmate recounted an instance where he was placed in a cell with human waste rubbed all over the walls and vomit in the corner. Reading Mont. art. II, &sect;&sect; 4 and 22 together, the BMPs and the living conditions on A-block constituted an affront to the inviolable right of human dignity possessed by defendant and such punishment constituted cruel and unusual punishment when it exacerbated defendant's mental health condition. The Montana Constitution forbid correctional practices which permitted prisons in the name of behavior modification to disregard the innate dignity of human beings, especially in the context where those persons suffered from serious mental illness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded to the district court for entry of an order requiring MSP to conform the operations of its administrative segregation units to the requirements of the opinion and to report, in writing to the district court within 180 days as to the actions taken.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Montana Department of Transportation (DOT) contracted with a company to perform construction on an interstate. A subcontractor was hired to post speed limit signs. Defendant was issued a speeding ticket while traveling through the construction zone. After defendant was convicted, he sought review in the district court. The district court upheld the conviction, and defendant sought review. In affirming, the court determined that Mont. Code &sect; 61-8-314 was a constitutional delegation of legislative authority to an administrative agency or private party. The implicit rationale behind &sect; 61-8-314 was to establish speed limits in construction zones based on traffic conditions or the condition of the project. Enumerating every possible factor for consideration would have been an impossible task for the legislature. Therefore, it was reasonable to delegate the duty to the entities most familiar with the nature of each project. Moreover, the district court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss based on insufficient evidence. Section 61-8-314 did not grant the authority to set speed limits exclusively to the DOT, and the parties sufficiently complied with &sect; 61-8-314(4)(ii).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured filed an action against defendant insurer to recover damages. The United States District Court, District of Montana, Missoula Division, certified three questions of law: (1) was the offset provision void; (2) was it against public policy to charge separate premiums for coverage, if the insured could only collect one amount of coverage; and (3) were policies void if they included certain provisions that defeated coverage.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured was injured in an accident. He sought compensation under the underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage he had for three of his vehicles. A separate premium was paid for each of the three UIM coverages. The court agreed with the insured that the policy in question was ambiguous. The court concluded that the UIM definition and offset clause in the policy violated the insured's reasonable expectations. Thus, the court held that the offset provision and definition of underinsured motorist in the policy violated state public policy, as they created an ambiguity regarding coverage and rendered coverage that the insured promised to provide illusory. The court further held that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 33-23-203 was not rationally related to the stated objective of maintaining affordable insurance in the state and constituted arbitrary and capricious action. Thus, the statute, to the extent that it allowed charging premiums for illusory coverage, was unconstitutional. The anti-stacking provision in the policy violated public policy. A policy that contained provisions that defeated coverage for which the insurer received valuable consideration was also against public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consultant entered into a contract with the tribe. He agreed to act as a director for the planning and construction of a power plant on tribal property. Because the person who negotiated the contract was later removed from office, the agreement was terminated. However, the consultant already provided services to the tribe. The consultant filed a breach of contract action; however, a signed copy of the agreement was never located. The district court entered judgment in favor of the consultant, but later granted the tribe's motion to dismiss. In reversing, the court determined that the district court erred in finding that the tribe had not unequivocally waived its immunity from suit in state court. The district court erred in concluding that an equitable exception to the Montana Statute of Frauds, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 28-2-903(1), was unable to overcome sovereign immunity. The district court should not have considered &sect; 28-2-903(1) in determining whether it had subject matter jurisdiction over the case. Whether the waiver was unequivocal depended on the language of the contract. The consultant's complaint alleged sufficient facts to vest the district court with jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant filed a petition in the Montana Workers' Compensation Court, alleging that she suffered from an occupational disease arising from her employment.

Code Ann. &sect;39-72-706 was unconstitutional and awarded claimant full benefits without reduction for non-occupational factors. The insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant began experiencing heel pain after working as a waitress for five years and was given a three-percent physical impairment rating of the whole body.

Code Ann. &sect;39-72-706 of the Occupational Disease Act (ODA) required reduction of disability benefits for non-occupational factors, while the WCA did not, her right to equal protection was violated. The court agreed that the ODA and the WCA treated similarly situated classes of workers differently. Furthermore, apportioning the claimant's permanent impairment award for her occupational disease pursuant to &sect; 39-72-706 of the ODA while providing full benefits for injured workers pursuant to the WCA was not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.

Her expectation of privacy was diminished only to the extent necessary for the police to determine ownership. Defendant testified that a driver's license was displayed in the right compartment and a checkbook was displayed in the left compartment, both of which would have been apparent upon releasing the flap and opening the wallet. While the officer could not recall if he saw the checkbook or driver's license before he conducted his search, he admitted it was possible that the identification information was readily apparent. Finally, when another officer took custody of the wallet, he found a driver's license, a social security card, and a checkbook that all indicated defendant owned the lost wallet.

The record did not support the trial court's finding that the CI personally observed the criminal behavior that she reported to the police.

In fact, there was no evidence presented at the suppression hearing indicating that the officers even asked the CI how she came by her incriminating information.

The state supreme court concluded that the offense of operating an unlawful clandestine laboratory and the offense of manufacturing dangerous drugs were separate and distinct crimes and that an individual convicted under one statute was not, for purposes of the equal protection guarantee, similarly situated to an individual convicted under the other statute. The aim of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-9-110 was to deter the production of narcotics and to eliminate the detrimental effect of dangerous drugs generally. However, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-9-132 was enacted with the purpose of criminalizing the hazards posed by the use of methamphetamine labs. Defendant had not made the requisite showing that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-9-132 affected similarly situated classes in an unequal manner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the issues were: (1) whether the trial court abused its discretion when it declined to reopen the record at the request of the Fund to allow additional evidence of the historical and anatomical differences between injuries and occupational diseases; and (2) whether the trial court erred when it concluded that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 39-72-405 (1997) of the Occupational Disease Act violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution. Because there was no indication that the evidence that the Fund sought to offer following trial was not available prior to trial and because the evidence of other claims for occupational disease were not material to the issue involved in the case, the state supreme court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the Fund's motion to reopen the evidence. In addition, the state supreme court concluded that, providing partial disability benefits to a person in the employee's situation in the amount of $ 27,027 under the Workers' Compensation Act, but limiting her wage supplement to $ 10,000 under the Occupational Disease Act violated the Equal Protection Clause found at Mont.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individuals did not own real property in their municipal jurisdictional areas (MJAs), but all qualified as eligible voters. The municipalities previously sought and obtained authorization to create MJAs and to exercise building code jurisdiction over their respective donut areas. The election provisions of SB 242 were challenged on several constitutional grounds: as violations of Mont. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 4, 13 and 17 and Mont. Const. art. V, &sect; 11(3), and as violations of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. In a similar vein, the State argued that a franchise limitation such as that found in SB 242 did not necessarily violate equal protection principles. The appellate court disagreed. A law restricting the franchise could be upheld only upon the State showing a compelling interest. The supreme court concluded that the election provisions of SB 242 disenfranchised constituents who were not record owners of real property, in violation of the Montana and the U.S. Constitutions. Moreover, the supreme court concluded that the unconstitutional provisions of the law were not severable. Finally, the request for attorney fees was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner brought suit against defendant dog owner. The dog owner brought a third-party complaint against third-party defendant city, alleging violation of due process, equal protection, statutory infirmity, double jeopardy claims, and a claim arising out of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Upon motion by the city, the 22nd Judicial District, Carbon County, Montana, granted summary judgment to the city. The dog owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The city court judge ordered that the dog owner post a bond, that the police department seize the dog, and board the dog at the dog owner's expense. The dog owner could not afford the bond, so she had the dog euthanized. The sole issue on appeal was whether the district court erred when it granted the city's motion for summary judgment on the &sect; 1983 claim pursuant to the doctrines of judicial and quasi-judicial immunity. The appellate court overruled previous case law, to the extent that it afforded the local government units immunity from &sect; 1983 liability pursuant to the doctrines of judicial and quasi-judicial immunity. The district court applied the previous case law, which misconstrued and misapplied &sect; 1983 immunities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of the Eleventh Judicial District, in and for the County of Flathead (Montana), denied appellant billboard company's petition for declaratory relief against respondent city and permanently enjoined it from operating its signs that violated the city ordinance. The trial court denied its petition for declaratory relief against respondent county in part and postponed action on its equal protection claim. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company offered billboard space for business advertisements. The billboards were subject to regulation pursuant to the city or the county's ordinances. After a road widening project forced the company to move a number of its billboards, the company's billboards were not brought into compliance with the ordinances. The ordinances directly advanced the city and county's goals of reducing visual blight and traffic hazards. Also, the ordinances reached no further than necessary to accomplish their objectives. Thus, the ordinances did not impose an unconstitutional restriction on commercial speech. Additionally, because the city's and county's officials did not have unfettered discretion regarding the issuance of permits, the ordinances did not create an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. Further, the ordinances' procedural safeguards were sufficient and there was no violation of due process. Finally, the city did not violate the equal protection clause of either the state or federal constitutions when it treated the city's welcome sign, a non-commercial sign, differently than the company's commercial signs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment and determined that the city did not violate the equal protection clause of either the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 45-9-102, and a misdemeanor violation, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 45-10-103. The Thirteenth Judicial District Court (Montana) sentenced him to the maximum five-year sentence and $ 1,000 fine and a concurrent six-month sentence. Defendant challenged the legality of the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was upheld although the district court relied on incorrect information in the pre-sentence investigation (PSI). Defendant extensively reviewed the PSI prior to the sentencing hearing and he and his counsel were afforded an opportunity to discuss the content of the PSI prior to the hearing. Neither objected to or challenged the content of the PSI that defendant later challenged on appeal. Under these circumstances, the court held that defendant's affirmation of the correctness of the information in the PSI constituted a waiver, under Orsborn, of his due process challenge. The district court provided the due process necessary to avert the utilization of misinformation in sentencing, and the sentence imposed did not exceed statutory limitations. However, as to defendant's other contention, the transcript did not show the court made a serious inquiry or separate determination, as required by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-18-231(3), into the defendant's ability to pay the fine nor inquiry into his financial resources or the nature of the burden that the $ 1,000 fine would impose. Thus the fine was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed a whitetail buck on private property within the boundaries of an Indian reservation. Under regulations promulgated by the Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Commission, big game hunting privileges were limited only to tribal members. She was charged with hunting in a closed area. After defendant pled guilty, she reserved her right to a review of the denial of her motion to dismiss the charge. The district court determined that the regulation did not violate the Montana Constitution. In affirming, the court determined that the regulation in question was not an unconstitutional violation of equal protection. Laws that afforded Indians special treatment were constitutional, as long as they could have been tied rationally to the fulfillment of the unique federal obligation toward Indians. Moreover, Indian treaties were regarded as part of Montana law. Therefore, Montana was permitted to regulate the hunting activities of non-tribal members, unless Congress or tribal self-governance matters precluded it. Despite the fact that the treaties in each tribe were unique, the Commission was permitted to apply a statewide rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence because the arresting officer did not have particularized suspicion of wrongdoing. The supreme court disagreed. Defendant was stopped after officers received a report of a drinking party, and that defendant's truck had left the party. As defendant was being arrested, he struck the officer in the face a number of times. Defendant jerked the officer's gun away from him and hit him in face with it. Defendant then got off of the officer, threw the gun into the back of his truck, and attempted to leave. The officer got to his feet and was able to retrieve the gun. He attempted to stop defendant but was unable to and defendant fled the scene. The evidence of defendant's criminal conduct committed against the officer was so attenuated from the claimed improper investigatory stop that the evidence of his conduct lost its primary constitutional taint--if, indeed there ever was any--and that evidence was, therefore, not subject to the exclusionary rule.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an injured railroad employee, appealed the order of the District Court of the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County, Montana, dismissing various counts of his complaint against respondents, the railway company and its claims representative, based upon the conclusion that the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 51 et seq., was the exclusive remedy available to the injured employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for a railway company for 20 years. Over time, the employee incurred serious back injuries as a result of lifting loads of 200 to 300 pounds. Ultimately, he was forced to stop working. A claims representative working on behalf of the railway offered him an agreement under which the employee would forego pursuing his legal rights under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 51 et seq., in return for a proposed settlement. However, no settlement offer was ever made. The employee filed suit under FELA for his physical injuries and under state law for post-injury claims mishandling. The railway raised federal preemption as a bar to the state law claims. The court reviewed the matter and disagreed. The state claims were not preempted by FELA, which did not provide a remedy for post-injury claims mishandling. Montana had an overriding interest in protecting its citizens from bad faith claims practices pursuant to the Uniform Trade Practices Act, Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 33-18-101 et seq. The employee was permitted to proceed with his action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers appealed an order of the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County (Montana), granting summary judgment to respondents, the State of Montana, the county treasurer, and the county commissioners (hereinafter State), and holding that the tax levy for the vocational technical schools (vo-techs) pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 20-25-439(1) did not violate the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vo-techs were partially funded by the property taxes in the counties in which they were located. The supreme court held that the district court erred when it determined that the protections of the uniformity rule were no longer in Mont. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 3. However, the supreme court concluded that the district court was correct in holding that the analysis under art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 3, and under the equal protection was the same for purposes of the taxpayer's case. In determining whether the vo-tech levy violated the state or federal constitutions, the district court properly held that the vo-tech levy was rationally related to the legitimate government interest of providing partial funding for the vo-techs because the vo-techs provided specific benefits to their individual counties as the attendance at the vo-techs was primarily by local residents. Therefore, the attendance by local residents and the course offerings served as a rational basis for putting the counties with vo-techs in a separate class for purposes of the vo-tech levy. Therefore, the vo-tech levy as mandated by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 20-25-439(1) did not violate the state or federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved petitions alleging taxation without irrigation. The taxpayers claimed that they could not obtain the irrigation water encompassed by the MID and they should not be required to pay a yearly tax for irrigation services. The MID appealed an adverse decision, and the court affirmed, stating that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 85-7-1802(2) (1997) did not deny equal protection under the law, as the legislative objective was legitimate. Whether the legislation applied to the entire state or only to one county, the declared objective was the same: to offer persons who were not served by the irrigation district works relief from assessments. In addition, the legislature's classification was rationally related to its objective, because its narrow classification was simply a valid legislative choice in an attempt to deal with a problem one step at a time. The court further stated that Mont. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 85-7-1802(2), 85-7-1846 (1997) did not deny due process of the law, because there was an adequate opportunity for a hearing. The MID failed to show that the four res judicata elements were met; accordingly that doctrine did not prohibit the exclusion of land from the MID.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the district court against the MID, in the taxpayers' action challenging a yearly tax for irrigation services.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of the 16th Judicial District, County of Rosebud, Montana, entered summary judgment for defendant state, defendant Montana Department of Revenue, and intervenor energy company. The counties and individuals appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The counties and the individuals specifically challenged the legislature's decision to tax coal gross proceeds and oil and gas net proceeds in support of school equalization funding. At issue on appeal was whether the district court erred in concluding that classification of property for taxation was not statutorily or constitutionally mandated in Montana. The counties and the individuals argued that the supreme court and the framers of the 1972 constitution rejected uniformity of taxation in favor of a system of taxation based upon classification. The supreme court disagreed. The appellate court concluded that the conflict existing between the statutory provisions in the legislative bills and Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-6-101 did not invalidate the more specific statutes taxing coal gross proceeds and net proceeds of oil and gas. The district court did not err in concluding that the two legislative bills did not violate the counties' and the individuals' constitutional right to equal protection and due process of the laws. Moreover, the Montana Department of Revenue, in researching the legislative bill, did not violate separation of powers provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court found that defendant's petition for postconviction relief was procedurally barred by the statute of limitations provided in Mont.

Defendant argued that the district court erred by not addressing the merits of his petition, and alleged that the &quot;interests of justice&quot; required that counsel be appointed to assist him with his petition for postconviction relief. The State argued that pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-102(1), the district court properly dismissed defendant's petition on procedural grounds. The reviewing court ruled that defendant's petition was untimely, as his petition for postconviction relief was filed more than nine months after the statute of limitations had expired. Defendant's conviction became final on December 26, 1999, and he had until December 26, 2000, to file a timely petition for postconviction relief. Defendant's petition for postconviction relief was filed on October 4, 2001, more than nine months after the statute of limitations had expired. Furthermore, there was no basis upon which the reviewing court could conclude that a miscarriage of justice occurred in defendant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee State petitioned the Sixth Judicial District Court, Montana, for temporary legal custody of two children who were defined as Indian children under the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1901 et seq. The district court granted the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) temporary legal custody of the children for a period of 180 days. Appellant mother challenged the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a domestic violence incident between the parents, and allegations the father assaulted one of the children, the DPHHS removed the children from the custody of their natural mother. The children's natural father and the oldest child were enrolled members of a tribe, and the other child was eligible for enrollment. Therefore, the Indian Child Welfare Act was applicable. In applying a clear and convincing standard, the appellate court concluded the record showed evidence that active efforts were employed by DPHHS to provide remedial and rehabilitative services. The appellate court felt that it was unrealistic to require DPHHS to demonstrate compliance with 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1912(d) prior to a show cause hearing on the underlying proceeding. The district court found that the father had an extensive criminal history, including several assaults on the mother. Clear and convincing evidence supported the district court's conclusion that the mother's continued custody of the children would likely result in serious emotional or physical damage to the children. The appellate court declined to address the mother's constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

The student appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student argued that the earlier order, granting him a preliminary and permanent injunction, entitled him to attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 and the private attorney general doctrine. The appellate court found that he could not receive attorney's fees because he had not prevailed in the case for purposes of &sect; 1988 because he had not received a final judgment in his favor. Awarding attorney's fees without a determination of the merits against the other party violated due process. Although the school board adopted the association's rules as their own, the association's decision to exclude the student from participating in basketball was not the board's own decision.  Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 20-3-210 only applied to matters of controversy arising in the county. The student had no right to administrative appeal of the association's decisions. No authority empowered the Office of Public Instruction to review all of the association's regarding eligibility. Students could immediately seek judicial review after the association had reached a final decision.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of the Sixteenth Judicial District, Rosebud County, Montana, subsequently imposed an 18-month jail sentence when defendant admitted to violating the conditions of his deferred sentence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended that the trial court erred by denying his petition for postconviction relief and that he was entitled to legal representation at his parole hearing.

Code Ann. &sect; 46-21-102 (1999); therefore, the trial court did not err in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the petition. Defendant contended that the board rejected his attorney's request to attend the parole hearing because his attorney submitted the request less than 10 days prior to the hearing. The supreme court found no such requirement within Mont. Code Ann. 46-23-202 or Mont. Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alternative livestock licensees sought to enjoin defendant Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks from enforcing its interpretation of the &quot;fee shooting&quot; provisions of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-4-414(2). The District Court of the Fifteenth Judicial District, In and for the County of Sheridan, Montana, denied a motion to dissolve its preliminary injunction. The Department and intervenor sports groups appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department interpreted the &quot;fee shooting&quot; provisions of Initiative 143, codified at Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-4-414(2), to limit the shooting of animals on alternative livestock facilities to the license owner or principal manager. The district court restrained the Department from initiating enforcement actions against licensees for selling alternative livestock to third parties who would then seek to harvest their property at the licensees' facility. On appeal the Department characterized such sales as &quot;canned hunting&quot; experiences, and argued that the district court's preliminary injunction interfered with its enforcement of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 87-4-414(2), and was thus prohibited by Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 27-19-103(4). The court concluded that the activity at issue constituted the type of activity prohibited by &sect; 87-4-414(2), that the preliminary injunction interfered with the Department's execution of &sect; 87-4-414(2), a statute enacted for the public benefit, and that, as the licensees neither alleged nor demonstrated that the initiative or &sect; 87-4-414(2) were unconstitutional, the district court erred, as a matter of law, when it enjoined the Department's execution of &sect; 87-4-414(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court order denying the motion by the Department and the sports groups to dissolve the district court's preliminary injunction, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the instant opinion.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 45-5-304(1), depriving the girl's mother of lawful custody, occurred in Missoula, Missoula County constituted proper venue in defendant's prosecution. The court also denied defendant's contention under a rational relation test that &sect; 45-5-304(3) violated equal protection as applied to him, or that, considered facially, &sect; 45-5-304(3) was void for vagueness. The court held that the defense under &sect; 45-5-304(3) for those who did not leave the state was available at trial to all defendants, but that defendant was not unconstitutionally deprived of an opportunity to assert the defense at trial because a reasonable person would be put on notice that he or she may not return a child to law enforcement upon arrest in an attempt to avoid culpability under &sect; 45-5-304(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court, holding that the district court did not err in denying defendant's motions to dismiss on constitutional grounds or for improper venue.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reversed the decision. The county commissioners appealed, arguing state statutes did not preclude a county from denying a special review to mine gravel with an open cut mine in a nonresidential area within its jurisdictional zoning area. The appellate court held the county commissioners did not have the authority to deny a special review under the plain language of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 76-2-209.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant justice of the peace petitioned the District Court of the First Judicial District, In and For the County of Lewis and Clark, Montana, for a writ of prohibition to bar respondent Judicial Standards Commission from commencing further proceedings against him. The justice appealed after the trial court modified the writ of prohibition that allowed the commission to proceed and granted the commission's summary judgment motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission received a written unverified complaint against the justice for sexual assault. The commission obtained a court order that allowed it to view a criminal investigation report (CIB) on the justice. The commission filed a formal complaint based on the unverified complaint. Initially, the trial court granted a writ of prohibition as the unverified complaint was not presented on the standardized form. The appellate court held that Mont. R. Jud. Standards Comm'n 10(b)did not prevent the commission from carrying out its constitutional duty to investigate complaints from citizens, and nothing in the Montana Constitution barred the commission from investigating willful misconduct in office or violations of the canons of judicial ethics. The court also held that the commission did not exceed its jurisdiction in obtaining a copy of the CIB file on the justice or by undertaking its own investigation. As the form of a complaint alleging judicial misconduct was not critical to the commission's fulfilling its constitutional mandate, the commission did not act without or in excess of its jurisdiction in its investigation or in filing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's grant of the Commission's summary judgment motion and dismissal of the writ of prohibition was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, each individually and doing business as a construction company, appealed from the order of the District Court of the Eighteenth Judicial District, in and for the County of Gallatin, Montana, affirming the determination of the State Tax Appeal Board that certain workers were employees rather than independent contractors for purposes of state income tax withholding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Department of Revenue (DOR) determined that some of the general contractor's workers were employees rather than independent contractors and that their income was not reported to the DOR for state withholding tax purposes, nor had withholding taxes for these workers been paid. The DOR submitted a notice of assessment for tax and interest due. The DOR also submitted a notice of assessment to petitioner, as although deemed an employee for unemployment insurance purposes for the years at issue, he nevertheless filed income tax returns as an independent contractor for those years. A hearing officer upheld the assessments, the State Tax Appeal Board (STAB) affirmed the hearing officer, and the district court reviewed the record, addressed petitioner's constitutional claims, and affirmed the STAB. The appellate court held that the district did not err in upholding the State Tax Appeal Board's determination under Mont. Code Ann. &sect; &sect;39-51-201(14) (1987) that the workers in question were employees rather than independent contractors, and that Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 15-30-203(1) and Mont. Admin. R. 42.17.120 did not constitute a form of unconstitutional dual taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff client sued defendants, a financial services company and its stockbroker, for damages allegedly caused by the stockbroker's wrongful conduct. The Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, Montana, granted defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The client appealed the trial court's order compelling arbitration as well as an order denying her motion for attorney fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client opened financial services accounts with the company in 1992 and 1998. The agreements between the client and the company contained pre-dispute arbitration clauses. On appeal, the client argued that the trial court erred when it: (1) concluded that the arbitration clauses were enforceable; (2) failed to consider whether defendants owed the client a fiduciary duty to explain the arbitration provisions; and (3) denied the client's motion for attorney fees and costs. The instant court concluded that the trial court erred when it concluded that the arbitration clauses were enforceable. The arbitration provisions were not in the client's reasonable expectations. The stockbroker owed the client a fiduciary duty which included explaining the consequences of the arbitration provision defendants sought to enforce. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it failed to consider whether a fiduciary duty existed. Regarding the trial court's denial of the client's motion for attorney fees and costs, the instant court concluded that the trial court's finding that defendants did not unreasonably or vexatiously multiply the proceedings was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's order compelling arbitration was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the instant court's opinion. The trial court's order denying the client's motion for attorney fees and costs was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father argued that the district court erred in modifying child support without finding substantial and continuing changed circumstances. The appellate court ruled that it was not necessary for the district court to find that there were changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms unconscionable before the district court could modify child support. As the parties' marital and property settlement agreement contained provisions relating to child support were not incorporated into the decree of dissolution, the provisions of Mont. Code Ann. &sect; 40-4-208(2)(b) were not applicable. The appellate court also ruled that the district court correctly determined that the father's expenditures on vacations with the children did not relieve him of an actual child support contribution towards their daily needs. Furthermore, the father's fundamental liberty interests in parenting his children were not jeopardized, only his decision to withhold child support for his children's needs were affected by the district court's decision.</SPAN></P>
